Wells’ Assembly members worry that they “look like muppets ”
Some of the members of the Assembly are amazed by their proposal to change their title to CUP (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal has been provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wells.
Members of the entire political spectrum worry that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourists said his group was worried that the new name was "rhyming with Tup and Udulb."
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one of the Plaid party members, the entire group is "not happy" and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party indicated that his group was "not preconvinced" to change the name, but noted that the new name OHR (in English – MWP) has a certain reputation with a "mupet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is similar to the English Yorkshire Pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which members of the Assembly are called will belong. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave Wells the power to change his own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the Wells Parliament.
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers "members of the Wells Parliament" in short, but the CUP option has received the greatest support since the examination of society.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching a consensus is obviously going to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft draft draft on the change within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach a debate on the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the state, said he would not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campers are silenced against the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today they're both gone."
Adams shares that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialise in different ways," he added.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood daily, where everyone gathers regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he says, the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments, where people who do not help survive other shrines of the neighborhood live.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers are visiting them."
Both churches were built from white traps, before Harlem became a neighborhood of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation was carried out in the years after 1930.
Then the building became owned by black residents of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was taken by black Christians under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy damage to the fire, but Father Johnson's enoriations made a plan for her restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the “poor bells. ”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the largest system in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather mentioned that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What happened in St. Martin's over the last few weeks was a complicated story, drawn up by architects and performers, some brought by world leaders of the church and others by the bishop's diocese.
From the press – which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese "would be inclined to transfer the costs of the press", although it had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A 13-year-old child was injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representatives said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was snorkeling with his friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went along with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the kid had caught a lobster and was excited, then realized he was screaming, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he found out that his whole clavicle area was torn apart.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi children's hospital in San Diego, where it was accepted in critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, said at a media briefing that several weeks earlier in the water, a shark was spotted, but it was not considered dangerous.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
From the responsible authorities have closed access to the coastal line from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours of safety considerations while the investigation is under way.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are no danger to people.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK market for adornable products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Supercomrade and Debenhams by opening stands for beautiful products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive on the UK beauty market, which is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase, while sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, the largest ever to date can be found in 11 shops throughout the country, after which, in the success of the initiative, such ones will be found in more objects.
The investment turn in the adornment industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the walls until recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury, they said they would double the number of products offered up to 3000 products, for the first time including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more places like the proposals in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-running its buttique range of makeups, so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will try out a discount program in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London last week, while the second one will be opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on buying smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, said the facilities would look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury there are sites of Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as opening objects of Habitats since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims to have increased the sales of food goods and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to re-fuse its objects for beautiful and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury made a concerted experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the facilities of the pharmaceutical company in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with the 281 object of Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there, they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the kind and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on-the-spot.
The range of brands offered by us is intended to respond to every taste and all necessary in a seductive environment with a convenient location, making us an attractive destination for beautiful products, which challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "Anger" after Holly Willoughby's resignation from an 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons star Dan Peter Jones was "beautiful" after television host Holly Willoughby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds with his Lifesteel company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand home appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Guinette Poltrow brand.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her resignation in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones "to statue" after withdrawing from their income business with the Lifesteel brand in the last minute – and to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones "became angry" when the "golden girl" on TV admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant there would be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories to Truly.
The business is similar to the Guinette Poltrou Goop brand, with rumors that it doubled Willoughby's wealth, whose value is forecasted at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram leaving Truly, Jones left Britain on a plane to head for one of his holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave is completely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at the Marlow headquarters that's full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of this morning, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions because of a large investment in pillow- and candle-to-home products, and could also lead to a slowdown in the placing of the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, along with her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly together with Kap in 2016, like Jones, who is 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
Both families often go on vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ME&S "Employee" and will also replace Anne McParlin as the leader of the "I am a celebrity" show on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business affairs".
Heavy negotiations leading to "creation of relations"
He joked about the criticism he would suffer from news channels for making comments that someone would consider "unsuitable for the president" and too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his playful "news" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one took place in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a big step towards removing North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But negotiations to eliminate this weapon are in stasis.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea diplomat Ri Jung Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal attitude" by the United States towards its country's first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would die.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results - the termination of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the bodies of US military officers.
He also protected his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake of foreign NGOs, it was said there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it is expressed unequivocally that there is no demand for international assistance, which makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" put together a team to head to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disasters.
Although refuges in the case of tsunamis were built in Acech, they are not often common on the other shores.
The apparent lack of warning siren for tsunamis in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate even more this logistics.
Until recently stationed in Lombok for the service of the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days before he can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's lagging infrastructure into the centre of his election campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joco's re-scheduling the clocks next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, and arrows, as well as other original weapons.

"I saw the asking Cante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of her Belgian star, Ed Azar.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue turns into the latest memorial hit by "rewrite history"
Her ban will be poetic justice for his nearly Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "senseless" and "experience to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell's Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell made to the Palace of Westminster to become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Humo Thornicroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still consider to be a worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Kromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case this is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person representing one side of the divided.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be marked and celebrated."
A pig-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man identified only by his last name as Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a stake on the Liupanshui market in Guayzhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject with pig vaccines in 30 May 2005 in Sinin from the province of Cinhai, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next cabin open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a blood cell.
The forensic expertise confirmed that the 550-pound pig was attacked by a deadly farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's step was bloodied and disfigured," argues Cousin Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that the Yuan family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although rare, pigs who attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig impaled a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife succeeded in persecuting him.
After an Oregonn farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a ‘splash’ to them.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... have no intention of hurting anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect," the man concludes.
The weight loss hurricane Rose will lead to frequent and spilling rains in the southwestern United States
According to weather forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will lead to flood rains in North Mexico and southwest parts of the United States.
The rose includes winds with a power of 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane of category 1, estimated at 5 o'clock Sunday morning east time and is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
During that time, over the Pacific Ocean, a single cell is beginning to form, moving east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
During the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching sinclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At a local level of 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carrying debris streams and likely stripping in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches rain, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods under rapidly exacerbating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel a foot in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and flood winds.
The approaching Sinclair will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It's possible to get rainfall from over half an inch, which will lead to low-level waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying with them tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the U.S. while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
The majority of the Central and Eastern US are expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating scene of the nominations for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blaze Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During that time, political opposition continued, with nets breaking their regular turn-off programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that she was convinced 100% that Kavanaugh was pushing her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his absence of emotional testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely that even more than the number of 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen were watching Friday’s testimony.
The company counted the mean CBS viewers, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate data available on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has a tradition of difficulties with measuring the number of people who look from their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about an audience similar to the size of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, is the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the report, Nielsen CBS had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
Once a moderate Republican's office came out with a declaration that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras shot him playing protesters on Friday while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes, he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here, standing before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already come out with a declaration before the elevator door closed said it would be decided further during the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks provided live coverage several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Ala Flake said he would only do that if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nomination next week, which the opposition Democrats insist on.
Flake was partly convinced of his conversation with his friend, the senator of the Democrats' party Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
Its choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political dances" with Breczit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political dances" with the future of Britain and in undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the first page of the paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack against her so-called "Lame Game Plan" for Brexit, saying that collecting customs fees from Britain to the EU and the opposite is "fully absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for LSU's death
Police arrested a suspect in the final fatal shooting of Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, was arrested and sentenced to second-degree murder in prison, the police department in Baton Rouge reported.
The officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported by CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
His guarantee was set at $350,000, the Attorney informed.
East Baton Rouge's forensics office published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating a gunshot wound affecting the head and neck as a cause of death.
The government expressed their gratitude to the Department of Searching for Refugees of Louisiana State Police, Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for the aid that has contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletic sports director Jo Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average in the last season he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team had been "snared" and "shocked" since Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that worries a person all the time. ”
Vulcan sprays ash over Mexico City
Pocatepetel ash cast out of the volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after their activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ash discards have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring multiple tremors and tremors.
Published in social media photos show a thin layer of dust covering the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, since an earthquake with a magnetod 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalun separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence met with the gendarmes when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmes, began to resent the peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which usually swarm with tourists.
Later in the day, other police entanglements arose, with police officers resorting to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups cried out "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while those who declared the country's integrity returned with "Spain Forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical aid for minor injuries.
The strain remains high in the desired independence of the region even a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalunists.
The vast majority voted in favour of independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the voter voting section in the region with a number of stormy clashes.
Requesting independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to go on a different path.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hopes Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in stasis," the man added.
Despite the important victory, whether by little, in the regional elections in the last December, the supporters of Catalonia's independence, political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed captivity, or are arrested in anticipation of the process due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it is becoming more tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
He argues that "my candidate for the European elections is the best way to oppose the repression of democratic values and repression that we observe by the Spanish government".
Londonderi: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed several times in a house in Londonderi.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blommings announced that there were damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with an archulet.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston 1-0 over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The New Yorker in the Livingston High League surprised the Rangers and caused only a second loss to Steven Gerard in his first 18 matches as the club manager from the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's team leveled on points with the second in the Hiburnian ranking.
Gerard's team remains without winning a foreign field in the High League this season, and next Sunday faces the leader Harts, who is eight points behind in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers is hosting Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and manager Holt still hasn't felt the taste of loss since he changed the post Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the homeless guests
Holt's team had to lead the score far before it scored the goal, and his direct game style was extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the defense, but his shot went off, and then Alan Litgow shot at the beam after Craig Halket put the ball back on his head.
The hosts let Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously make it difficult for guests from static situations.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined with each other and took Menga, who took his ball and marked from the middle of the penal field.
So far, Rangers have ruled the ball more, but they've faced the impenetrable defense of the hosts, and Porter Liam Kelly has rarely had to interfere.
This game style continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's leg, and a blow to Littlelow's head passed by the door after another static position on Livingston.
In Livingston's criminal field, however, the centres that were easily cleaned were rolling, and the judge failed twice to respect the claims of guests for the gap – first after the unification between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve and then in doubt about playing with his hand.
"Phemental" by Livingston – Analysis
Alexander Lamont of BBC Scotland of "Tony Macaroni Arena"
Awesome game and a great score for Livingston.
The team is playing just great, continuing to overcome expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not undergo any changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a great way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warl under pressure all the time.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were much below these standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, and only once managed to break the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake Rangers who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception at Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down because of problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to discover a vast new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police have prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, yet many supporters have gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom have also raised their voice, condemning both Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect the fracture caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is also despised as a despot by others.
Road disaster in Deptford: A rider rests after a car crash
A cyclist died after a car crash in London.
The disaster occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of town, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car has stopped and medical attention has arrived, but the rider has died in place.
The disaster occurred several months after another rider died after being hit by an escaped driver on Childers Street, located near a mile from the scene of Saturday's disaster.
The city police have announced that their employees are working on identifying the man, then informing his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are deviated, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Overseeres were injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a male prison riot with a high level of security, the Prison Office reported.
The metals broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worchester at approximately 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continuing.
In order to control it, special officials from the “Tordano” squad have been called upon, who will have to deal with eight deprived of their freedom, and the riot itself is limited to one wing of prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the individuals and received medical attention on site.
A spokesman for the Department of Prisons made the following statement: “Specially trained officials have been called out to deal with the incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, and that their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the prisoner's attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October of last year, police officers from the riots were called into prison to control a heavy disturbance in which staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (though dried areas may benefit)
It is rare that Arizona will be struck by a tropical storm, but it is likely that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert of the southwest, leading with her the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established posts against lightning floods Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different path over Finland on Tuesday, with rain in late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricanes Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rockies Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches rain, with up to 4 inches rain possible in individual places.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rose may actually be a blessing because the region is seriously affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest part is currently in drought.
According to the Commission for the monitoring of the dry seasons of the United States, a little over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second in a heavy category,"weather.com reported.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to a drought at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
The rose, which on Sunday morning can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of compensation.
"Small rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible,"weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is an extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricanes Centre warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and different waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous terrains.
Attack at Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where its condition remains "stable".
At night in the Radstock area, a boy was arrested 17 years old, two boys 18 years old and a 20-year-old man reported by police in Avon and Summerset.
The cops are asking anyone who might have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from debauchery and anger" by the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that rejects the corrupt and offensive tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh was "died by the insolence and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically dismissing Christine Blazey Ford's indictment of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "Today the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence, courage and qualities."
"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president told the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly reflected Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to some of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, I am also involved," Trump continued.
"I am therefore going around and fighting to support good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats had set up a mission "to prevent and prevent".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, as reported CNN by one of the senior representatives of the Republican party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were carried off by the swept coast by giant waves when a strong earthquake and tsunami defeated the Indonesian island of Sulavessi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at night the coast was swept from waves of up to six meters (18 feet), took many to their deaths and destroyed everything along their path.
The tsunami flew after an earthquake with a 7.5 magnetod.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and they did not immediately escape, which is why many became victims of the disaster," said during a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency for overcoming the disasters of Indonesia, BNPB.
"The water had pulled cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything along its path," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Published by the disaster agency photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
The secondary shocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) came out with a declaration that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be higher along the coast 300km (190km) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is located near the centre of the tree.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, in turn, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already headed for the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticised for not informing the defeated Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Shares in social media lover videos show a man upstairs on a building who yells at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the shore and carries both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in due time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe power failure that has stopped communications around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities reported, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other first-needed products.
The city airport was opened again only for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The victims of the Indonesian tsunami are now over 800.
It's an extremely bad situation.
While the employees of the World Vision of Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found refuge in the brezent shelters scattered in the courtyard of their office, they passed by a number of scenes of desolation, says Mr. Dozeba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
It's an extremely bad situation.
Despite the work on emergency rescue and recovery operations, some complain that foreign rescuers are prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, sending of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman at the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government announced that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such status."
While over Palu falls the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still in ignorance continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraplanes for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roja-Roja hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As seniors in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roja-Roja hotel reached the paraplannerism community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26 750 during an ATM charge in Newport to Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26 750 from Brink's employee who was charging an ATM in Newport to Levi, it became clear from a press release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came near running behind Brink’s employee’s back ” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continues, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
All those with information on the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Je
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of a change in Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man, officially known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has for some time worn the nickname Ye and used it as a title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change beats his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the creator of the show told us.
In addition to his current professional title, West once claimed that the word had religious importance to him.
"I believe that "is" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you" or "you", West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
Moved from Kanye, which means only one person, just to Je – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of the many known in his field, who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences for the aliases Love and Brader Love.
One of West, J.Z.'s previous associates also presented himself as either with or without track and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force. This happened as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolko Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The US has to double the financing of II development
At a time when China becomes increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States must double its budget for research in this area, argues the researcher and developer of II Kai-fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after different units from the US government made statements on the topic of I.I., although the United States as a whole has no official I.I. strategy.
During this time China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from innovation in I.I. until 2030.
"Doubleing the budget for the development of IE will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs with regard to II," Lee said.
Double funding can also double the chances of the next major I.I. achievement coming from the United States, as Lee informed CNN in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Supersilences of II: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houndon Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the biggest companies for II in China – Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellen Lee University worked on an I.I. system that beat the most successful hijacker in America, then served as executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee owes the debt to the federal government's previous technological competitions, such as the Robotics Agency's improved research projects on defence, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government funding," Lee said.
"It is not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations," the man said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented university lights to work on I.I.
Lee further argues that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its I.I. programme.
"I believe that doctors in I.I. sciences should automatically be offered green cards," the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Leigh said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the US legislator, who wanted to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a further decades of dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area with the name Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, making it veto its integration into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott him casts a shadow of doubt as to whether the referendum will reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The question of the newsletters is this: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the form after the break-up of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old Skopje citizen.
Although the referendum does not have a binding force, enough members of parliament have decided to comply with the result of it to such a degree that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote on this.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the urns.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a citizen of the 62nd capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents held by boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us because more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his own voice.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to "confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results from a survey, according to which between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another survey, a case by Macedonian TV Telma, announced that 57% of the responders plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70% said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the entire Brighton defense and marks the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday to Etyhad Stadyum in Manchester, England.
The performance of Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentinean goalie was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outruns three Brighton defenders before he sprints the ball into the empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest of them on the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he went left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right leg struck over Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned to play it for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We're lucky you scored a goal right now."
But Sterling was the one who secured the first advance of the "heavens" in this game of the High League of England.
He signed in the 29th minute.
In the naked situation, Aguero received a pass deep in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately released a walking dog on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sanne advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The ‘heavenly blue’ attacker was able to pick up close, shortly before the ball got out.
The city will face Hofenheim in a match from the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play a game to determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no special meaning for another match of the title starting pitcher.
And yet always the ambitious Sherzer hopes to be the title on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is important for Rockies, who lead with a match ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed at least a Wild Card game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in Division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for nothing, we want to end the season with a nice game in Denver, where audiences and other teams will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they are supposed to allow Sherzer to participate if the game is decisive.
For Sherzer, it would be the 34th match as a starting pitcher this year, and he held a workout Thursday and would have the normal time to rest until Sunday.
The right-hand pitcher on Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikers in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president pointed out the situation with his constituent for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of republican votes in the general elections.
"In November everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
It's five weeks to some of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I am also saying that although I am not a candidate, I am actually also involved, that is why I am struggling with all the strengths for the right candidates," Trump said.
Afterwards, he continued, “All of you see this terrifying, horrifying, radical group of Democrats, seeing them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses of their ungodliness, of wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to get into power and government, because they're only interested in power and governance, but we won't give them any."
The Democrats, according to the president, have sought to "interrupt and hinder".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "hungry, nasty, mean and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate Judiciary Commission, mentioning the senator of Democrats Diane Finestein's name, which has caused strong noises from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I waited – it was really bad genomics – perhaps the worst I've ever seen."
The Labourists are no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerable to those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of parliament from the Labourists to whom it was stated that he is not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received this attitude, as he was determined to face anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those Jeremy expressed disagreement during the previous leaders.
The notingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that “we want meetings to include all and be beneficial. ”
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labourists in parliament, Friday's meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises of a "lighter and measured" policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of how much the party's leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues I used to work for felt that they shared similar political views began to expect me to make a reverse turn and to take positions I would never agree with – either in the national security or in the single market of the EU.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there is a whole insulting tyrad in social networks, where it is called for response, rejection of moderate policy, applications that I do not belong to the Labourists.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I even got better luck from some of my colleagues, because the comments for me are mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues who face sexist or racist distractions every day without fear of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labourists should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with every sign of mistrust or change of the rules of choice becoming ever tighter.
In the last two years, I have received many counsel to be calm, not to speak so much and that then “it will be all right. ”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Tacher government, which, through neglect, led to a literal break-up of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local adviser or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state heads to Breckzit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the head of the Labourists.
But really my message is not up to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labourists or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats from responding or political extermination will refuse me to act in the way that I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led to the ranking
The two late essays might have changed the final score, but there's no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match of Tennent's High League.
The team is already in charge of the ranking, and the only one of the ten teams has lost so far.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the game, from which coach Peter Merci and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because other teams have tested us quite seriously in past matches, and we are still without loss," Merci noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their positions better than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow by Frazier Klimo, led Air forward in the result, but yellow chart for Scotland's national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up as a result after Jason Baggot realized an essay followed by a failed additional blow.
The climate increased the head start for Air from a punitive blow just before the halftime, marking an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional blow resulting in the result of 17-5 for Air on vacation.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra blow to Bagot, reduced the lead to only five points.
After a lengthy suspension of the game due to a severe contusion of Ruardid Nott, which was carried out on the carrier, and after the renewal of the game Air increased their advance after the essay of Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to the climate.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting a strong pressure and performing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received yellow card after he knocked down the Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal act McPherson performed an essay with the help of Air's advanced offensive line.
Climo realized the extra blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the kick-off ball from David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Star of Still Game seems to be headed for a new career in the restaurant business
The Star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading towards a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The two announced that the coming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Kryglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had intended to join Glasgow's "proven restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": there is no way out of the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors are constantly patrolling the oculars with a sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are set with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It is our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit passed on to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as is the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has been the strongest for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the international court on October 1st, after five years of reflection.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is a sense of clarity and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court judge on the big screen across the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivian sovereign access to the ocean.
Here's Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to head to the disputed reelection battle next year, also bet a lot on Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to getting our access back to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility of a court making a decision in Bolivia's favor is quite small, and even if it ruled in her favor, it wouldn't change things in reality.
In the Netherlands, the UN body does not have the power to take Chile’s territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the final arguments indicates that the case is "not complex", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean was raised by the current government of Bolivia," says Zarate.
Afterwards, he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric had defaced and that the few had remained the good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after normal dialogue has happened.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by reaching benefits for both sides".
Kalzazilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political duck".
"The Bolivia will never give up its right to exit to the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea argues it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ree presented her speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises they made during a meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of re-launching the non-existent diplomacy on the nuclear issue for more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Ri called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing the sanctions and objections of the United States for a declaration to end the Korean war would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the declaration without first making significant gestures on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second date.
But there is a widespread skepticism that in China they are serious about their refusal of arsenal, in which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit the next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last scream on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sunbeams, there is no need to search for more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which rocked the fashion floor during the Fashion Week in Paris.
I caused a lot of unpractical hats in Instagram during the summer, with designers sending their creatures to crush the fashion community.
Valentino's emerging proposal was an extravagant beige hat with similar feathers wide periphery, which literally devoured the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included jeweled dunes, a magic hat and even pineapples – but they have no purpose of keeping warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of the high fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs looked like a diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted funky ice cream.
If you're into such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come shortly after “La Bomb” – the straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski..
The cult to the extremely impractical hat that takes over social networks has led to the appearance of another huge design on the fashion floor – a straw beach bag, almost as big as wearing it with a bathing suit.
The raffia bag with the color of a burnt orange, with raffia resilient and white leather handle, was an attractive all-view item in Jacqquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity Styleist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for wholesale accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career chosen by them and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal learning programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in an understanding language about him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first and foremost with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
Data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with 72% of German students, 69% of French schools and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
At present, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scient, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
As carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom Employment and Labour Skills Commission, a study showed that for reasons of difficulty for employers to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
As a result, more and more rule of foreign languages is required to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which turns these skills into essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having a similar skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages one breast in front of the competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4000 full - age UK citizens in 2013 75% did not rule foreign language well enough to be able to conduct language, with French being the only language whose rule reached a two-digit percentage with a 15% indicator.
Therefore, investment in language learning today is important for children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future until 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, regardless of what the future hides.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages must be truly considered “International communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for the fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Laker's Coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first match of the pre-season preparations against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's going to play in a fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said the joking Walton via Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell announced in Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games from Lakers' pre-season preparations.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallys tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned rallys of Trump, which include stops in famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the affirmative vote for his election to fill the Supreme Court's seat, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the term of office, as Republicans are threatened by the loss of control over Congress in the release of votes in November.
What time will be Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Weiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, east time this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review hearings this week for the Supreme Court nominations of Brett Cavanaugh, in which tensions arise over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which retains the Senate's affirmative vote for up to a week while an investigation is under way by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans raise momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallys in the coming week aim to "activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters told a campaign spokesman who refused to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willing, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit to Western Virginia will be held – a state where he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisy, who is lagging behind in the sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morris that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
“Rider bath” 2018: The US team will fight until the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue "foursom" matches on Sunday afternoon, they may have brought in what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is quite a subjective concept, in which players believe without reservation, even more in races like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They ran six points, and now they're only four, so I guess we've picked up a little momentum," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points in just twelve more for distribution.
As Spite says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans shouldn't lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the real leader of his team.
The encouraging voices of the fans became stronger as he progressed in a round in which with a precise blow he leveled the score in the fourth game after he and Thomas missed two hits after the first two holes.
His blow, which won their match at the 15th hole, was met with strong esteemed reactions that make us believe that not everything was really lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spite says.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable heroes of the Ryder Bath so far.
The strange, but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four, and it looks like everything's working out for them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "gods" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which it seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, have claimed that they are the players who will win Sunday and there will be no better pair than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory as the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
The stories of European fame, however, proved a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "Fourball" matches from the morning, while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "dubs" on the first nine holes put the Spanish and the Swedish in troubles that they failed to cope with.
But in Sunday's games, there's no one else who can solve your problems.
The Fourball and Foursom matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teamwork, and that's why they gained a significant head start before the last day, but this session of "foursom" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight until last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were highly doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Bath.
Europe will have a solid head start before the last day of Ryder Bath, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the matches of the formats "Fourball" and "Foursom" on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, with which their role in the Le Golf National competition grew to four points.
In an attempt to win back the trophy that lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated tomorrow's football matches against Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The US has shown more resistance in the Foursom matches, where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs 8 points of the 12 singles game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first rookie from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known for the name "Moliwood", became only the second pair to win four points of their first four games in Ryder Cup history after this sensational weekend.
After unappealingly outplayed Woods and Patrick Reed in the "Fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambo with an even more categorical score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two matches on Saturday, only from time to time demonstrated flashes of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in the "fourball" and "foursom" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses in total.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning football matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursom" clashes in the victory of 2 & 1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
The team of Europe, however, failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cold and cloudless day south of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas brought back the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a tough victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "Fourball" matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory MacElroy with 4&3 in the "foursum" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Bath has the team been able to catch up with four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team will keep the trophy even on equal footing.
However, since they were outplayed in two consecutive days, their chances of turning Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is no way to disarm unilaterally, without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions are deepening US mistrust and there is no way the country will give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation, Ri Young-hou said that in the last year, "significant measures of good will" were taken, for example, we stop nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a proper reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances can we first disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri was expressing known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "step" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons where North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps, his statement seemed significant, since he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as he did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the president of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim promised to work for "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump gave guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that adjudication must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is insisting "first to remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is the senseless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention whether a second meeting was planned between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In in the last five months and added: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the US, the removal of the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear weapons would not have reached such a stalemate.
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continent of the United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "a man-rocket" a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened North Korea with "complete destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain in force while North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no time limit for this and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The execution of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly's towers and then said he would again visit China next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left China in July with the words that progress had been made, but only after a few hours of North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that "the appropriate measures", which he is seeking, are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing culture for learning “all night” with the help of caffeine.
The lecturer found that the students at University number one in the world often don't even think about it when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared the course he believes to be the first in his native state in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"A girl finally came to me and said, "Why are they telling me now, in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to the students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barajra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements influence the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
Another part of the participants tells how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," Professor Kaisler added.
The culture of pride from "Learning all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and the constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid being overcharged, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in the hunger mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaisler recommends that students consider whether to set the alarm for bed and wake up and know the harmful effects of “Blue Light”, radiated by electronic screens and LED light, which can upset the circus rhythm and lead to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga goal broke Gerard team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's escape team and won 1-0 for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a guest of triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team suffered only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18 games as manager, leaving his team with eight points less than Harts' torn-off team, leader in the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga marked seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas by Rangers team at no time seemed close to evening.
After the game, Rangers took off in sixth place, and Livingston is now third, lagging behind from the second Hiburnian only in the naked.
For Rangers, there may also be additional problems, as Foreign Judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was obviously thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that destroyed Air in the semifinals of the Cup of the League of Scotland.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same one-tenth of Livingston who pulled a dot against Harts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team mated all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They had to mark back in the second minute when Menga performed a touch of Scott Pittman against the doorman Alan MacGregor, but the half-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later on, Keegan Jacobs's late center of the house found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgow detached the ball from the back beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they were unable to create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a hole in the 15th minute he met Stephen Lawles, but Stephen Thompson's report rejected the Colombian claim.
Rangers only made two precise hits during the first half, but former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly easily took the hit with Lassana Kulibali's head and the weak shot of these Edgars.
Although Livy's attack in the 34th minute was surprising with regard to the possession of the ball, it was completely deserved.
Rangers have again failed to cope with the deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed to Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a convenient game style for the hosts, while Litgou and Halket kept dropping off the long-ranged ones.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with the hit by Jacobs, and with the next cornerer Litgou shot his head off by the beam.
Entered as Glenn Middleton's reserve from Rangers asked for a shot at the end of the fight after a single fight with Jacobs, but Thompson never saw anything wrong with the situation again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the gamer counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BRONE... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger is developing a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a gamer counter.
Krahogal Stone in Science since then, the gamer counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture, when the film "Coronado's Camps" was released in 1950, which apparently included amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a gamer counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he cares right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected again in the patient
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then inject again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the National Oncology Institute of the United States in Bethezda, Maryland: "The results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several types of cancer’, including breasts, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and ‘training’ them on how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat titled "Let's Make America Great Again", in his participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was played at the studio during Saturday Night Live after making senseless performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat titled "Let us make America great again", he announced against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"I talk to white a lot and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the show with the participation of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for Appeals of Sexual Violence made by Christine Blazey Ford.
Even though it wasn't excommunicated, the record of West's performance was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock's comic book.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained in front of the auditorium that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was trampled behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been bullied!
And then they claim that I am on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship?” saying that he will wear Superman’s suit, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
The comments caused at least twice the noises from the audience and members of SNL's team seemed embarrassed, Variety said, one of them said, "The whole studio has shut down."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle of "Perrier".
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest: THANKS YOU FOR THE REMAINING OF THE TOWN.”
The leading current show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter, however, that West was simply "it was itself and it was wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person ( buying music or his clothing or supporting his "art") who I think welcomes and spreads ideology that is valuable to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, and is now "known officially as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following Didi's example, also known as Puff Didi, Puffy, and Pi Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lyon, and the musical legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
A charge of attempted murder after a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the magistrate's court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be handled by the prosecution.
The star of "Igran a Trons" Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for the role of waver John Snow in the violence-filled medieval fantasy series of NGO "Igran of Trons".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, declared himself against the stereotype of the game hero, saying showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be “serious ” in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #Metoo.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the "Play of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits to feeling "hardly convinced" that this problem should be solved.
"I am personally convinced at the moment – what was wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do growing men learn about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood because of many manly characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and the street that makes boys feel like they have to become this particular type of man?
I think this really is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the history or extensions of the Game of Thrones after the end of the series next summer, arguing that he had "ending up the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play a part in the recovery of Sam Shepherd's Real West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life in advance," he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl that Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with, in a fantasy show, the winner of the Amy award.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Hebrew HIV is rapidly distributed in some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has thus been reduced to almost zero, the Chinese Health Services said at a conference in the province of Junnan.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there is a leak of senators' data from the Republican party, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US House member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from Republicans on the pages of the legislators in Wikipedia.
The L.A. Democrats said the allegations were made by experts and websites on the "ultra right wing".
"He lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of state senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on charges of immoral sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Preservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was connected to Waters' office and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Walters continued.
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false and false claims, is in no way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"There is anger in this denial," said Fleisher.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperature suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be so challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Cavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' post in the interim elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
"Certainly, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had examined the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraud allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be subject to legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all of my team members."
"Johnny English is blowing up again" – the weak spy parody with Rowen Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Breckzit in every new film with British participation and it seems that this also applies to the rebirth of the action comedy, the spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Will self-smiling and mimes, who say how obvious it is that we are stupid, turn into a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with round eyes and a rubber face has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is of utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation designed for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims of flattering glare owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean and much of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on the leaving mess behind a traveller and an international man who Atkinson plays in the already forgotten television commercials of Barclay.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a little while, the wigs ran into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely excess, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be towards children rather than adults, but Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused, as he has no game of Actinson reminds Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is an bloated and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Tereza-Mei role, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she needs to call some retired agent because all agents in operation have been compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chico center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English has been summoned to Whitehall for urgent instruction and is reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a joyous role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent is little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in play to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beauty of Ophelia Bulletin, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the ominous Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, they light a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the house of Volta.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so sweet and lush, there is much more content here for children.
It's quite a mediocre production.
Just like other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
The Labourists deny that they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work for four weeks, but to get paid for five.
The party claims it wants company heads to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers, giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fall" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected before the end of the year to be announced about policy review.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an drive that fits into the economic rebalancing approach in favour of workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At present, however, this desire does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour speaker said, "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy that is not being considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from "in person directors" and "specialists" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of shares in water-supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour Government could impose "retentions" on the basis of the infringements found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers into the boards of companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking to "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has slowed down his final vote of nomination for the Supreme Court with at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of the Bureau could force some of the senators from the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60-minute correspondent" Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more honest than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident after that claim came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavanaugh and to change it, it requires a shaking charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rebuked it firmly," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasius Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: the elimination of poverty around the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big morava in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but will also get to know the real purpose of the event – the elimination of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as voluntary participation, sending no email to a global leader, calling on the phone or connecting in another way to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen 12 years before achieving his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to demand action or is it simply another case of so-called "clitiquism" – people think they are doing something important when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who insist on a number of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions as already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, commitment to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35m to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4700 posts on Twitter by global citizens have been received.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice to malnutrition simply into a historical note," said Ambassador of "The Strength of Nutrition" Tracy Ulman to the audience of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken that call on Britain to improve the feeding of mothers and children, the government has reported on financing a project, the "Food Force", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CZVs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But just as in the great movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Sean Mendez, Cardi B., Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborah Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use naval forces to "block" and hinder energy exports - the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zink quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the event, organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is presented as the "power consumer voice" in the US.
He sought to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuels," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as "one-number ponies", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with strengthening exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, turns Berlin into a hostage.
Moscow has stressed several times that the $11 billion pipeline of North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is purely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the point of view, energy cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of the German Industry (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the presidential candidate in 2020, says the senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "look seriously" at the presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During the City Council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his assessment of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "administered this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was honest in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The sociological study showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent for and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed with regard to potential candidateing in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed PTSD to Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the entry in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with," she told the audience at a rally on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and told his son and other veterans of the war that "they are returning a little bit changed, hardened, returning and wondering if they will receive this respect that they and their brothers have given the country in arms."
He was arrested in Vasila, Alaska on Monday and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, a report on domestic violence and weapons possession in an unsuspecting state, according to Dan Bennett, spokeswoman for Vasila's police administration.
18 states and districts of Colombia support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Colombia support the US's legal challenge to a new policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the district applied for good will in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging politics, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the claimant in the Grace vs. Sessions case was not revealed, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang members" mistreated her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. attorneys helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom come from the United States of America as nations facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned the decision of the 2014 Immigrants' Board of Appeal, which has allowed immigrants to apply for asylum to document fleeing domestic violence.
Columbia County lawyer Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle," the report of goodwill said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that a policy that refuses the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary working hand".
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in immigration cases to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic harassment and gang violence.
"A refuge is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political beliefs," Sessions said in his message of 11 July on politics.
The haven was never meant to relieve all problems – not all of them serious – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while deaths double during search of survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded possessions.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake with a magnet of 7.5 are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were placed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to continuing secondary shocks.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the fierce earthquake in the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into a broken wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China in "torture" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official newspaper in China placed a four-page ad in the US daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's indictment that Pecky was trying to interfere with the US Congress elections noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to play commercial promotion ads, at the moment Beijing and Washington are taking part in an escalating trade war in which import tariffs are equalised between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in the country such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a commentary in the Sunday number of Des Moines Register, "at present he doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads into our own free press."
"In disseminating his propaganda, the government of China took advantage of the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and the press by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, at a newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have in relation to China's alarming economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist party," he wrote.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh's mob, Republicans repel women's voters for the mid-term elections, analysts warn
As many high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the Supreme Court nominations of Brett Kavanaugh with regard to several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, in particular from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the pan are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," Grant Raher, a political professor at Maxwell University in Syracuse, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether insistence at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in an FBI investigation would be sufficient to appease angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Gene-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandald "Noemvri is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasius Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rottenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among the voters of women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominations, analysts suggest she may follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is put on the stand. It is about the way the Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group helping to elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But the Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little bit more prone to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the responders definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her in an unsettled state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee begins a venture aimed at competing on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend in the field of technology, the company that builds the open source platform of Burners-Lei Solid.
Solid allows consumers to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lei, it is a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said in terms of the initiative.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or Pod.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all of them simultaneously.
The unique thing about the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "the granting of personal data powers."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralisation applications using tools available on Inrupt's website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely renewed overnight.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Ley wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had a strong impact on the network's neutrality debate.
Although Inrupt has started, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: In memory of a priest awarded with the cross Victoria during World War I
They are marked for 100 years in the hometown of the only English priest awarded with the cross Victoria for his participation in combat activities during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaukourt attacks.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without knowing that he was honored with Britain's highest military honors.
A memorial monument was found on Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Ruschden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the monument to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal case.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
Later he attacked the fire line and with "incredible courage" led ahead before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were “a thing I know I could never do, but it makes me feel humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it is "a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine you wait all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot witness the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six of the main cards and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6pm, just when Gegard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the British viewers remained stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
A fan described on Twitter the switch of the child's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme was changed by children's broadcast," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa Pig," yeah."
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said they would work on planning meetings to include British viewers in the future.
"According to me, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"But there is six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that. He was government.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to provide ourselves more to the fans, but we overdid it.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care less about winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent leader of the long-time show, Curtis Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his participation in Laverne Daley's first programme, he said he felt "less" than everyone else while growing up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inadequacy and that I am different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – US director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was "surprised."
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than him last year, but claimed that age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he participated for the first time in the Olympic Games of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs."
They became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says that "his whole view" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told us that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there for me, Dad, or in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at the moment I knew he was dead, I finally admitted he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that my whole life I had dreamed of – jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no greater feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – who accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him tense.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Michaelson's lost form remains on the Ryder Bath stand on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Ryder Bath, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be tied to failure.
Mikelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the stand by Captain Jim Furik for "fourball" and "foursom" matches Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again on the US team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most legitimate players, is not in optimal form for Le Golf National's difficult playground, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the field itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth game of Sunday, Mikelson will face the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who is in a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 singles, make a strong start, it could prove that the Mickelson game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given as much in both the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how it happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Falldo's record for the highest match in Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in Ryder Bath, which has never drawn close to its impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by figures.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he's a great person for every team," he explained.
"I think that even younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead can soon be melted
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great front, accumulated before the single matches of the last day of the Ryder Bath, can be easily erased.
The Dutchman debuted in the match of "Valderrama" in 1997, when the team with Captain Seva Ballisteros led five points to the Americans, but right on the final right was almost reached and was barely able to hold the victory by 14 - 13.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage of "Valderrama"; we also had a big head start on Brookline, where we lost, and on "Valderrama" we won, but very hard," Bjorn said, after the team of Europe won 5-3 sessions in 2018 on Friday and yesterday, with which it led with 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So history has to show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I kept saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we are also aware of our rivals who are one of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush to the celebrations.
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
The individual performances will come out tomorrow, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you put your entire capacity as a golfer to the test.
This is the message you need to get to the players: tomorrow you have to do your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too must be given to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to introduce themselves better individually than as partners, with exceptions being only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these major reverses in the last day – he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans did "The Wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on Brookline, as well as on Medinah."
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these midterm matches are played under a lot of pressure.
That's why we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading our counterattack and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the greatest chance of success," Bjorn said of his choice for singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new battleship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 in order to replace the aged warships of the Cold War, but this will not be implemented until at least next year due to the faulty systems and the head-to-head growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading brand ship of new frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted the military spokesman as saying.
The floating court was to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates should be able to be used up to two years before returning to the ports of maturation.
However, continuous delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The accident frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of major "superficial and hardware defects" that make the military ship unusable if it is sent on a military mission.
Software disadvantages are particularly important, as the vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Fregates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has proved that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the possibility of the naval forces adding future superstructures.
The 7000-ton ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is considered to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including for crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's military forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet is in fact "exhausted by ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become larger in time as the old ships were derived from operation but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The national reed follows the secret life of bats
A new survey carried out in an estate in the Scots Mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
Hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study of scientists from the National Trieste of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as the brown dart watery nightgowns at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the bats' call sounds, as well as what types of bats they issue.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain generally decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities affecting their havens and leading to loss of habitats.
The risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Trieste has trained experts who conduct regular studies, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve at the Threave mansion in the Dumfries and Galaways, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson mansion says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a great field for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and completed a suitable habitat.
But there are many more things about bats that are unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to thrive."
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible for the accidental destruction of one asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as to destroy an entire local population.
The glues are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their havens.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee in the Trust to protect bats, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have much to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what happens to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, several hours after the announcements were published by 33-year-old Ronaldo swearing the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the Golden Ball carrier said in front of the camera five times.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get popular on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims called "an unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would claim compensation for "moral damage in size consistent with the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where she was said to have been raped anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District district court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the accident Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in the case he simply succumbed to the "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "revengeful" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is eager to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma to the incident in question.
At the time of the accident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Grand Juventus for 100m euros.
Breczit: UK “will regret forever” that it has lost car manufacturers
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its world leader status in the production of cars after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "unfortunate" that from Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bournaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the delay in the border in the Breckzit case without a deal could lead to loss of jobs.
Last year, around 150 000 cars were produced in the plant in Bournaston, where the Auris and Avensis models were produced, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain exits the EU at the end of March, the production of our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burundi.
Other car manufacturers from Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function.
BMWs, for example, say they'll close their Mini factory in Oxford in a month after Brexite.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the case of Breckzit without a deal.
Toyota's production line works on the ‘right on time’ principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both Britain and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which according to the industry could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the factory in Darbisher, the company said, and so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "shahmat" plan for a future relationship with the EU is "accurately calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in the program 4's Today on BBC Radio.
"After the allegations not only of Toyota, but of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
From Toyota they cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Bournaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I have tried to judge that if these jobs leave, they will never return.
The government spokeswoman said, "We have set out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein can be "scheduled by another week", as the candidate for the Supreme Court continues to fight Brett Cavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the D.A.'s deputy attorney, or not, thus jeopardizing Muller's independence, has been feeding rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, a meeting was announced with him Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing, which was witnessed both by Cavanaugh and by one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavanaugh, even further delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may not be a date yet, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be delayed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10th.
The lecturer Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences are not due to animosity to TV journalists' "demonstrative behaviour" although he said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behaviour."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has held several sessions with questions and answers from every president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you're witnessing to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences after you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking persons.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and momentarily strange behavior in front of his fellow journalists.
Health Minister addresses EU workers at the Scotland National Health Service as regards fears related to Brekzit
The health minister addressed in writing EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express the country's appreciation and desire to remain in place after Brekzit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter to stay for less than six months until Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the cost of establishing procedures for the status of EU citizens operating in decentralisationd public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, with decisions expected in this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure it's a very uncertain time for all of you.
I would therefore like to recall how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Collaterals from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers' Linebacker, Christian Abercrombi, suffered an emergency surgery after receiving head trauma during a meeting Saturday, when his team lost to venderbilt commodores by 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed shared with reporters that the trauma occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He went to the side line and somehow just fainted there," Reid said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercrombi oxygen to the side line before it was placed on a carrier and taken to the locker rooms for further examination.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details of the type/serious nature of the trauma, ” as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, second-grader with a college scholarship, is the first season in Tennessee State since his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blockades before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blockades for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher back account when buying real estate in the UK
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher back-up in the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The raise in the back account will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher back order in the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional revenues to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the back account will affect individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues supporting the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addendum to the current back account, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for the purpose of giving – may amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to 120 million British pounds annually.
About 13 percent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to an increase in prices and makes it difficult for those who buy their own property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "spiritual cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the back order to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by taking up land but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the allowances for affordable housing to fix "the disgrace with the housing" of Britain.
Mr Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control over rentals and the end of "no guilt".
He also wants to give the councils greater power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easily as those who work hard in Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the reluctance of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland team ”
Sonderland manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scot accepted the challenge of reviving the club from northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He went to Stadium of Light this summer after last season he took St. Miren back to the Scotland High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsund.
"But I grew up with the football games of the Hamptons, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This opportunity, however, would only be opened if I had success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moise, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
A former teacher of Aloa Atletik said he did not experience anxiety as an heir to such established names at a famous club, before he rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It will not be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumberton and 15 months at Harts' coaching headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miron from a falling team into a champion at Champianship in the next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really at the crossroads," he recalls when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best website for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player sometimes is hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my whole conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals the study
The summer heat has increased the incomes of struggling to survive British pubs, but has accumulated more tension for chains of restaurants.
Pub groups and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the business-consultant CGA, who composed the statistics, said: "Because of the prolonged solar time and longer since England's expected participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar model as in June, when the pubs reported an increase of 2.8 percent, but the restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline by 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their growth compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Pubs with food also suffered from the sun’s weather, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to come out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, liquor sales jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while there was a 3 per cent reduction in food."
Paul Newman, of the RSM’s rest and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we noticed in late April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although the decline in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the spread of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is an established indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides a secret profile from his parents in a social network
One in five children — some only 11 — has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Insta pages
News raises fears that material with sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" profile that shows their parents
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a profile in a social network that keeps a secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 students from secondary schools shows a rise in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "principal" profile, which shows their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who ran into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter who discovered a teenage child who encouraged others to "rape".
The study conducted by the Digital Aware UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keep their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Aileid Doyle will be “the voice of athletes ” in the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Aileid Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and President Ian Beaty has defined this move as a great opportunity for those leading to sports to take advantage of its rich experience at international level in the last decade.
"Elid enjoys great respect in the small athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly with its attraction," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the finals at 200 and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator in the BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I received a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm training for mobility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advert for breast milk pump, which compares mothers with cows, separates online opinions
The company producing breast-feeding pumps has divided online opinions by advertising, which compares breast-feeding mothers to cows who are breast-feeding.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected ‘first noiseless milk pump in the world suitable for wear’, the company for consumer technology Elvie has released the joking music-video advert to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the sucklers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's barn full of hay, in the background of a song with a text that includes: "Yes, I breast-feed, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not you, it's my breasts."
The song continues: “Purple, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, breast-feeding your friends. ”
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it degrades the milk processing industry's "treasures".
‘It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," wrote someone.
The Elvie breast-feeding pump is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is perfectly understandable that it is traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "So inadequate ad."
Others protected the ad, with a woman admitting that she considered the song “extremely fun. ”
"In my view, the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
The squeeze made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a bit of a joke, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," wrote someone.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertising aimed at mothers who are squeamish (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovered that they were dancing with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breast-feed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely noiseless, has no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in a breast-feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go outside while draining.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director in Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative placing on the market.
With the drawing of a parallel between sucklers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with this, while showing in a slow and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom, which will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump hits the top news.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Martha Yakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children are moved secretly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings on the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the acute rhetoric and politics by Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who are afraid to risk staying in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other family adults should provide fingerprints, with this data shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior employee at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or are members of the family of the guardians reside illegally in the country, many of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In an effort to cope quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not in person, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those identified as inappropriate to allow will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become suppressed or depressed, which may lead to violent flashes or attempts to escape, according to officials at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where the signs of a child having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “palatical city ” without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends may make it difficult for many to cope with the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey's "occupational troops" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for the eighth year.
Muallem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are staying illegally on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism and "they will be subject to the relevant actions".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been violently evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed" both by terrorist organisations and by "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who are mainly training and counseling both Kurdish parts and Syrians, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the land of the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions are tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western states that they are "breathing groundless fears" that drive refugees to stay away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be provided for the recovery of Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major fortress of rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-related al-Qaida front, which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "the review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no involvement.
Why Trump will win second term
According to this logic Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless – as many liberal viewers probably hope – his presidency will not be terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There are no signs of the killer's fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, the premium rating has increased twice to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate", where a cabinet secretary becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, who is a veteran comedy screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a cab in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her cab driver said he was voting for Mr. Trump.
She asked “Why? ”
Mrs. Scoul told me that he said, "Because it makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can be reunited, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this at six o’clock to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Streh"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of stauss leather for $15,000 (“a coat of arrogance” according to the “Washington Post”), and the shaking descriptions of Stommy Daniels about Mr Trump's anatomy.
I especially will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"It is an honor of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in terms of changing participants and daily turns (eating with the National Football League, lauding Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Fleece this week, it was sunny on the northern coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal committee, and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Fleece told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments in the most disputed race in Congress's early elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania gets a flow of money, thanks to the redecoration of Congress's districts and hence two holders for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in Pittsburgh's suburbs points to conservative Democrats Connor Lamb, who won his post from another district in the partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly up against the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were counter-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district broke up a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the broadly discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
The position was occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, and then withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the recent decisions no longer to be recognised by Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said earlier this month.
But sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received some 140 million US aid from America to fight drugs, with the aim of development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State with its unemployment rate and the percentage of the murders.
With internal meetings advanced, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves to continue such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from swimming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities stated that their wish was for the conference to take place, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens has announced that he will participate in a conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three US MPs quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report by Special Councilman Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If Congress's leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this authority, just when he is about to face his constituents, as well as perhaps to the jury of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not believe that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, as long as the West stood up to him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The walk of history depends on such knots, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding or slowing.
Right now, Americans are facing a few similar knots.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since that newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times story was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, would we vote in the Congress early elections if this would force Mr Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits her long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I took lessons from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for the Sabbath at that table, wearing a swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Brooks Institute, is president of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, realizing that winning the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G Group of the League of Europe.
The injury in the knee did not allow half-protector Graham Dorans to play his first game of the season before the 2-2 equation in question with Villareal, but he believed that for Rangers this result could become a tramplin to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old football player said.
"We entered the match in hopes that we could win something and leave with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
We've had a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened along with my contusions and club changes, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team's good and the boys are really having fun, the workouts are useful.
I hope we'll be able to harness all our strengths to forget last season and achieve the desired successes."
Women are worried about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study share that they discussed their husbands' costs in long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps towards having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector of Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Along with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Please include your financial adviser: your advisor may also help you with the idea of how to pay these costs.
Your solutions, when you choose a financial institution for long-term care, can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
You appoint a health care attorney so that you have a certain trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, it's about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
"What are the medicines like?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police describe the shooting that took place around 2:30 a.m. British summer time as "a random act".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Due to interrupted communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu, which is located near the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulavesi central, located at the end of a narrow beach border on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
It is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 km) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which is less than a province, was with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel's gain is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite shore of the Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami hit the west end of Dongala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Tichokean ring of fire” and is regularly cut by earthquakes.
Here are some of the big earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the western coast of Indonesia’s province of Aceh in North Sumatra activates a wave of tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people across the Indian Ocean’s coast, with more than half of them in Acech.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of the Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Truss with a magnetod 6.8 cut off the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed in the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake with a magnetod 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Earthquake with a magnetod 7.5 cut one of the islands of Mentawai and activated a 10-foot tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regent Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastations of the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, no tsunamis are activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes cut down the island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a stateless state.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son has been arrested for domestic violence charges.
Trak Paylin, former governor of Alaska's biggest son and candidate for Vice President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29, from Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in a notice of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by the US police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paylin is detained in the building for prior detention of Mat-Su and under an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certainly", when asked for a plea, the media reported.
Paylin is threatened with punishment for three Class A whores, which means he can be deprived of his freedom for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B hovel, which is being punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time Pailin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report on the alleged attack.
The case is currently being handled by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drug addicts in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Paylin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behaviour to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds died
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that cut the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
Earthquake with a magnetod 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks have been cut off, and the number of dead is expected to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavezi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
Social networks feature videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for a suspect in a New York terrorist assassination
New York's federal prosecutors want a death sentence for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist assassination, in which eight people died -- a rare death sentence that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is said that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a rental truck at Home Depot to carry out the assassination in October of the bike near West Side highway in lower Manhattan, gagging pedestrians and cyclists along his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily damage, according to a notice of intent regarding the death penalty application lodged in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an extended federal judicial team went to Saipov's 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with a racket used normally by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of the ICJ.
The attack required "serious planning and intent", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "terrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Habibulajevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Ernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last Southern New York area has been looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentences in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence in a federal case was executed in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekian by nationality, did not show a sense of remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police say.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecutor said.
He also asked for an IDIL flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a guilty and life sentence without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously wished the prosecution not to demand a death sentence.
A member of the conservatives' parliament says that Nigel Farage must lead the Brexite negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the conservators' conference.
The former leader of the British Party of Independence said politicians should "feel the pressure" - as one of Teresa May's own party members suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have been out by now" if Mr. Farage had been a secretary on the Breczit issues.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to address the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay that joined a separate protest against Breczit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by supporters Brekzit, supporters of the EU's stay as well.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between its package and chaos.
Mr. Bonn told the protesters with a slogan "Exit means exit" in Solihel that he wants to "refuse the Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage had to participate naturally with the others and that he had to receive the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The MEP from Wellingborough added: "I support Brexite, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
Saying his opposition attitude toward the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be hardworking.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The understanding that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is entirely false".
The conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us to be elected.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they were to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change to Breczit and we're gathered here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing the Breckzit, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has helped us to win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-rule, proud UK."
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a hike through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists were raising flags with "Conservators v. Breczit" inscriptions after the group was launched this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when he opened up at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and the entire technology of Canada and more, and more, for the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexite," he added.
Warren says he will "think seriously" his presidential bid
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would " seriously consider the opportunity to run for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against the state representative of the Republicans Jeff Dale, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the heart of speculation that it can take Trump's position in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holioke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall after Trump entered office.
One of her attendings asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was about time that "women go to Washington and fix our damaged government, and that includes women at the top."
He was arrested for the death of Simms from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested in Friday's shooting when basketball player Wade Simms of LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge's police department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man who shows up on the frames.
Simms, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson has been arrested without a problem and detained in the arrest of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A young man with a height of 6′6′′ who grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms took part in 32 matches with 10 outs last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches of the match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him beat Sebastian Fetel
Since the moment Walter Bottas ranks ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the directions from the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, allowing the Federation to attack its teammate.
The Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and went after the Fetel, but Hamilton managed to outrun it after bold maneuvering and driving a ‘gum to the tire’ which forced Ferrari's pilot with the unwillingness to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed the way of his opponent with a dangerous double protective maneuver on the third turn.
On my 21st birthday, Max Verstapen started from the back lines of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first tour.
Then he even ran through a rather long period of competition, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly outrun Kimmy Rykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the pit stop in the 44th tour, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight tours and eventually Rayconn finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Walter did a great job all weekend and he showed up as a real gentleman when he let me out of it.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for her claim that she had not spread the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, accusing the claimant for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a talk at rallyes in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and the beauty that's been happening in the Senate for the last few days when you see anger when you see angry people and evil people and disgusting, and unscrupulous," he said.
"When you look at editions and distributions, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know?
Diane Feinstein, did it spread out from you?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Cavanaugh as early as July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Financial denied that distribution had occurred from her office.
"I haven't covered up Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Financial told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep the confidentiality and I kept the confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the claimant for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president said that the Democrats are using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonor, the shame, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants · Global Voices
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Giants versus Dundy.
Dundy Stars is back on Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning a five-three rematch on Saturday.
Giants took him to a two-naked game early after he hit Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney evened out for the hosts before Duyer restored the front of the Giants.
Francois Bushar leveled for Dundy before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for the Adam Keef boys who got out of the bottom to defeat Dundy in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Rudderford doubled his advance by assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the help of the County at 15:16.
Duyer made sure the Giants took it before the first break, marking the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again leveled the odds with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
County and Charles Corcoran united efforts to help Nilsen give Dundy the lead for the first time this game at the end of the second half, and he did his best to confirm the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of a total of five meetings, welcome as hosts Milton Keens for their next match Friday.
The flight manager died to make sure hundreds of people on board the plane could escape from an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
Strong secondary shocks continued to hit the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at a highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, will manage to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
Later, he died in the hospital.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia Johannes Sirate said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," said the spokesman for Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aids and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There's maroades everywhere in the mini-marts."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was cut by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that a person is unknown after a plane crash in a lagoon
The plane that took the plane, which crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific, now reports that a person has been reported missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they could not contact a male passport from Saturday afternoon.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details on the passport, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped save passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the US naval forces said the plane had landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane has gone very low.
"This is extremely nice," Janes said.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to run through deep to the cross water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head trauma.
The U.S. naval forces say that sailors repairing a port nearby also helped in the rescue operation, using an inflatable boat to get people to the shore before the plane went down in the depths of about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have been killed on flights with aircraft registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
An analyst exhibits the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded with its case on this Saturday in the retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice has been testifying for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanford.
Sanford faced court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said she knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted text messages, calls and her contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is planned to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.

Another black man?!
A New Yorker sues a couple after firing a "racist" message
A New Yorker sues a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a misspelled message from the mother who complains that she is “the other black person. ”
The couple deny being racist, likening a claim of “extortion. ”
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was amazed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman felt uneasy, firing Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former nanny, who was an African-American, did not do her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a day's work then sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for firing, asking for the $350 a day for the six-month deal that she was originally hired for, even though she didn't have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do this," she told Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the termination of Morris's employment was a reasonable act, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," the husband, Joel Plasco, told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone whom you have offended even if it was wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Citing a request for “extortion, ” Plasco claims that his wife had only been born two months ago and was in a“ very difficult situation. ”
"Are you going to attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks by denying them their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's a lot of fun, since we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before inspired to write the children's book for a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about possible rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she described as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of his final success.
"He was a very modest man and was not a self-grateful person," she said.
"But since you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child that's achieved something: you're proud of him, although it's not really your case.
I think you kind of embraced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the merits of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation is really bad that she does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Edin-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say that he will die in two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
I told her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop acting and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to catch a cold."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who has been grieving for the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she is going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had bowed my head, and all the while my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this all-consuming sense of compassion with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Griefing women put up cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by smile.
They always said his smile brightens up every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving and was in “a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to let people know that there is someone to go to and who to talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not remain silent – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when children opened their gifts, he looked at them, and nothing."
She said that this was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must move on and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritans for free 116 123 (for Britain and Ireland), send an email to jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritans' website here.
Brett Cavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI begins an investigation.
I thought about whether we could really achieve what he wants - a limited-term investigation and a limited range - perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he is afraid that the committee is "decommissioning" despite the hard-line overpartial blockage.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
It's because of the moment.
Early elections are only five weeks from now, on November 6th – if Republicans are not expected to present themselves well, they will seriously suffer their attempts to elect their representative in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, invites them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and he's been able to meet his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea “decreases” in Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sugg, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were 1127 fugitives last year, and for comparison in 2011, they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts required by human trafficking are key factors.
There is no official comment on the part of China.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides the two roots.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, often being forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of state of the two countries met in China for talks focused on a stalemate in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused the United States of lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way that we will first unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "sterical" and said it was not appropriate for the Supreme Court to serve
The leader of the minority in Congress Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "asterious" and said he was too unbalanced for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I had no way of not thinking that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her "sterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected claims that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt like discussing his family and his student years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated attack on personality", organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was preconvinced of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and with the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when she was asked whether she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he is not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unable to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Right now Cavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that in her democratic capacity she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Law on Access to Health Care or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, preconvinced person to enter court and expect us to say, "Is it not great," Pelosi graduated.
And women need to be mastered.
It's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinum 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, but you?"
She continued, “I got huge help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who said that she too cried when she got angry, but developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her neighbor, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought that was genius."
Tears are allowed in the expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how, once upon a time, I was crying out of an inexplicable rage, older than I was, a woman grabbed my neck – a freezing manager, who I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship with a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well thought out solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it is late in the campaign, it is lagging behind in raising funds and decides it will not remain in the race unless it manages to raise $2 million.
The battle is predicated to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give 1,000 dollars to men, would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she says she will not continue with the official campaign, she is filled with so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and you can turn to voters, not delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would they write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the US and China were deafening and, while the battle is yet to pick up speed, a break between the two countries will bring Beijing's benefits in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning valve this year, betting on key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most escalating tension appeared this week with new duties affecting the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Every time Beijing returned with new bribes across the way with five to ten percent of US goods for 60 billion US dollars.
China has vowed to counter every US strike and soon it is not expected that the second largest global economy will ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to lower his head publicly in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for Si Jinpin, the president of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards right, pressure from the trade war with the United States can help in the long term China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have admitted before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate on issues related to Asia to the expert group, Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in the recovery of a country devastated by the war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem stressed that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in place is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastationed by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their diet.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance from countries that have funded the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins “Rider Bath” in Paris
The team of Europe won "Rider Cup" for 2018, overcoming the US team with a final score of 16.5 per 10.5 of Le Golf National in the Paris area, France.
Thus, the United States has had six consecutive losses on European land and has not won the Raider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Mikkelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented himself excellently in all round, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament that reached a balance of 5-0-0, since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Speight has lost precisely with 5&4 players on the team of Europe, located at the lowest in the rankings – Torbourne Olesen of Denmark.
World Ranger Dustin Johnson's leader lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, which is probably the last of Ryder's Baths.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in the Ryder Bath, became the European with the most won points in the tournament for all time, increasing its asset to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the bowl again.
All that matters is the team and I am happy to help," the excited Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He passed the baton to his countryman John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2 & 1 singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all of his four games in France and his overall balance of Ryder Bath is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 great titles – an indicator that only gives Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was having difficulties all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf all day in the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furik said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
At one time this morning we pushed the team of Europe.
There was a fight.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players presented themselves very well.
We'll regroup, discuss important issues with the American Professional Golfers' Association and our Ryder Bath Committee and look ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you won't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just outplayed."
New for red inflow: Concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manotti and Sarasota
The latest report by the Committee on Fish and Wildlife in Florida shows a general reduction in the concentrations of red inflows in sections of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there have been reports of growth gaps in the areas of Pinelas, Manotti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
The water sections with an excessive red inflow spread to approximately 130 miles along the coast, from the northern district of Pinelas to the southern district of Lee.
Seaweed sections can be seen 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough, but they are less than last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or slightly deeper in Pinelas County, low to high concentrations on the coast of the Hillsborough, high concentration assumptions in the Manotti County, high concentrations on the coast or within the Sarasota County, moderate concentration assumptions in Charlotte County, high concentration assumptions in the coast or deeper in the district of Lee, and low concentrations in the Collier County.
Reports of inflammation of the airways in Pinelas, Manoti, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts continue.
No reports of respiratory tract inflammation in Northwestern Florida were received last week.
