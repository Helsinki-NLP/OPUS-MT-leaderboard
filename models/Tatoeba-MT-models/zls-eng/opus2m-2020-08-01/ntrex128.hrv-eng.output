Welsh parliamentary deputies worry that they'll "look like Muppets"
Some Assembly MPs (Assembly Member, AM) were startled by the suggestion that they might be called representatives of the Welsh Parliament, MWP in the future.
This was due to plans for the parliament to be renamed to the Welsh parliament.
Parliamentary representatives from all political spectrum are concerned that they might become subject to ridicule.
A Labour Party parliamentary representative said his group is concerned that the term "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on the Welsh twp means dumb, and pwp shit.
A parliamentary representative from the Walles Party (Welsh. Plaid Cymru) said the group was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word “w” is pronounced similar to that of the letter “u” in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on how parliamentarians will be appointed on their own."
In 2017, the Law of the Government of Wales gave the Welsh Assembly authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that met with broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what MPs will be called in the assembly, the Committee was prone to the term "members of the Welsh Parliament" or the MWP, but the MWP option was given the highest support during the public consultation.
Parliamentary MPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speakers Elin Jones who are expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the parliaments function, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentary deputies will have a decisive vote on what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing country name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents the ownership of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise a referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is a simple price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
They silenced the bells of St. Martin as the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I talked to said there could be a bar and a church on every corner in the past," Mr. Adams said.
"There's none of them today."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People are friends today in another way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people live regularly."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as church leaders think "at first or later it will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "they will therefore come faster the day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that residents who move into those apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white aggregates before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that maintained services nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church took over the black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the head who led and boycotted retailers on 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of poor men. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July used a second term: "cultural treasure" and "non-replaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing at a larger carillon in Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of whom have been brought by layian church leaders and other episcopal children.
Sakristija, the managing body of a layman's parish, wrote in July about the concern that the diet would "try to transfer the costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the involvement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the student.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the side of a diet.
Shark injured 13-year-olds while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then with the group he rowed to the scene of the attack to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was excitement about the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy he noticed that his whole clavicle had been torn apart.
"I got all worked up to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper body.
Authorities closed their access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct an investigation and safety of buyers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of department stores and by hiring specialized sellers.
As part of the major entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow in comparison with the decline in sales of clothing and equipment for home, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 shops across the country and extended to additional shops next year if they show success.
Investment in cosmetic products is one way that supermarkets try to use the space on shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Representatives of Sainsbury’s said they would double the size of cosmetic products offers on 3000 products, including first time trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing L’Oreal company, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will receive more space from areas for certain brands similar to shops such as Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its aortaman decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will trially use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one that opens in Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, head director of Sainsbury’s, said that outlets will look more and more like department stores while the supermarket chain seeks to resist favourable shops such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlets of Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, which he claimed encouraged the sale of live supplies and made these acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended with a fight over the distribution of income from pharmacy in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold his pharmaceutical job in 281 Store Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy.
He claims Lloyds will play a role in the plan by putting into four stores a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our departments with cosmetic products to give our users a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in special training colleagues who will be hand in hand to customers and give them advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changing old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "breathed" after Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million-pound contract
Dragon Star’s Dan Peter Jones left to “boil out of rage” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new trade chains Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
Their brand was compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragon’s Den Peter Jones to cook with anger by last minute withdrawing from a joint profitable job to focus on her new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "breathed" when the golden girl television during a tense meeting Tuesday at his Marlow business empire in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant that there was no longer enough time to devote to their home clothes brand and fashion accessories, Truly.
This job was compared to the brand of Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have secured it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was startled by everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday so close to starting the entire line.
At Marlowe headquarters, the warehouse is full of goods that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in the products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes and possible additional delays in line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capp, and Jones (52) joined them as chairman of the administration in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as Head of ITV's I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Heavy negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the paper for comments some might consider "unworthy presidents" and for having such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump make so many concessions?"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news leader.
"I haven't made any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly world leaders that the north had not noticed a "responsible reaction" to the US' disarmament activities in North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States still has not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stand in his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"He threatened us with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would get hurt.
We have a great relationship now."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the suspension of test rockets, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people to enter this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly ahead of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after an earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said not to be necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is all a bit problematic," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Sava the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Catastrophe Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palou to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
In view of the continuing earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared for carrying on with the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of a warning siren at a tsunami in Palua, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at best, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters further make logistics more difficult.
The ship's hospital that was anchored in Lombok to take care of the earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesian decomposed structures was the cornerstone of President Yoko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are being held next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets of machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge score for equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeating the Premier League game against Chelsea by hitting 89 minutes at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal in a 1:0 score for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before kicking it towards the opposite pole.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fled to Kepaya Arrizabalaya, who jumped toward her and entered the network.
"It was demanding to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told Liverpool.com
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea was half-timed with 1:0 after the hit by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The shooter passed the ball back to Mate Kovačić during that game before turning somewhere in half the field and running into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
He then directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazarda to the goal.
Hazzard went around the defense and hit the ball in the net with his left foot on the opposite pole next to Liverpool goalie Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Napoli in the Champions' League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3:00 Thursday in London.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has increased to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832, the state disaster office announced on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency said at a press conference that it was reported that a large number of people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5 Magnitude earthquake that felt on Friday and caused waves of up to 6m high.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police invited people from the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is at the beginning, but I would like everyone near John Street to address us in Birkenhead, and they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found by a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police say the notification process is ongoing and is the closest to the victim's family.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Meows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told it will take several hours until they can return to their apartments.
The officer allegedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 in the fenced area were two police vans, and another was parked right outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the housing block.
All those who have any information have been asked to send a direct message to @MerPollCC, named 101, or anonymously address Crimestoppers' number 0800 555 111, calling for minutes 247 since 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of a debate on "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for nearly Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "trying to end history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate that is currently being held regarding the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
Ikonoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful life of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way of thinking in the 19th century and part of the history of a person many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to the defenders of parliament against external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Is this a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historic debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord of Protectors are still worthy of honors and markings."
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs were attacked and killed by a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead cut arteries and covered in blood near a stand at a market in Lipanshui in the province of Guizhou, Jutarni list of southern China announced on Sunday.
The pig grower was preparing to vaccinate pigs in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos bit the breeder to death.
The evening news of Guyang states that a cousin named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and maimed."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 0440 Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje news that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her wife on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig moved a Welsh farmer along a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs were eaten by a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They are just playful.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show them respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As announced, hurricane Rosa is weak as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
During the following days, however, Rosa will bring flood rains in the North Mexican and South-West United States.
At 5:00 Eastern time Rosa blew at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and it was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, a low pressure area is being created and is moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Bay of California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture in the north-west direction of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250mm rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy rainfall in the large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, mudslides and possible desert slides.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be noise floods, with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunder showers will bring local storms and dusty breezes.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
Possible precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which can cause less muddy streams and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning before covering the wider area at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the area where the borders of the state of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are being touched on Tuesday and last all day Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the United States are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes it leads to dramatic changes in temperature at low distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, lagging summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
The start of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast in most of the Central and Eastern United States.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great opportunity above average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching six television networks Thursday to test the candidates for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political fighting continued, and reporters interrupted a regular programme to inform the turnaround at the last minute of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that he was absolutely sure Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a bitter testimony that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
Friday's hearing likely followed more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing was not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties measuring the number of people who watch the content in the offices.
To give you a better story, it's about an audience that's a lot like the one watching American football play or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The profession remained large even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS's cameras on Friday morning, they recorded him being called by protesters while trying to take the elevator to the Justice Committee's hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes down while he was showered in front of CNN's cameras live by the protesters.
"I am standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him: "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement before the elevator door closed that they would say more at the committee hearing.
Hours later, all the cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the candidates next week, as required by the minorities who are in the minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened up an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her EU exit plan of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview with her on the cover, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs fees "complete stupidity".
Wade Sims' murder: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of LSU's death
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of homicide from the country, police department of Baton Rouge said.
Officials posted a video of Sims and Simpson's conflict, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, a CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
A $350,000 bail has been requested.
The East Baton Rouge municipality's coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police administration thanks the task force for the fugitives of the federal state police of Louisiana, the federal police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for implementing the law on "sustainability and search for truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The lap player, six feet tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "dangerous" and "in shock" over Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Vulcan casts ashes on Mexico City
The ash that casts out the volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple tumbling and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreen cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of volcanoes located 72km southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake in 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police conflict and Catalan separatists meet anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocate independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the anti-demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarising secession vote.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began throwing eggs and powdered paint at police officers, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights broke out later on during the day the police used batons to calm the fight.
During several hours, the independent group ran "No forget, no forgiveness" against them, and the Unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that seek independence have not been quieted for a year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared against the law, which the Catalans are celebrating.
A large majority of voters opted for independence although turnout was low because those against secession mainly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year after police tried to stop holding votes in polling stations throughout the region.
The independent groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
"We experienced one of the best times last year.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, although a close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence have been able to hold momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in self-intentioned exile or in custody awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was triggered by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been investigating the prison since the end of last year, announced he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way we can declare the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after driving a car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car crashed several times into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballinagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, an arrow fired from the crossbow was fired on the car.
Menge score brought Livingston victory over the Rangers with score 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston brought victory
The new club of the Scottish Premiership League of Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to confess his only second defeat of the eighteen matches at the club's head from Ibrox Stadium.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive until Gary Holt's team settled in with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a victory in guests at the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading league club with eight points behind it.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Club as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still hasn't suffered defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they got that shot, since their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson got through, but he was too slow on his way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head against the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers dance in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for the guests.
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free shot, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisted Menga who hit the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers had mostly control over the ball, but they faced impenetrable domestic defenses, so goalie Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
It continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
The legs of goalie Rangers Allan McGregor were in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow put a broad blow from another organized attack on Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross the Livingston goal line, and two 11-year-olds were not convicted – after Halkett's conflict with substitute player Glen Middleton and one for hand-to-hand play.
"Great" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdar Lamont of the Scottish BBC in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed the expectations on that entry path.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since their return to large clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worral have any rest during the entire game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, only once they opened a hole in the home team, and it's a kind of invitation to run for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They differed in opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey lives in the city.
Police have blocked a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of presidential supporters have come to see him have appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protesters from the rival Erdogan -- a large number of Kurds -- voiced their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and German government's decisions to welcome him with a welcome welcome in the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as autocrats.
Road collision in Deptford: cyclist fatally killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on a road with a dense traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the getaway driver from the crash site on Chiders Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify a man and inform his closest relatives.
Due to the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic has been rerouted, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Hurt in Riots · Global Voices
The prison department said six police officers were injured in riots in a man's prison.
The riots broke out in Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Special Tornado troops have been brought in to combat riots involving eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were provided assistance due to minor injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been engaged to resolve the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clearly want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be committed to the police and that they could spend a long time behind bars."
In Long Lartin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the warden of the prison ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called into prison to address a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (possibly useful for dry areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that it will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa, with the remaining power, crosses the Desert Southwest and brings danger to the floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings about the lush floods Monday and Tuesday in the area of western Arizona, via southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with rain and cross it right over on Tuesday.
In her tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix stated that since 1950, “only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a depression within a 200 - mile [320 km] radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre foresees 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with an isolated amount of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including Stjenjak and the Great Pool, there is a probability of rainfall from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated totals of up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from the floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, part of these rainfalls could be beneficial because the current drought is in the southwest.
"According to the American map of dry areas, a little over 40% of Arizona has been affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category,"weather.com said.
The hurricane's journey first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Bai California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane power with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm encountered colder Pacific waters and therefore weakened.
Thus, on Monday afternoon or evening, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico with the force of a tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to floods.
"The amount of total rainfall expected in the area from the Bay of California peninsula to the northwest Sonora is between 75 and 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and in southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is the very heavy rain on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricanes Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and floods of mud in the deserts and glids on the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday.
He's been taken to the hospital, and he's stable.
Avon and Somerset's police administration said 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called for anyone who has a recording of the event.
Trump claims Kavanaugh has suffered the wickedness and rage of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered malice and anger" by the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday in front of Congress and resolutely and emotionally dismissed the charges of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual assault tens of years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the indictment she filed.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service," he said to gathered supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of the republican vote in the half of the presidential term.
"Five weeks divides us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is to "make resistance and obstructions".
A Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the Senate's first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were dragged by huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pal on Friday when at dusk waves of up to six metres high hit the coast, dragging many of them to their deaths and destroying everyone on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the consequences of the BPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he pulled cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent blows continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
In her statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake corresponded to twice the nuclear power dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damages may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," says a Red Cross statement adding that staff and volunteers were headed to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms over the lack of information that the tsunami hit Pala, though officials claim the waves came as soon as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of a building panicfully warns people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall fell to the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused the power to go out of control, causing a failure of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, it has begun to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palou on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has taken more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision from Donggala have arrived successfully in the town of Palu, where employees are sheltered in Tarpaulin tents placed in the courtyard of their office, they have passed the scenes of destruction on their way," Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palo.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "Okay, it's a national disaster" we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Pal on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that alleviate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paraglider community, whatsApp was desperately sending to the Palu competitions who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away 26.750 U.S. dollars while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 U.S. dollars from Brink's employees who were filling an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement said that the car driver was emptying an ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man "came behind the back of Brink's employee in the race" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not list the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In Saturday's post on Twitter, in which he announced the change, he wrote: "The living being is officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of its eighth album published in June.
Change comes ahead of his tour on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The show's authors said it replaced the singer Ariana Grande who canceled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being a shortcut to his current artistic name, the West has earlier stated that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”, West said earlier this year in a conversation on the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, meaning “only” in Ye alone – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's the one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And a former West associate, Jay-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a cartoon and with a cartoon and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's candidate promised he would never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday to "never use the army against the Mexican people".
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations at the square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people at the time the leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those who study and by opening up a number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Because China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in this area," said an artificial intelligence investor and an expert in this area, Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans regarding artificial intelligence, although the United States generally lacks a formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year: it aims to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"Double increase in the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Double increase in investment could double the chance that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the United States," Lee said this week in a conversation with the NBC.
Lee whose book: “AI Great Force: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, head of the company Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on the AI system that beat the best American player Othello, and later he was the director of Microsoft's research department and the president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee praised the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked the question when will be held next to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It is not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think doctorates in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced a plan for the development of the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions similar to that of the National Science Foundation and other state organisations providing financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose was to include partners in the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Saturday to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and has led Greece to block the opening of accession negotiations with the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province named Macedonia and Greece argues that its northern neighbour's name represents the ownership of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The issue on the referendum ballot said: "Are you for NATO and EU membership while agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to allow access to bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that were created after Yugoslavia's collapse, to be joined.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough parliament members said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, it is our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined the country's name change referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018, which would pave the way for NATO's accession to the Union and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje and received chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will make so much needed investments in Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research last Monday shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, below the required response.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defense to score a hit.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday, England, and won the Manchester City victory with a score of 2:0.
Aguero's victory made it crazy simple, getting hit in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean attacker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three of Brighton's defense players and then made it to the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four rival players in green shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders, then overtook a few others on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English gunman from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero, who put the right digging ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some problems with his foot," Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola briefed reporters.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the face of the Premier League.
That hit was made in 29 minutes.
During that game, Aguero won the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He's wonderfully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before he led Sterling to the stand.
The Sky Blues shooter threw the ball into the net just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City fights the Hoffenheim in the Champions' League's team game Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Germany's Synsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the progress of Rockies
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always a competing Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, come to playoffs.
On Friday night, the Rockies won 5:2 over the Nationals at least secured a place in the Wild-card playoffs, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce Sunday's starter, but they're reportedly willing to offer Scherzer a game.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher room Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-handed man in this season achieved a score of 18:7, an average of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters' turnout in the general elections, the president commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge.
"All we have done will be tested in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control; that's why they want power and control; we won't give them."
The Democrats, he says, have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You have seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the angry, the evil, the corrupt and the lying".
He praised democratic senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee by name, causing a loud disdain for the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document. It was really a bad body speech, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
It does not tolerate personal attitudes
It didn't surprise me too much when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour Party deputies who have been said not to be welcome – and all because of what we have said in mind.
According to my fellow MPs, Joan Ryan acted similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticised in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbin disagreed with the previous leadership.
On Friday's announcement of a meeting of the Labour Party's branch in Nottingham East, it was noted that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as the local representative of the Labour Party's meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings have passed in a different tone nowadays, and the promise of a "friendly, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is estimated on the basis of whether they are acceptable to party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as the associates I thought were sharing similar political opinions began to demand a drastic change of opinion and taking views I would never agree with - whether it was a national security or an EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there is a series of offensive words on social networks calling for my impeachment, which deny the policies of the centre and tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I've received are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has most disappointed me is tolerating offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal on mistrust or change of electoral rules, we become an increasingly small party.
Many times in the last two years, I've been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and tell me that then everything will be all right."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school multi-purpose classroom to fail, I wanted to provide better public services for those most in need – either as a local councilman or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been led astray about my political views and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment the country grabs at Brexit that will negatively reflect on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituency, whether it's about members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political benefit will distract me from acting the way I think it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heading toward the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day at the Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated of ten teams.
Finally, the ultimate defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tried at every game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, "Each honour to Ayru, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to raise the results, and Jason Baggott took the unrealised attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership to the eleventh before, at halftime, scored and realised an independent attempt to change the score for Ayr at 17:5 before the break.
But Melrose's second half started out well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggott, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then came the long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott that they took on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued to play a good game by trying Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, and this unrealised attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow crash card Clima which had no ball; with the penalty line, MacPherson performed the lay behind Ayra in the full swing of the breach.
Climo realized that he was doing it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took a high blow from David Armstrong and sent a side player, Gregor Henry, on the fifth attempt by the home team.
The Star of Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, star of Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service activities after being discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC show whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
The Djac announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to appear, and it seems Kiernan plans to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in "a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will grant it an exit to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the sea center of a crowded crane in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color has been reported on public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have wings: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in the favor of Chile during the conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just like the longing for the re-seaing of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting an International Court of Justice ruling expected on October 1st, after a five-year trial, hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A crowd of Bolivians across the country will see the International Court of Justice verdict on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice ruling comes only six months after the final hearings means that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting the interest of Bolivia, the last four years may have reversed them.
"The issue of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made an unusually fast decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "interrupt 139 years of disagreement with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the favorite presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political crutches.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"A verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to get through the past."
North Korea says there won't be nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm unless they could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the day's promises during the meeting of leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
Commentaries were referred to at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared prone to restart diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions continued because of "destined imaginations" and that US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will by no means cast the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to disown the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show reveals that the last line of big head coverings is on the way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely cover the sun, don't look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the runway presented a line of loose-boiled giant head coverings for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and thrilled the fans of style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have been swept by Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that draw attention to the runway.
The example that stood out was Valentino, and it was a large beige hat decorated with a wide ring like feathers that had completely taken over the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but these accessories are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with a melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
Styleists predict that huge hats could come to a luxury store in your neighborhood.
The huge hats perfectly fit with the heels “La Bomb”, a straw hat with a ring about 60 cm wide that was seen on many celebrities, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind an extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks on the runway sent another great creation – a straw bag for the beach almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
Exhausted orange bag of raffia, decorated with raffia bars and white leather lunch, was an exhibition in the summer collection Jacqeumus' La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags in luxury shops for next summer. Since the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories."
John Edward: The language skills that citizens of the world need
The Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary exams, with additional weight giving individual and joint successes in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them to the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above mentioned school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject of school selection.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest grades in languages have been achieved by independent school students.
A total of 68% of foreign language students received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 schools of SCIS members show that 72% of students received an excellent assessment for the Mandarin language, while 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of Spanish learners also received the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young ones will certainly need in the future.
Today languages are considered as electoral subjects as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill their jobs due to lack of labour with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of youth for careers.
Since language skills are being sought at more and more jobs, they are crucial in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak foreign language in the future will experience the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can directly communicate with foreigners, and this gives her an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov involving more than 4000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks the two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
So investment in language learning is very important for children today.
If children learn more languages, especially languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, each school offers various languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages considered to be most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a wide range of choices, as well as teaching staff that is professional in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which learners will prepare and arm the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future holds for us.
It cannot be ignored that in today’s business, language knowledge is very important for the future of each country so that it must also be reflected in education.
Hence, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be viewed as “the international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will be the first time in Lakers' uniform in San Diego on Sunday
The fans will soon welcome the first performance of LeBron James for the Lakers of Los Angeles.
The Laker coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the official Lakers page.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in the Lakers that consist of six games.
"I really don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most of the congress after the November vote.
What time begins tonight's Trump rally in West Virginia, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be viewed online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who have caused controversy over sexual harassment charges.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans gain the upper hand in the November elections.
Therefore, Trump's campaign headquarters reports that five meetings scheduled for next week aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", Reuters reported.
"Most of them in Congress are so important to the president's plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible as possible as we enter a tumultuous campaign," Reuters anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's gathering in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohi and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. In 2016 he won by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help a Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve the ranking in the polls," Politologist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team left its heart on the ground before individual clashes on Sunday
After three one-sided couples' match on Sunday afternoon, maybe it's exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to turn.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a saying that is particularly true in sports and which athletes believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
Who is the wheel of happiness now favored?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead of four points, while there are 12 points left to go.
Spieth says that the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouraged his game with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the whole day's game.
Spieth played killerly from Tee to Green and could serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading cry became louder and louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth came to an unsolved result.
A similar cheerleading spell followed the way he won the game with 15 holes that could identify hope and faith that Americans could turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
Those players are the only ones left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of Ryder Cup.
A European strange but irresistible couple has a maximum number of points and can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back ninjas Friday morning.
The winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that they are just the players to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of Europeans as the sun sets over Paris' Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time in different holes.
Yet it is too early to talk about the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took out Alex Noren and Sergi Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the playground buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't dig out of.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their holes.
It's fascinating to watch couples' games up close because you can see players' interactions in pairs, hear the advice they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can change in a moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary struggle, in which some, in particular, Stateside, suspected.
Europeans on the last day Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10:6
After Saturday's couples' games on the last day of Ryder Cup, Europeans enter with a significant advantage over the United States of America of 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy she escaped in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in couples, achieving a score of 3 : 1.
The American team has shown greater fighting in couples by winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
To win the team's trophy, Jim Furyk should collect eight points in the 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debuter from the European team to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Mollywood", after a sensational weekend only the second pair to win four points in the game in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they proved themselves superior in the game against Woods and US debutante Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5/4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games made some brilliant moves, but now there are 19 losses of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused his morning fourballs to get back in the game with his partner, Henry Stanson, and suffered a 2 & 1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
But the Europeans did not go all smooth during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting the scale high for their American team.
First, they defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2 & 1 in fourballs, and after that, they defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4 & 3 in pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice in all history, Ryder Cupa team, which was four points behind, managed to return to individual games, although Furyk's team only needs an unsolved score to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, Sunday's counter-attack seems to be hard on them.
North Korea declares "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that further sanctions would increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no way North Korea would unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea last year took "significant measures of goodwill", for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, disarmed a nuclear test station and made a decision to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we did not get a satisfactory reaction from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security either, under such circumstances there's no way we're going to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's resistance to "progressive" denuclearisation within which the sanctions would gradually be lifted in North Korea, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work on the "denucularisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end a Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned that Pyongyang give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction in strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The US insists that a denuclearisation be carried out before that and increase pressure by means of sanctions in order to force its goal, and even oppose the "end of war declaration", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is only a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for a second meeting of Kim and Trump that the president of the United States talked about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister stressed that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearisation had been sought by South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have taken place like this."
Whatever the case, the tone of speech of Minister Rie differed greatly from that of last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental U.S. rockets was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim "a man's rocket" on a suicidal mission.
Trump, who last year threatened "complete destruction" of North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that they still have a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea carries out denuclearisation.
Trump said on Wednesday there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have voiced the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an effort to halt the financing of a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio in the UN's main assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress was made, but North Korea called him after several hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has set up a meeting with Moon this month to demonstrate a missile location and a nuclear complex that will happen if the United States takes "responsible measures".
He added that Kim revealed to him that these "responsible measures" refer to security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course where they learn how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to fight an ever-expanded learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea of the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes to be the first of those species in the United States.
The idea of the course came after giving a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I know this only now, in my last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services Paul Barreira says the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a dormitory where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis shoes and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how the lack of sleep affects success and how important sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a map of campuses with interactive icons encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride on all-night learning before the exams continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
The professor says that secret weapons of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleep also helps to fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, inserts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry student and biology student in California, helped Professor Czeisler develop a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand his course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn the alarm on during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that air screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadialic rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goals defeated Gerard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the Dolly Menge hit the missing defense of Steven Gerrard and ended the game by winning Livingston with a score of 1-0.
The guys from Ibrox wanted to win the first victory in the feast after the triumph in February and results 4 :1 at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team is now eight points behind in Ladbrokes Premiership after the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to have run out of inspiration and didn't seem to equalize the score.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one shot of the difference behind Hibernian.
There may be new problems for the Rangers after Line Judge Calum Spence received a head injury when a case was thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight shifts on his hips, so he smuggled past Ayr to the Bethfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same setup of Livingston that the Hearts last week took a measure and would be thrilled that his well-designed setup choked every attempt by an opponent.
The Rangers may have had more of the ball in possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They had had a chance to hit for two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game that opened Scott Pittman's space to head towards Allan McGregor's goal, however, the vesicle missed that opportunity.
The deep free blow of Keaghan Jacobs was met by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense teammate Alan Lithgow could only forward an imprecise blow to the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game seemed to play with hope instead of belief.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that the judge should have given him 11 in 15 minutes after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not respect Colombian's request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to make only two goals to the goal, but the former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly was one blow to the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the pitted blow of Ovie Eyaria was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playoff of Livingston slowed down the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers have again failed to use the deep Jacobs' return ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his character and chose Menga to simply end the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his own line.
But Livingston continued to involve visitors in exactly the game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett scored one long blow after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide leap out of the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an 11-year-old because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away this time too.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now here comes a page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and several days ago ...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has also become the main foothold of pop culture, for example in the 1950 Bells of Colorado, where the main roles were seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this, for God's sake?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms that react to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But an invention bearing his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory
Cells are treated to be able to "recognise" protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injection into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient, their changes in the laboratory so that they can "recognise" protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer and re-injection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in the state of Bethesda in the state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and learning them how to identify cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the debate on Trump and supported it after visiting Saturday Night Live, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's Make America Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was screened in a study during Saturday Night Live after a show of interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat titled "Let's make America big again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the US Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey's sexual abuse claims.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was transmitted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
There's no telling if the publication of Rock was trying to mock West.
Also, the West complained to the public that they were throwing him behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"I was harassed behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been bullied!
They said I went down," said Washington Examiner.
The West continued, "You want to see the bottom?", and he said he'd wear his Superman cloak because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments at least twice caused public disfavor, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person told the magazine, "The whole studio has been quieted down."
West was invited at the last moment as a substitute for a singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
By performing the song "I love it", dressed as a bottle of mineral water Perrier, he astounded many.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the people with the bravest spirit: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia."
But show host Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that the West was simply "it was its own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or by supporting his "art") for whom I believe he accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, who is also known by the names Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lyon, and of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed her name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
A charge of attempted murder with a knife in a Belfast restaurant

The star of the series Game of Thrones Kit Harrington is facing toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow who handles sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But a 31-year-old actor went for a stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such TV roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to gain respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old counterpart Rose Leslie of the Game of Thrones, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" to face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this point – where have we sinned with masculinity?" he asked.
"What did we teach men as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male characters on screens, could partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, and boys feel that they have to have these certain lines of men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
'Cause obviously, for the boys, something went wrong.'
In his interview, he also admitted that he would not record the sequels of the Game of Thrones after its completion next summer and said he had "ending up with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will be performing a new performance by True West author Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him during the shooting of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife by filming that show, which gave me a family and a future life," he discovered.
Rose, in a fantastic show that won the emmy award, played the role of Ygritte, the love of the whale character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that by 14% the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased.
Healthcare professionals say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV has been transported rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, the Chinese health authorities said that the HIV infected person is almost gone in this way.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV virus to sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination is said to be large.
Studies estimate that 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman because of their conservative values in the country.
Many cases of disease transfer in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of its efforts to deal with the problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public has submitted information on the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US representative Maxine Walters denied on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal data from three Republican American senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The L.A. Democratic representative assures that these claims are spread by individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as websites.
"He lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network Thursday and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate over allegations of sexual violations by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of these data belongs to the Office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the representative's staff member, the newspaper The Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is absolutely not responsible for the leak of these data.
These baseless allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do must not be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
It has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Barbara Walters with the criticism that the Democrats are referring to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running against Waters in the general elections, also appeared on Twitter.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified "the relevant bodies and law enforcement bodies" of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they suffer legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous for my entire cabinet," she continued.
Reviews of the film "Johnny English: Again on Task" – not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spies
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel, titled "Johnny English", was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens titled "Johnny English again".
Will our own satire on how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
Incompetent Johnny English with his eyes and rubber face again has a license for a more complicated situation, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is, of course, a rogue secret agent who despite his bizarre pretenses of "diluted" glamour resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a breath of character Mr Bean and somewhat resembles that guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
His character is also inspired by the traveller and the mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV commercials for Barclay and the image of chaos.
There are one or two hot moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually high, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "The Impossible Mission" are offering themselves elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, the crazy stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's dumb gegs embodied in Mr Bean's image.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker entered the most secret British spy web network and discovered the identities of all British agents, the horror of an agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in an unfortunate short appearance.
This has shed a glass of the prime minister's patience, a pompous and combative character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully display a character who is supposed to represent Theresa May, but she did not get the material with which to do something.
Intelligence consultants reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless with Johnny English's head and beard who is currently employed as the principal of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few hot gegovs here because English teaches rock-style spying.
English is quickly brought to the government's premises for an emergency meeting, where he meets with Bough again, his former partner and his eternal sacrifice, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelija Bulletin, who was embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Walt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous stories: disguised as waiters burn down a fancy French restaurant, cause a huge mess by sneaking on Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the interior of Walt's house looks like.
Everything is done right for this last sequel, but as attractive and flabby as it is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I was wondering again, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talents?
Labour Party disproves to elaborate a plan that the British work four days a week and get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan according to which the British would work four days a week and be paid for the five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the company heads to pass on the savings achieved by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be "accompanied" to the party's economic programme and plans for the country to bow to the interests of workers.
The union congress supported the transfer to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it is a bid that fits into the approach that this party has to balance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept the claim.
Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to seize power from the hands of "insecure directors" and "professor" in municipal enterprises.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their overall stakes because the Labour government could make "rejections" on the basis of observed irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10 per cent of private companies' capital to employees, who would earn an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the Agency's conclusion could affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the debate, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they were brought forth, and asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, he was steadfast, he was unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it really should be a strong accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett firmly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the persons she has appointed has been able to confirm its claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of events, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Property Project, an international advocate group in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful means of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen really, considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand an invitation to action, or just another case called "clitiquism" – where people feel that by signing an Internet petition or sending tweets they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have sought to achieve a number of different goals.
He claims that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would lead to more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership between investors and contractors in the United Kingdom, which advocates "helping children develop to their full potential", with a promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes only footnote in history," said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the "The Power of Nutrition" Foundation, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project "The Power of Nutrition" to provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult road. Sometimes we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, as did great movements for civil rights and against apartheids before us, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's event in New York to be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy as a "blockado" to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner weekly.
Zinke said that Russia's engagement in Syria especially where it operates at the call of the legitimate government is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
In his opinion, however, there are ways and means to address this problem.
"The United States with the help of the Navy can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blockades, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those present at an event hosted by a non-profit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, which is represented in the US as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, and told Russia that "is used by the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as Trump's administration's intention to increase the exports of its intrinsic natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In that sense, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "capital" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream gas pipeline 2, worth $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position triggered a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German Industry Organisation, the Federation of German Industrys (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility to run for president in 2020, says state senator Massachusetts
State senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential bid after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman headed," The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren voiced her opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying "this country leads in the wrong direction".
"I am terribly concerned that Donald Trump is doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
But a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Research of the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of the vote for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other prominent Democrats' names discussed in connection with the 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying for September.
He was also arrested for an incident of domestic violence that took place Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are returning to," Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told the audience.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he was silent about both his son and other war veterans said they "return a little different, return hard, return wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to this country, and all other members of the army."
He was arrested in Wasilla on Monday, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence against a female, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, spokeswoman for the Washington City Police Administration.
18 federal states and D.C. back review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District support a legal challenge to a new US policy that deprives asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support an asylum seekers who dispute politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but US officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States changed the decision of the Immigrants Committee adopted in 2014 allowing immigrants who do not have documents and who are fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian county lawyer Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that a new policy "inorates decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law states that all asylum requirements are resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court's friend's report said.
Lawyers further argued that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering the US economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered Immigrant Judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems, and not even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Ris Kusuma, while comforting her boy who was shaking in a fever at the evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palou.
‘Vehicles of emergency assistance shall be delivered to the bodies every minute.
The government lacks clean water."
The residents were seen going back to their destroyed homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were congested.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered a fracture in his back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continued severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been squished inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "maltrating" through "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page long ad in the American daily newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of US and Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the US propaganda press.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to a paid addition to China Daily newspaper in Iowa's most sold newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the US congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials in Reuters' statement described as a new stage of an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to post commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's revenges in the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor Iowe, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "is now doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by putting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at a newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited votes of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic pathway because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to make an offer" his article, though it did not say what the paper was.
Kavanaugh's debacle Republicans removed voters before the mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans stand by the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him for several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been quite alarmed, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to cast their voice.
Such things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, told an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed his suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake's latest insistence (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday but they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," the newspaper in Washington, D.C., quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, as saying on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang: "Comes November!", protesting in the Senate corridor while Republicans who control the Judicial Committee prepared to resume their appointment with Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Enhusiasm and the motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the news.
"People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by a candidate for Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest a negative reaction could occur if republicans continue with confirmation.
"It's a real mess for the big old party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about the way the Republicans joined it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps select Democrats, said for the news.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more prone to it.
A new poll published by YouG shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truthfulness of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford made, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops based on Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the place of storage of their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network storage of data" or "pod".
It may contain contact lists, list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision on who can access which information completely users.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would completely turn overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as it runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the World Wide Web Foundations and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Priest of World War I Victoria’s Cross · Global Voices
Celebrating in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was decorated with Victoria's cross as a fighter in World War I , it was acclaimed in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29th 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had received the greatest British military honor.
A memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandkids at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he received the recognition.
According to the London Gazette Official Journal, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the St Quentin channel "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the battlefield and machinery room".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and, with "incredible courage," led the unit forward before he rushed without any help to the Polish cannon and cut three of them out of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I could never achieve, and what arouses humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also passed a wedding after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band Parade.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Peppu
Imagine this Stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to ultimately prevent you from following the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Great Britain, live nights on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Great Britain remained in shock when the transmission broke off Poščić Peppa.
Many were not at all impressed after they remained awake until early morning because of the struggle.
A fan of child cartoon termination on Twitter described it as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6am, so they had to switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Peppa Pig."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider reviewing, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday, when they will be with us on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut, there were many correspondences that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a state-of-the-art problem.
I can promise you next time it won't come to that.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six, which is what we do, and we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferiore” about sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-olds said that as long as he didn't go to high school he wasn't aware that "not everyone was like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympic Games has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular director of the long-time show, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
As an apostasy on the first Laverne show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others during his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day these feelings of inferiority and diversity were real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed.”
He says he wanted to prove he was "someone and something," so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who advocated LGBT persons and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Rohit Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy to live without consequences and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said he was surprised that he fell in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than him last year, but said that his age difference was never a problem.
“When so young you go through so much,” he looked back on his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later” he said that it was hard to find someone in the same age and that he had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the story would be about 'to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing out, and only when he stopped breathing and died, did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song by the singer Heather Small , who echoed in it during the preparation for the Olympics , and to which he always gets chilly .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to regain his shape completely to avoid the unfortunate turning point.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12th time in this two-year contest, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in a Saturday game with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and developing his game at the exercise site in hopes of correcting what is bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is ready for the demanding Le Golf National court, where long irregular terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the precise British Open Francesco Molinarii, who won all four matches with newest Tommy Fleetwood this week in the ninth match.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man. He couldn't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There is a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I sure as hell didn't imagine he was playing two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's how we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought certain immaterial values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup individual matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant race.
Danac debuted in the match in Valderram in 1997, where the team of Captain Seva Ballesteros had the advantage of five points compared to the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 14 -  - 13 .
"You keep reminding us that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a close distinction," Bjorn, in the picture, said, after watching Teams 2018, which won the score of 5 - 3 on Friday and yesterday, led the result of 10 - 6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play full force tomorrow.
Get on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors on the board come out.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that leaves the focus.
I've been talking all the time, focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're quite aware of who's standing opposite us, the biggest players in the world."
Rejoiced with the performance of his players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run before the ore in this.
Tomorrow we must face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as an individual, they're at the ultimate test of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you have to pass on to the players, and she's that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate because he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these major turns of the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in the Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that collision starts in a certain direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on middle fights.
And we've organized our setup accordingly, and we've set up the boys as if, you know, we're going to try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counter attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it includes everything," Bjorn said of selected players for individual matches.
German new warship put on hold again
The German Navy's latest frigate was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The release of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after the delivery struck the fate of an ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, ordered by the navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include the longer maintenance period and should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the port of origin.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to show its power abroad, will already become obsolete by the time we enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 arrived at all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make a warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by crews of about 120 sailors, half as much as on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved that the ship is dramatically too heavy to reduce its efficiency and restricts the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the “Rheinland-Pfalz” of 7,000 tonnes is twice the size of ships similar to those used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project will also become a problem, including crew training.
It is said that the price has reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the navy is in fact " running out of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as the old ships were put out of operation and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Würtemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation is listening to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in Scotland is aimed at finding out how bats use landscapes to hunt food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to manage future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will be followed by ordinary and swamped dwarf bats, as well as brown long-winded and river bats in Inverewa gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameramen will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile examinations using hand detectors.
The professional analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind of noise it does.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be drawn to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of work on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and work on the arrangement that affects shelters and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of building material, and attacks of pet cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on the path of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the estate of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species living in Scotland live.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have huge bat space," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there is much more that we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us to understand better what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the accidental destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don't know how their population is progressing."
Ronaldo rejects rape claims as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "false news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says the five-time Golden Ball conqueror in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," he added a football player with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reports of suspicions in the area of privacy", Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that a footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most severe violations of personal rights in the past few years."
It is said that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment in Hotel and Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where she was allegedly raped anally, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after an alleged incident and told her that "99%" is a "good guy" who was failed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and that they photographed her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "scared of retribution" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
A 40-year-old woman says she now wants to annul the settlement because she remains traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United during an alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juva as part of a 100m-euro crossing.
Brexit: UK Will "Repent Forever" · Global Voices
The UK will "repent forever" if, after Brexit, it loses its world leader status in car production, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it's "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in the event Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of waiting at the border in the Brexit case could cause loss of jobs without agreement.
The Burnaston-based plant produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis Last year produced nearly 150 000 cars, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my view that if Britain exits the EU in late March without agreement, we will experience production congestion at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK voiced fears about leaving the EU without agreement over possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer concerns the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line operates according to the "right on time" principle, where parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operated by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, a break at the border that industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at his factory in Derbyshire couldn't hold more supplies than they needed for a day, they said from the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "accurately calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only the maintenance of the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 said today's programme.
"The evidence not only of Toyotas, but also of other producers show that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful series of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Union of the Union, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never return."
The government spokesman says: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the White House continues to fight the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in elections, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy state attorney, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been raving gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing carrying wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of announcing that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked questions about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week considering everything else that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences is not the result of the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are being exposed."
Then she suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organises more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have analysed the figures."
Short speeches will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try often to make it possible, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and just so you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short press talks."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarrely, in front of the group of journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed by National Health Services (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff employed by the Scots NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter not full six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to subsisting the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving towards expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So now I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Friends from all over the EU, as well as beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
Linen player Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after suffering head injury in Saturday's defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a result of 31 gnome 27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"It came to the playground line and it just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on a stretcher and sent it for further tests.
A representative of Tennessee State State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there is no "speciality of the type/obsession" and that Tennessee State is trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing field, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shootings before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign customers will be charged a higher fee in the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corby's bid to attract young voters to promise to provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in the fee will be charged by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee will be added to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago to other homes and real estate purchased for the purpose of the issue can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise £120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not have residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for customers who buy the first real estate to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country especially in the capital have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the fee to help a number of young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not taking advantage of the country, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable property to repair "the shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of zero-provoked mirages.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream of each new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British people.
The dream of having a home has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness remains very real."
Jack Ross: "It is my ultimate ambition to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "find ambition" is one day to become the governor of Scotland.
Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after again taking St. Mirren to the Scottish football championship last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only come true if I was successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's post include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
Former Chief Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel afraid because he succeeds so famous names in such a big club after he previously refused calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"A success for me at this point will be measured against whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross finishes only three years of his management career, after which he was the assistant chief in Dumberton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling into third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the winner of next season's title.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirque, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real intersection," he recalled.
"I really believed that governance is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I've been doing well, making a solid living and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure work, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."
You can listen to the whole interview at Sportsbound on Sunday, September 30, on the Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 1:00 BST.
The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, as the research shows.
The summer heat wave has increased revenues to British pubs that have been struggling with finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data suggests that pubs and bars achieved an increase in revenues in July by 2.7 per cent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Chief Manager of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of good time and the participation of England in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of the pubs increased by 2.8%, with restaurants now even more affected.
A 1.8% decline in restaurant revenues in June only deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have achieved much greater gains on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mainly used also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, drinking sales increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM for rest and hospitality, said "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the decline in sales of 4.8% at year-on-year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-saving locals, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give us the necessary rest."
The total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the share of trade marks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industrial Sales Monitoring System for the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents.
Research reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
News heightened fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that shows parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts  - reference to a website for photo sharing.
The news has heightened fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said they were using a cleaned "main" account to show their parents, while having private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged other words "rape me".
The study, conducted by the Digital Aware UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the race at 200m and 400m in the 1996 games in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic gold, and now is a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischaemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was arduous, but fully recovered, learning to walk again and today to practice agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on an advertisement for a traitor who compares mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advert to mothers who breast-feed their children compared to cows that are initiated by the museum is divided opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's first silent carrier", Elvie's consumer technology company has published an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that a new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of haystacks and cows with music that says, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't udder, it's my breasts."
Then comes the chorus: "Purple, pump, feed the baby with it, pump it, pump it, mate your ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it sheds light on the milk industry's "treasures".
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal from them a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Issuer Elvie discreetly fits the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “It is understandablely traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A completely lame commercial."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was “smiley. ”
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Giving milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial aimed at mothers who betray milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of a campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the release.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the Mother agency, commented: “The traitor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put the betrayal and all its challenges at the centre, and at the same time in a fun and understandable way to demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that a new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that a traitor named Elvie made the cover.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on a fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it difficult for children to be placed under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to endanger their own option of staying in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested earlier had not been recorded in the criminal records.
"Above 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's sponsorship are illegal, and many of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, with the aim of faster implementation of the child's proceedings, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was earlier standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not personally, in order to present their case before the immigration court for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
The advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that signs of child suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the exception of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the assembly said.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are mostly training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "expanding irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and an opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel uprising has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish accord prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces, with Russia's support for the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including the Nusra front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to form a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime terms, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's show "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed ratings with as much as 3.5 million viewers during the main news broadcast nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said the ABC drama producer "Designed Survivors", about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capital.
Nell Schovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied: “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories that come from Washington can determine the future of the law on the abortion of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear", about the jacket of Paul Manafort of an Noah’s skin worth $15,000 (“a class full of pride”, writes Washington Post), and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, of Mr Trump’s anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"The part of what he makes you experience as reality show is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "The pawnshop", about the rotating performance and daily complications of Trump's show (the fight with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'll be behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleissa this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung about the end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside is being left in the most uncertain middle-term election race for Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reconstruction of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently reconstructed district of the suburban part of Pittsburgh stands out as Democratic Conor Lamba Rohit, who won the second district seat in special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, the republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally tailored in favour of the republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a campaign to finance campaigns between the main parties' fund-raisers, the Committee that raises funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed special March 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little priority to the Democrats.
The United States wants to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdraw
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", spokesperson Heather Nauert said.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated $140m in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
Proposed penalties, which include reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as an effort to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, and thus ended any consideration of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
On behalf of Mr Bolton, the White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be the report by special investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trumpo obstruction of the judiciary, which is now highly publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller has also reportedly directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our election.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to re-emerge in front of the voters, perhaps eventually and the jury of his peers.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trum's fall is inevitable -- nor those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such dots of Inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or late.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy State Attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble ever since this paper reported that last year he secretly proposed to record the president and speculated on his incompetence for the service.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair?" Or if it has been confirmed for the Supreme Court despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in the middle-term election for the Congress which will call Mr Trump to account?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light a Sabbath candle on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers are hosting the Rapids from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after an impressive remy in Spain against Villarrell at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season to a 2-by-2 remium with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a bounceboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled a point.
We may have been able to steal the game in the end, but in general, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
It's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive score.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The guys are good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Let's hope we can move on now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that researchers had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people discussed this with their family members.
About half of the nation’s study respondents said they had discussed the costs of long - term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance nation.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for providing care unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, for these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Turn on your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay those costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth.
Take care of your legal documents: In the root, prevent legal battles.
Enlist health care professionals to determine a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able to do so.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Hold that plan by your hand."
A man shot multiple times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by shots from an air rifle as he returned home after night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and an increase in deaths is expected.
Since communications were cut off, relief officials could not obtain any information from the province of Donggale, areas north of Palua that are closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 - degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some key facts about Paloo and Donggali, on the island of Sulawisi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawisi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was struck by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a district that stretches more than 300km of coast on the northwestern island of Sulawisi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstone of the Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Pala and Donggal have been hit several times by tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggali.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Zimbabwe on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake hit one of the island of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake hit the Pydie Jay region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Big earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and resisting arrest, a report released Saturday by state police officer Alaska said.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and remains on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A violations, which means he could be in jail for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a B-class violation, which is being punished one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of the report of domestic violence and possession of alcoholised weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son's violent behaviour with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the immediate proximity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social networks there are video records showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for a suspect in a New York terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York City are looking for a death sentence for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment for a federal crime that hasn't been committed in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to attack a bike trail along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, cutting down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted a serious physical injury, according to an announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of Saipova struck a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of murder and extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "severe planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saip caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrichi, Hernan Diego Mendose and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," the intentional statement states.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York, 1953, when a couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to report to the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of letting go, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A conservative member of parliament says NIGEL Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the people's army" during protests at a conservatives' conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics since one of the members of Parliament Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
The conservative representative, Peter Bonne, told a procession in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been "out by now" that Mr. Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in the reconciliation of her deeply divided ranks is that the Torians are prone to the remnant who join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of an attack by supporters of Brexit, supporters of the rest and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite its reaction and force Eurosceptics and laborists to choose between its packages and "kaosa".
Mr. Bonne said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihull that he wanted to "refuse the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have received the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I'll fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers."
Voicing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
The conservative and supporter Brexit Andrea Yankees was also in the procession, addressing reporters with the words, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are about to fail a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us people "and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say 'it won't pass'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the edge of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel pressure.
We're mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we won't rest until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
The crowd of activists waved at the "Torijeci v Brexit" banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus" plan, for the uninterrupted state at borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of her future Saturday for direct association with citizens in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It's been at the centre of speculation for some time now that it might oppose Trump in 2020.
A meeting Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman in charge."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., announced on Saturday that she arrested a shooting suspect with the death outcome of the University of Louisiana State (LSU) basketball player Wade Sims, who took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20) at 11am at a conference for ET journalists.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern campus.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene and owned a weapon and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year high 198 cm student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches in the 10 first sets last season and average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion's title after his order assures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear on Saturday that the team order "will play a big part in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettle to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to get into the start-up traffic, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the wheel action, which is why the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the free interior at risk of lagging behind after a double move in the third corner's defense.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran a large part of the race while relying on his tires to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a rough day since Valteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has done a really remarkable job to achieve a formal finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally Saturday for insisting she didn't release a letter to Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and nasty and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let-- No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had arrived from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not release her story in public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret, which she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come across the approval of the president, who commented at a meeting Saturday night: "Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats use these charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to return power at all costs.
You see the wickedness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the President said, mediaite conveys.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5  - 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday's victory in Dundee on Saturday's score 5'3.
The Giants came to an advantage in the early minutes of two naked blows by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie led domestics to equality, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard evened it out for Dundee before two of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's goals guaranteed victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for the Adam Keefe team, which came from behind and beat Dundee by the score of 2'1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting of the two teams, and the Giants won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening game arrived in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., with the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, along with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by hitting Beauvilier four minutes later.
In the hasty opening of the game, Sullivan returned home team to play at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquart allowed Cawnie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in measuring the force with the goal at 27:37.
Cawnie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to lead the first Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team was already halfway through the last third of the game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five matches, are hosting the Milton Keynes teams in the next match Friday.
The air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a major earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
However, despite his colleagues’ escape to save their lives, Anthonyus Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post in the Mutiara Airport Control Tower, Sis Al-Yufri, who rocked hard.
He remained to ensure the safe takeoff of Batik Air on flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transferred to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Paloo.
"Our heart is breaking because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear thousands of people could reach the deaths, and the state's disaster mitigation agency says limited access to the cities of Donggali, Sigia and Boutongo is limited.
"It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not be found," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an agency spokesman.
Waves that reached the height and up to six metres destroyed Pala, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulances every minute bring bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing for survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and said to the country's army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
An aircraft company that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Minnesota now claims that one man is being led missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, I cannot trace one of the passengers.
The air carrier said they co-operated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
Which caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane flew very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to break through the water that went up to their waist to the exit in the event of a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair the docks also helped rescue using a boat to blow people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres of water.
Air Safety Network data show that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugina.
Analyst exhibits a time review of the night in which a woman is burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up the case in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described him using cell phone data to put together a puzzle on the move of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, carried by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if he was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that he said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records suggested they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers died, erased her messages, calls and phone contact details.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin the closing statement Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed in Bristol claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and referring to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in Great Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues a couple for firing after a "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory resignation after getting a misspelled message from a mother calling her "another black woman".
The couple deny that they are racists, comparing the charge with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on the first day of 2016.
"NEEEE Another black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in her husband's message.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "unfortunate" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because she claimed that their former nanny, who was African-American, had been misrepresenting her job, and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, transferred to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and asking for $350 a day for a period of six months for which she was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying that ending Maurice's job was reasonable to do, because of the concern that her insult would not be believed afterwards.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco for Post.
"But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little stuffed bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as a "very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and was not a boaster," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was seen as some achievement of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was looking at it that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always credited credit to Paddington only."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say it is really bad and to believe he will not get away," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she will die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate were slowly losing effect and leaving her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then everything went out.
All I had to do was sit around and wait and know what to do next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me."
After all, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in mourning for losing her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers - who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages of women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a bright career.
"All remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found a brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards "so people know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence You need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom when the children opened their presents, didn't look them in the eyes or wanted anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to get over it: “It all leaves a large cavity in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we'll move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought we might be able to bring in a little unity if we were really able to get something like what he was looking for by a limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the board "was falling apart" amid the rooted party blockade.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is driven by choice of moment.
The mid-term elections will arrive in just five weeks, November 6th , if Republicans are not expected to go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the election for the country's highest court.
George W. Bush constantly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors from North Korea 'fall' led by Kim
The number of defects from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the United South Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 defects last year compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that key factors are stricter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more fees that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers defectors illegal, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
The relations between the North and the South have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearisation talks.
This came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work on liberating the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is not possible that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm ourselves," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that because of her temperament, she was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have called it 'hysterical'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, calling charges against him "grotesque and co-ordinated innuendo" organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court because he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if he would try to recall Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelos has caved in.
"I will say the following: "If he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not capable not only of being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that, as a democratic, she was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Accessory Care or the law on the abortion of the Roe v. Wade case, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh went around asking whether he would alter some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expects us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has been collected for months and years can't be solved without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be executive director and who said she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘ You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated, is that once when I cried for unspeakable anger, an older woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad, so they will be glad because they will think that they have struck you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and Seven Dwarves".
Since the campaign had already moved away, it was lagging behind in fundraising, and she swore she would not enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave men 1,000 dollars, gave her only 250 dollars.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she said she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in the emotion of thanking the people who supported her, the frustration of a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexism to squeeze her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The start of a trade war between the United States and China has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the divergence between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week appeared with new customs duties affecting 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) products, in fact taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has returned each time in a way, and a recently introduced customs duty of five to ten percent on $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised that the United States will be struck with a blow, and the second largest global economy will certainly not surrender soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by easing the demands, but public obedience to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays his cards well, US trade war pressures can provide positive support in the long term to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic crash in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking that focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in restoring the country that has destroyed a war that lasts for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to create a normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday life and existence are now met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 pi 10.5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown while Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball to the water at first kick, leaving the match to Francesk Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has brillianted in all rounds and has become one of four players who has ever made it to 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament began this format.
The American Jordan Spieth was expelled by Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most victory in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop the tears.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the Cup again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, full of emotion after European victory.
He conveys the torch to his countryman John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2 & 1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have given resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get through this, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Board, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
