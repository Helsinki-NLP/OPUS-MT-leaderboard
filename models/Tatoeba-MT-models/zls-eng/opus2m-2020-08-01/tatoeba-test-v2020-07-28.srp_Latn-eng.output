Tom's gonna get better.
Tom works in marketing.
They're a quintet of tin tobacco instruments.
I don't care if our team wins or not.

What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little down.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps whining about how she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they say it quickly.
She didn't even blink.
What did that all mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean something to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the job done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
It's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna take?
I'm teasing you.
If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it goes into his head.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more stuff at the same time.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you in private?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put the ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left my keys.
Where did you get that scar?
You wouldn't think of her appearance, but the story of a child who ate two cakes was from her childhood.
I can't live that life.
Tom's as hungry as a wolf.
It was a difficult decision.
Everyone's crying.
The octopus Paul was right.
He loves football a lot.

I'm not ready yet.

Don't draw attention.
Do you think games and learning are compatible?
I think that's all funny.
Layla has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's your age car?
An account, please.
Make sure the cat's outside and the door's locked when you leave.
It remains to be seen if I can make it there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom was nervous about getting his fingers on the table.
Did you go out last night?
I have a game to play.
That needs a doctor.
I like instrumental music.
You should thank Tom with a letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.

Are you involved in this?
I thought it was horrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.

Can you save me some cookies?
I have an allergy to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolate.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna let this go.
Let me help you avoid any problems.
I've never tried this before.
Did I drop it?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because he's a male chauvinist pig.
I've been all over Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need any help, let me know.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have a high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom was shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everyone's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where was she going?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.

The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I passed every test.
I'm sick of your whining.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll take a look.
He's very busy right now.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kylie Minogue since 12 June 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
Danger lurks on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're getting reckless.
Is it necessary to make that kind of noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're very helpful, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't get away from the past.
Please excuse me for being late.
Tom, keep it to himself.
I hope I find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.

We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
I can't answer your question with any certainty.

Let's talk about options.
I was just about to suggest you do it.
She decided to go and study in the United States.
It was really inspiring.

So, what do we do?
This is my third marriage.
Next time, I'm sure it'll be better.
The text has been highly processed.
We're all trying to win.

Nothing can stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Jom brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was over the Middle Atlantic Reef - a mountain range located at the bottom of the ocean, at a depth of up to 4500 feet [4,500 m].
Yeah, I love it!
It was kind of awkward.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dismissed.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came through the window.
It was something that led to a series of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's heavy.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was intrusive.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes.
I wasn't worried about that.

Did you tell Tom this?
You'll ruin your eyesight if you play games all the time.
I'm a Earther.
I can read different foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are gonna happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
It'll take me a while to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We don't want to get wet.
You're kind of right.
Even though I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
Simple as beans.
A lot of things are going well for me.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
You're wasting your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequence.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you going to do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have the paper I can write on?
Is it true Tom won the race?
Can I hear one more?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better if you don't eat after seven at night.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.
You were right to shave.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Tom lives downtown.
Don't be sassy.
Things are so different now.
I'm just curious.

I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
You're infected.
We need your help.
Is Tom notified?
Tofu's good with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I don't feel like swimming.
She's as beautiful as her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It's not standing.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come inside.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so hard to imagine that plate movements were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them just as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I acted instinctively.
You've got to do it somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload videos to YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you fully recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining so bad.
Tom's sick today.
That's what both of them like.

I'm sad to leave.
Tom almost got caught.
They're the ones who want to leave.

What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come inside.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful.
You've got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Start counting.
You must never come back.
He's a man of flesh and blood with all his faults.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He ended up in prison.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom saves money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called favoring, if she's promoted, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would prefer to stay.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I'm here.
We are who we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut your dirty mouth.
Show me the papers.
I still mourn the death of my eldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you coming back now?
She must be over 60.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I've never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this in private.
I'm on Tom's side.
Almost caught ans a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's best man.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a bigger friend.
You're lying!
Even the kid knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a moller.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're right.
They can never achieve it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance at that.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom's laughing, Mary.
It's almost half past three.
I don't know if that'll be enough money for me.
Can you put the curtains on?
You ever tried it?
That seems inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied his seat belt.
I thought it was yellow.
I'm celebrating.
I'm adamant against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here before.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Jawbreaker is a round multilayer candy similar to a pearl.
What's your problem?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't fight.
Just take care of yourself, Tom.
I'll figure it out.
I'm in better shape than you are.
Maybe they're around the pond somewhere.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Leave it alone, Tom.
It's impossible to say for sure.
Tom's never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Let's get started.
It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore the country's old empire.
Would you like some more tea?
The nail punctured the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
Little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "The experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher angry, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope it'll be dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't hang around.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom proposes could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all left.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love from once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I got a white horse.
Let's talk about this over lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We must respect our personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland want to come with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you even eating?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he failed.
Yumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother's a Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
The limbs of the cold thorn.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
Did you know Tom ever lied?
Mary's Catholic, but her boyfriend's an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy right now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're not hanging out.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
It took four kilos of gold to gold out the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers to his head.
Take care of me, and I'll look after you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak plainly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income has dropped by ten percent.
It may be hard to go around unknown terrain.
They're ready to discuss the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long study, I ended up making stuff at random.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're cutting back.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the TV.
I'm wearing short-sleeve shirts in summer.
Old people talk to themselves a lot.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's the Avis counter?
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I'm just on my way.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about it.
I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad for lying.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, porn will be made with that.
Canada is motherland hockey on ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She runs every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a hell of a fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
I didn't do it either.
How much is a bottle of beer?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad!
I'm sick of arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on her math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else into the room.
It's better by force than by force.
There's trouble waiting for you.
There is no "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more stuff at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
The ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I haven't been told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary did.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You're getting fat fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more stuff at the same time.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a second.
I knew I should never have interfered with your foolish business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom was able to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
I just don't want to do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid addicts on the paint thinner.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller skates?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy hanging out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was spinning around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna make it.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic fingertips, creating music that's very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds broke a lot of tree branches last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The path to a man's heart leads across his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house was built out of brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partially responsible.
People have been good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could come with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning on doing.
To join the choir, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom's taking a nap.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you back.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human being to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was present at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stupid, insensitive children can sometimes grow up into sociopaths.
I'd like to have her at your place.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very quickly.
You're different.
She's a stranger to the hatred of others.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
The monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the meds.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
It's an hour-and-a-half drive to work.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us feel that such views are pure madness.
Someone might get hurt.
Tom didn't write a single letter to Mary while he was away.
We've had enough of you.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled the thick end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass or your sisters?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He wrote himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I made a contribution.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
It's time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting execution is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin's a crypt.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Uh..." And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent her criticism to Mecca." "Yes." "What did you tell her you learned from it?" "I realized that Phillips's screwdriver was convincing, but not seductive; and that Retti was hard to charge the things I think he should do as a friend."
I've always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years like a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to sleep.
Tom will wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should be doing it.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is such a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth to what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of you complaining.
Get out!
We've got two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She has achieved her goal.
Tom can do as he pleases, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of us like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
The two sides will be giving speeches this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why'd you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in a cast.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That needs help.
Defend yourselves.
He took a cab to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's asleep.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.
It's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to leave.
Eagle is the king of birds.
The fire hit the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've got this all wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm grounded.
The cat lay all the way out in the sunlight that penetrated the window.
On foot or on a bike, you go to school?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed by that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, her beautiful face and her young body, is of transitory value.
I saw a mouse.
He's trying.
The two states negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That's what a dream needs.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing that.
I've got a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I've been acting instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked and barefoot.
She's just out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services paid by taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at it again.
Sounds like treason to me.
That's what you need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Get the hot dogs!"
Drive slow.
What a man you are!
Double aim, once cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save a little time if we do what Tom proposes.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto, why this language is beautiful at the same time, and it stimulates our learning, because the international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world, and besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn, if you learn Esperanto, you can travel many countries.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get any sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I wasn't interested.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You're never on time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to bother you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make progress.
Tom was completely scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We've got to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was moaning out of pain.
All or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame on him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope she's okay.

I have a mirror in my bedroom from floor to ceiling.
I wish I could have remembered that.
Don't say a word.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-check festival took place in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?

Bigger wound.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how you act important.
How long did you stay?
Tom's a passionate cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hideout?

I don't completely agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat the ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.

It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?

Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.

I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.

Come help me.

Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous football player.
I was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Are we going to see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.

I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.

Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.

Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom's a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would be happy to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, only if we get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating garlic in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.

Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.

I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
First one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was a little weird.
Does he read and write Japanese to that?

It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now a word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help himself.
It's bedtime.

I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought food was great.
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
You look fat.
You have to learn English step by step.
That's better than he had before.
Tom and Mary differ like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who's gonna win the race.
A man has many desires that he doesn't really want to meet and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment to him. One such wish is the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would yearn for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She takes care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.

Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a regular.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphony.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.

Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, I don't.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
Are you texting Mary?
I'll save you a spot in the front row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you find out?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals have unrelentingly tortured animals.
How long are you gonna be mad and yell at us?
How important is that?
Shall we have an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukulele.
I'm used to it already.
It's not that bad.
I like to play music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard working with you.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It's necessary to tear down several old houses.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very thoughtful.
When are you going to leave?
This report isn't written very well.
She points out that this last move of government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost his whole face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world by its size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.

Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom's got the vegetarian chili ready.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really nice to me.
Who are you really?
We've all cried so much.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself, it's all these devastating questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
It looks uncomfortable.
What have you both done?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
I wish you were there for me.
Try this.
Clean it up.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do it either.
Let's take another look.
Last time I went to the beach, I burned badly.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've fixed some damage caused by a rock spray on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid to die.
I can't fix the car by myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into this.
Hang on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled the thick end.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom won't escape.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
No free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm sorry.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He learns by doing what he does.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom goes to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough of this.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It's just how it happens.
Have some.
He's talking about others how much he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's OK.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
Reaction isn't always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated for the proportional part of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
But it was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the filenames before trying to restore deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.

We won't let you die.
A lot of things work out for me.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been getting ready for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
Don't be a pain in the ass.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the thick end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting on my turn.
I've been getting a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have some tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid one spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a mail shipment?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved slowly forward.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't stare.
It's blue on you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
A map, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives behind God's feet.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You have a long day ahead of you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass your exams?
I'm all for your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
The knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing mistake.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom's got a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got bad hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Toma's gonna take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could come with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you defuse the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?

What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Nationality is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's repairing electronic devices.
You're losing.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to stand up to this.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where'd you find the keys?
You ever hang a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in participating in building a more intense academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?

I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.

Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother named John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep your mouth shut all the time?
He took off his clothes.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated the right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What's the point of life?
Drive the pole.
My right hand is numb.
I don't know anything about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
He was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I resigned.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve me to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you pass me the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more diligently.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do it.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
You're embarrassing her.
I got two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't support it.
I didn't care about that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for kids.
It's been a pain in the ass.
What'd you figure out?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom broke into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little guy.
Control yourselves.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things are gonna happen.
A few trees fell during a storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everyone smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I give up.
Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have work to do tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I filled a glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the entire village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did was very helpful.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Smoke slept with 25 men one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we on our way soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
The cost will soon rise.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.

We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, general precautions should be taken to avoid infections in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like a man who's being held back.
The room was dark.
He's going home.

I can't fix the car by myself.

My mother was an alcoholic.

I barely closed my eyes.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom's named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
What makes you say that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She wrapped her hair with papillotes.
He's been released from military service.
They're bleeding to my right.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better men.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you dancing.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She's making it out of a mosquito elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite, rather than a broad mass representative.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question of what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.

Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to improve.
The house burned to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The most rainy months are May, June, July and August.

It's hard to be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing the dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do it.
Tom will pay.
The hunting season is over.
I like cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their innate talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.

I don't think you should be hasty with anything these few days.
What's in nature forever, when everything is so fleeting?

Everything you've got will one day have you.
As busy as Tom is, he never forgets that our e-mail to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?

Because of the bad weather, the plane was running late.
Look into them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.

I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before it was sent for laboratory testing.

Look around.
It's been a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was watching closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
This was sophisticated and decorated in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that few people dared to work closely with him.

Tell us a ghost story.
Check everyone.
The session is over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved 300 bucks.
What does she look like?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way over.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese into thin slices or little cubes.

I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused real interference.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.

The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the class.
I'm touched.

Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for deaf audiences.

Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA is rotting to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only 5:00 in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with it will eventually happen.
Tom's good at French.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
I know this is weird.
He never got over the death of his son.
I'm just doing my duty.
They all sat down.
If you have nothing else to do, the number of the Greek island.
She's always wearing a tiny outfit.
Is that going to work out soon?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The idols of Vishnu are called Vishnuans; the worshipers of Shiva are the Shivan.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I've completely lost track of my thoughts.
I've never regretted doing it.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things that people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, suspension."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned down Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, to eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move over.
We should study.
We don't have any other choice.
When it's like this, it's best if you sit at home and don't go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe any images from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
They've all held their breath.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I love watching you work.
I hope we visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half past one.
I'm still a little tired.
To seek to maximise his own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to a human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is nowhere near as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the numbers on the tree we shot down and discovered it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still looks shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're scared of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
You want to chill?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of being a Serb, with their historic highest achievements - the slaughter of the chiefs and genocides?
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Where did I leave my keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom's lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna take a look.
I've got a cell phone that just shows the error message.
I'm surprised.
They all smiled.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame everything for Tom.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was kind of weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one's died... yet.
Can we, people, weld grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We got three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to get you drunk.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They sell sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What have you both done?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and tranquility, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will arrive in Tokyo at half past 11.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Look out!
Tom couldn't give any evidence to back up his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I was just on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to get through the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I've been having trouble solving this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "No P" and/or "Q".
He speaks English.
I'm texting Tom right now.
It's an exception.
Tom came in a little early today than usual.
A horse I could eat.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which one's easier?
Tom requested an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read them on the train on the way to work.
I've got house ghosts.
Look at that.
We're gonna save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do it either.
The stories of Snori Sturluson tell the rest about the spread of violence in Norway by Christianity.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gold-plated necklace with hearts is a necklace that will shake your world.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining heavy.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
The dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Marie jumped out of the window into the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk around holding hands.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom's still got a little time.
The baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I just stalled.
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked apple pie.
He's got a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look at the size of that!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the quality of the water is checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to draw attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into big nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a very long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt for a moment just?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good idea.
I've thought about it before.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were in a meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe that Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in these elections.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said was gonna happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's perfectly normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he was sleeping a lot.
I never thought of that.
Keep your voice down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
He wouldn't like that.
I'm really curious.
Tom double-parked.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Any other options?
The amount for the job and interest on the capital invested was several million.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea rises, the sea rises, the sea rises.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours uninterrupted.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a public presentation.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
It makes me very angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom's strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lezilebovic.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, having become a victim of conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Can you let Tom know I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
One foot in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Why are bunny ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
It's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things on the walk.
This one's really cool.
I was just enjoying myself.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this paper.
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you dance.
I was definitely lucky.
What's the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get high.
I just want to get out of the way.
Don't let him get away with such a good chance.
Be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for showing my, often mutually contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm scared of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we stop that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
What kind of insurance do I have to choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music pieces for the phagot.
Secretary of the United States John Carey broke his right femur in a cycling accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of midwives, the snotty ones are kids.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are on.
Have you fully recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
An accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's for nothing.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the destra side is in New York.
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, this year will be somewhat more modest.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does it.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often rapists in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house yesterday for dinner.
Look at the size of it!
It's a living truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now's a great time to buy one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I was exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You shouldn't judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are asleep.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have any fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and split up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Phase one is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French learning at your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives next door?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna get better.
It is important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to nobody liking me.
The brakes went off.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was 13.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow's a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and have a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A female chiffon isn't complete without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing else to do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked all his life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I got it all wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
As little as we know of her origin, at least we can be sure she's a pilot of the Gospel.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
The deer is faster than the strong.
People used to write books on typewriters.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Maria learn how to drive.

I'll sit down at the table there.

Who's first?

I've made up my mind.
Do you have a copy?
We're going to the movies.
I wouldn't hurt her.
In this stage of world history, there is not one such thing in America as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is none among you that dares to write your honest opinion, and if you wrote it, but in advance you would know that it will never appear in the press. I get a regular salary to keep my honest opinion outside the papers I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you would be so crazy to write what you honestly think, would find yourself out, on the street, looking for another job. That I have allowed my true opinion to appear only in one issue of newspapers for which I work, I would get fired from work in less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie, to defaminate, that the game, that my true opinion lies in front of whose feet, to sell this country and its people for their daily portion of bread. You know it is the same thing as our own, and our fellow journalist.

If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom's gonna get better.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
I could talk to Tom.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing okay.
I could come with you.

It would be different.

It doesn't play any part anymore.

Find out what happened.

Thank you so much for this information!
If I didn't know you well, I'd think you were hiding something.

We've already decided that.
How exciting!
I've been looking for you.
The cold has caused great damage to the crops.

Please tell me I'm right.
My wife, who grew up in Norway, made it clear to me from the first moment that it was no longer relevant for a woman to run around with her husband all day long.

I can't do anything today.
Something wonderful happened today.
You're not rational.
Let it go, Tom.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
How long is the Nile River?

For what?
Are we safe now?

Are you busy here?
We're out of food.

Life's getting really hard.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to.

Please repeat?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?

Please come.
Is breakfast included in the price?
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.

He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said can't apply to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
It didn't matter to me.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
You can't blame everything for Tom.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't buy it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about the plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
He looks young for his age.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to trick?
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can do it.
You can't go in that room.
How old are you?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.

I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car by myself.
Zini!
Please hurry.
Tom nodded.
Should we tell someone?
He's flooded from the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more psychological than physical.
He's out.
He started yelling.
Tom could've been better.
Tom's getting fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't be shy.

The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about it.
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary get along just fine.
When can Tom come home?
I see a reflection of my face in the window.
Go talk to Tom.

You could've spared me coming if you'd told me I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
This will make our dog so much easier.
I've been gone too long.

Shall we see Tom again?
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours incessantly.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Tom's probably still gonna be pissed off.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
That's not what I'm falling for.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted that he was a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Are we starting soon?
You can't go into that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Maria read the whole manual for work from 321 pages in her breath.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.

It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked in many years.
What a beautiful house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?

I bought a lot of things.
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What's all the fuss about?
Tom's confidence was shattered when his boss took it off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most of them are afraid to set themselves a great goal out of fear of never reaching it.
I'm a mess.

What can I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They didn't make it through the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's learning hard.
It takes a lot of imagination trying to add a new sentence here.

Finish this.

How long will Tom last?
Rainy season starts in June.
Who knows what's gonna happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I wish I could paint like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.
We limit our luggage to 10 kilos apiece.
We'll never go back there.
It's been years.
They've established an Air Force Joint Command where the director and chief of staff have been, respectablely, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his ukulele and started singing.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try it.
There's chaos here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's so bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
Lies got him into trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his age.
I really like the members of my team.
What have you both done?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I've got a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister named Mary.
I could've used that.

I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what I have to do.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we know.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really that happy?
The fuse's on fire.
I can't fight it anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows how to knock real fast.
She writes to her son sometimes.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried he's gonna get lost.
I think it's best to be nice.
Africa is the cradle of humanity.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite lecturer was Jackson.
I'm not the only one who didn't like that movie.

I didn't know.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm compassionate.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a little something, isn't he?
Better a kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.

Before this decision comes into force, no one will even lift a finger to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do it.
Tom will talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's accelerated.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I'm used to doing that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I've met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom doing at work?
That needs a doctor.
I want to be human again someday.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I doing here?

I talked to Tom yesterday.
After winning the lottery, she went shopping.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of monitoring many activities on Earth, listening to communications lines, registering radar frequency...

I thought you were taking the bus to Boston.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could've used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs at the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean it's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't stare.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want full sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope Tom's predictions come true.

What were you doing today?
How much am I gonna take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't eat just one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I give you what you want.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm leaving early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what it is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get lost!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you being childish?
We could've saved Tom if we'd arrived a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.

Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?

Who's got time for this?
I'm still sleepy.

What do you have there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
Have a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views on sports.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing flannel pajamas.
I'm scared to death.
There was only one small problem.
I'm all alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't confident at all.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The planes are landing at the airports.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems unhappy.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's out of line.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned around to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put it.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom's gonna be able to help us get through this.
I've already been paid.
They're all messed up.
Did I call you?
Come Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't stare.
They accidentally heard some kind of suspicious activity in the squishy, suggesting that the bear smelled their food.
I've been all over Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't stare.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame everything for Tom.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm devastated.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's class laughed at her for her clothes.
They're either going through it or going through it.
I'll get right on it.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy a walk along the pilgrimage to France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you watch?
Are you busy here?
I choose between two options.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him at half past seven.
We didn't do it.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, pass me the salt.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas book sale, and it's hardly gonna get thrown out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me one more reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
Get changed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well prepared in advance.
That's not what I'm counting on.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls wore weed skirts and had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
He may have already left.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for cross-calculations, insert and use plain tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'm staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
On my shoulder, you can always cry.
I've been reformed.
What happens next time?
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was so sophisticated.
This sad story was written at the time of Tom's exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your husband left you?
Can you prove it?
Dead end.
It's so easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I'd rather not be involved in this right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been terrible.
I'll loan you the workbook if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as me.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
Stiglic is a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the person and the blood type has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I did check some things out.
I'm not singing.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The Data Transfer Working Group, led by Ben Mani, will hold a meeting on January 14th 1999.
Some say that if you step on the rainworm, it will start to rain.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Tom knows how to knock very quickly.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up like that.
I'm giving you what you want.
Who did you write the letter to?
I might need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought the paper and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That'd be okay.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me right now.
There's no policy set.
Write down what I'm saying.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
There was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't set foot outside today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
She was saving her life.
I think we should call a doctor.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom in the act.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big fan of football.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Could you pass me the water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elemental, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to pick you up.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
Drugs don't usually need to be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people no matter what age they are, don't lose their beauty.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's pretty amazing.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Look into it.
She was dressed in red.
What does a Soviet scientist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope is lost when you're experiencing a difficult situation and pointless congestion.
I laughed.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is pure from energy.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dance?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We don't have any other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking of going to Australia myself.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really that individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning up the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialty?
I'm twice Tom's age.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't affect it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are many dishonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
The Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's wonderful.
I think so, too.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with cross bars for wind stability and snow applications, and this must be a two-layer tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's been fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better than his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's interrogating the patient.
Tom passed his drink.
This is a joke of justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't stare.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in his house.
Let's hope you're right.
We split up on the corner.
Are you mad about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did I drop that?
Did you sleep?
They've been tried hard in court.
Is there a reason you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I have your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric's not from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom sat on the bench all day writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
The money's talking.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I double-parked.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I was about to look for you.
He's leading a busy life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.
Anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to breast-shaped deformation if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little woozy.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do anything like that.
I brought these reports so you could take a closer look at them.
I'm not as rich as we'd like.
Get on board.
Tom's still pissed.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria wear her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could come with you.
Sadly, he moved from the almighty God to become a helpless, dirty, small, and insignificant man in the corner of a small province in a vast empire.
We should do better.
Weather forecast says it's gonna rain tomorrow afternoon.
Tom's a gentleman.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.
What planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Okay, we got a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom's very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind blows from.
Women are the most beautiful thing in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is pre-charged.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom loves it the most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
Yesterday I finished studying Esperant at Duoling.
Thomas attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get right to it.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom is being heard because he's convincing.
My suitcase hasn't been packed yet.
Did you sleep?
Readers were in trouble, waiting at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know anyone who passed last year's exam?
Mary took the liberty of traveling.
They live on a high foot.
Tom's out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
You don't exactly support me very much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything, he's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It is human to sin, to forgive it divinely.
I passed all the tests.
I just needed a little time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black jeans.
Must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Have you just met them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this seat taken?
It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the change.
All parking spaces are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
Use the device until it warns you to charge the battery and then charge it for 5 hours to achieve maximum capacity.
Tom's still a bachelor.
You're getting reckless.
No, don't do that.
I had dogs when I was little.
Tom was with a girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not gonna ask Tom to do that.
They were all standing.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you hand me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now's the time to enjoy it.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually do for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice Tom's age.
That's exactly what I said was gonna happen.
Testing the new engine will take place today.
Come and sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things must pass.
Come on, get in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't have a wish for that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom seems a little nasty.
I wish my wife could cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you lost ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll get right to it.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The fuse's on fire.
Are we safe now?
Tom says one day he'll do it.
By the way, what's your address?
This one's awkward.
She's wearing a gold chain around her neck.
The electronics provide a multi-stage and simple adjustment of the air flow.
Have you heard that he's finally back home?
During the clear days, we see Mount Fuji in the distance.
It's your choice.
They're sitting at the table.
It's a multiphase process.
I thought you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.
The assembly is disbanded.
Tell me what you wrote.
It never occurred to me that someone would come up with something like that.
Tom was friendly with me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed a broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom dropped me off at the airport.
You know, don't you?
I'm trying.
I wrote a song about Tatoeba.
I need to catch a train.
I'm in no hurry.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat at the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever listened to such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He kicked the ball in the goal!
It's a big day, son!
We were filled with joyful expectation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'll forgive you, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Wipe your lips with a napkin.
The free library Haskell and Opera House were built on the border between Canada and the United States.
It's very important to rest properly.
You've disappointed me.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Karin is Austrian.
I think I understand.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It was sitting alone.
You have to make a decision.
Every time we talk, he makes my adrenaline work.
Tom's always very nice.
That takes courage.
I have no intention of answering any questions.
Tom suffered a lot of pain.
Stop smoking.
Do you know what that thing is?
Just tell Tom I called.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is all this settled now?
Nothing's free.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
You were supposed to be my friend!
I wasn't too surprised.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write the report?
Tom turned on the heat.
I want to know the reason.
We'll catch up.
I don't usually buy anything off the Internet.
Someone was here.
Did you write in your diary today?
That's the best I've ever heard.
Do you know anyone there who's talking to Urda?
Tom was shot three times.
Come pick me up.
Tom's smiling softly.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could explain that.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.
All of us have received the blessing of blessing from the almighty of her grace.
No matter how much I consider it, I still don't understand.
Tom's thinking the same thing.
I never lend anyone books or CDs.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have many friends.
My children rely on me.
I beg you to reconsider.
It can be treated.
Don't be a pain in the ass.
When they experienced the French Revolution, citizens became free people, freed traditions and churches, praised freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I didn't think it was appropriate.
Tom offered to help when everything seemed to have gone completely wrong.
Whether or not it's a moral choice of translators, things sometimes sound better if they stay as they are in the language in which they were created.
Look what I've grown up to be!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm pathetic.
How long have you lived here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
Anyone who doesn't take any chances doesn't win.
Don't stare.
J. Kepler, astronomer and mathematician, did research on planets and their movements.
That's enough for today.
I've never been camping.
Bury Califa is today the world's tallest skyscraper.
I could help.
She was caught in the act.
I think I know a way to save some time.
That was unfair.
It is a completely unique friendship that has been deepening for many years.
Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe that finding always comes as thunder from the blue sky.
Is that your new boyfriend?
The ship's down.
I agreed to buy it.
It came out of nowhere.
They know you.
Let's go one by one.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's accurate.
I've never seen that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their closeness was mysterious, since they only met three days ago.
I've done that before.
What year was your car built?
I tried to be nice.
Don't sing.
It'd be good if I put on another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the chiffonier.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
Under what name?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Where the hell have you been?
She's smiling.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big fan of football.
You're making Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I'm not good at dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens unless his dream precedes him.
I tried to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very good at mimicking the way Mary speaks.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends smoke.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
I guess that's what Tom thinks.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone changes.
Would you like some more apple juice?
We must not lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me play?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom's very idiosic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any harm.
I was the only man in the tourist group, and the rest of them were Arab women living in Istanbul.
Look into it.
Tom's not the right person to work with.
We have to get better.
They asked for an increase in salary.
Let me see your recipe.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes bickering between families spreads through generations.
It's all because it's upside down.
Tom thinks fast.
The comments must be about the subject.
Don't be shy.
The program sets the conditions for project development and implementation.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me a spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I tried to be nice.
It would be confusing.
Here we are.
You can sit next to me.
That's what pulled the lever.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody's pacing.
All you have to do is practice.
Have you ever milked a cow?
There's a lot of orange fishermen on the river.
All you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I couldn't get on the train because there were so many people.
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
Come again.
She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
What's all the fuss about?
Tom counted the change.
I studied hard when I was in school.
I turned down Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert mirage.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you being honest?
We'll try it your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one was watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never regretted it.
Tom was as angry as a lynx.
Tom could have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What have you both done?
Don't yell.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were teasing her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very fast.
We all did.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay off my debt.
Which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.
His speech was, to say the least, a disaster.
We have to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things are gonna happen.
I thought you already took care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that he'll change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to use it?
I could go there now.
Everyone cheered.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive safe.
Let's see.
Do you have perfume?
Don't play monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
He makes such a face to want you to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When yelling doesn't help, shout louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was reckless.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I want someone to do it for me.
You're still inexperienced.
We're gonna have a great time.
Not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot in here.
Have you fully recovered?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five bucks.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to survive the accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because there's a lot of traffic.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom's gone.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
Drive slow.

Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom wasn't going to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.

Just give me a chance.

I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
The mileage depends on the conditions on the way.
Don't fight.
What did you do now?
The sun was shining, and it was still cold.

Could we order now?
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
There's nothing going on with my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
My children need me.

I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
It broke the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were taking the bus to Boston.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I wish I knew what was going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No, what's the matter?"
That's what both of us like.
You and I need to talk.
You've been spying on me.
The pen I'm writing with belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary stayed good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom muffled his smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everyone's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
I thought I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Stay away from my girlfriend.

I'm not bitter at all.
Yumi is one of my friends.
It just took him a little time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking her clothes off.
Up and down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
I'm adamant against this.
You underestimate me.

The police haven't ruled out the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.

Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write efficiently.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.

Come back in a day.
It had a very different effect than it intended.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It all stopped.
The book's been sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I have no doubt he will succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My father-in-law enjoys the tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They've fooled everyone.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.

She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom put his drink down.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
The pantry's empty.
Tom opted for "against."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer that.
If you'd done it for me, it would've helped a lot.
He was naked and barefoot.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried right now.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.

Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What have you done to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to knock on a typewriter, and he told his teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go outside and eat.
Can I talk to you outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I played it right.
Am I safe now?
Please write it down.
We didn't have this planned for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was visibly shaken.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really that happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a thousand-dollar hat.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.

Tom worked all his life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what both of them like.

Help!
I already ordered it.

Where'd you buy that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this distraction.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is kind of a drill.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.

I'm amazed.
There's nothing left.

I have a plan.
You took my place.

People tell me things.
To the toasts!

Did Tom believe your story?
I was very tired so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I lied.
I don't want anything from you.
How's that going?
Don't argue with me.

I want to feel important.
We'd give anything to make sure that didn't happen.

No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'm leaving early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work on a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and prospects for advancement.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get your driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Is everything settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is yet merely a product of human thought, is independent of experience, so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He risked it.
His wife patched up his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always cranky.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You're getting fat.
They're not mine.
I'm doubling prices.
Could you do that?
A video of an interview was made and published throughout the Internet.
Tom got drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we rest for a while?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do it either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped his muffled breath.
There's a lot of work to be done before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's quick to speak.
It's almost half past three.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Zurich is considered one of the great financial centres.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just in no hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not drag each other out.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I'm getting worse."
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Which one's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a big fight.
That was the drop that spilled the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We would've saved time if we'd gone down Park Street.
A cop arrested him for drunk driving.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife isn't sharp.
We hope people like it.
We all have a price.
That's what gave him the idea.
I got lucky.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Run over any obstacle to this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, texting and e-mailing friends.

Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
As fast as you can, it's cute.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I've barely been able to hide my indignation over her insolence.
Butter's made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss her.
I passed the exam!
Let us help you.
The knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the guts to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
