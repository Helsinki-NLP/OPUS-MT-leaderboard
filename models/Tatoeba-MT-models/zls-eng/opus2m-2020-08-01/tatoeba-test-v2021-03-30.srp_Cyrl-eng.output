You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You failed me.
What is this?
Me too.
That was very good.
She takes care of her old mother.
That can't be true.

Go straight.
Simple as beans.
It's empty.

This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste your words in vain.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?

I pretended not to see.
I was trying to be nice.
Don't come in!
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's on fire.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't say a word!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You're under oath.
I wish I knew.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He's known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?

In this phase of world history, there is not one thing in America like an independent press. You know that and I know that. There is not one among you who dares to write your honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I have received a regular salary to keep my honest opinion outside the papers I work for. Many of you have also been paid similarly for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks would be out there, on the street, looking for some other job. If I had allowed my true opinion to appear only in one newspaper issue that I work for, I would have been fired from work in less than 24 hours. (...)
