Talking in French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This year spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.

Tom didn't say anything about that?
French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your house.
No one else offered to help.
Get your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's the point?
If we could just stop trying to be happy, we'd have a good time.
I forgot his name.
We're in no hurry.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.

What else is in your pocket?
There was nowhere else to go.
The man pushed her aside.
One hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting with a weak expectation.
I hear Boston was nice this time of year.
What's your nickname?

That's too small.
I've never seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was wounded in the accident.

I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in on time if everyone else is late?
The flood of the wind blew the rain directly into my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be happy.

Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is interesting.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I made a list.
I don't bet anymore.
It's my brother's.
That dress is worth the money.
Tom buttoned his shirt.
I don't remember sending that letter.
Why does he look angry?
Tom speaks French.

I don't think you really want to do this.
You seem to have achieved significant success since the last time I saw you.
The station is downtown.
Don't even bother coming.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like the way you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The subject is outside the scope of this investigation.
You sat in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.

How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.

That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to pick up some toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
I don't fit that hat.
What's the minimum wage in the U.A.?
It is on a diet because it is slightly overweight.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?

These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious about Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't teach.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I think what Tom did was really stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language bearer.
I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We immediately became friends.
Tom spent the weekend at his beach house.
Your black is good.
You know everything about me.
Let me think a little bit, and I'll get back to you.
They're interesting people.
Please call from time to time.
Tom, check your pants.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's just wrong.
I forgot your number.
How many wheat does this field give birth to?

He drinks his coffee every time.
I don't have any information on Tom.
She found a job as a typewriter.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should've worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what am I supposed to do?
It is clear that Americans cannot solve even their own problems, so how do they even imagine being able to deal with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a tickle.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was so cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated from American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were so worried sick.
I think you'll be happy.
Teenagers left.
I wish I was rich.
I'm just getting started.
If you need anything, just call.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot of things.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, and I was wondering if my e-mail came to you at all.
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his toes.
His teaching method is both good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a little suitcase.
He witnessed the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing to do with it.
I love parties.
That's the camera I bought yesterday.
Short skirts are out of style.
I think we're gonna need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it one more time.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he's eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
Your green is good.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the coast of the sea.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
As old as you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What will be the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
We can't hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French guilt?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom's sitting on one of the gears.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped outside the old house, and I saw the city one more time.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snoring.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, that's too bad!
The bus has arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned his shirt and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she treats everyone well.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go again at any time.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust the least.
Would you mind waiting outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What kept you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible it's love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom's got two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers across southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that nobody said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'd like to ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everyone jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we haven't known each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than the average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Tom that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national specialities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom threw up blood.
This camera belongs to Tom.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to turn it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it. Come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The sword was delayed for an unknown time.
His brother's learning a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do a lot of people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming from inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom that he's against it.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I deal with him for the price.
You can speak French, can't you?
My father rarely smokes.
His empty attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have an appointment with him at noon.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's way older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
Do you speak French, too?
I just started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom's still living with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom's got little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I'm not gonna be able to get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was taken out of the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twin brothers look exactly alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the smile.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I've got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how long I've been learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's party.
You're not the only ones there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily ever after.
He's mad at me.
This was done by hand by Tom.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
Don't carry a lot of luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given the advantage of the others.
I got you.
Take him with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me publicly.
The pear's on fire.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Turn it down.
What do you say we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all considered that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I'm not feeling well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I'm not blaming you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want; but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking of learning how to swim on vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out that easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered in snow.
One hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Do you mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
He who sows winds will reap storms.
According to data from the latest census, the country's total population is slightly over 7 million people.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left my keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
Think with your head for once.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
Chat-times I think about it.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to submit to their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was so stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I speak to my French employees.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her a piece of advice.
The room was so high, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
Is Spot gone, too?
I promise I'll get it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a helmet.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in force.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I need to get out of here for a while.
You're green.
Pinch your thumbs.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see her?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working in the open.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
They do kitchen supplies in this store.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How do you do it?
I had a good time.
I'll stay the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Did anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been on top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat one live frog every morning and nothing worse will happen to you throughout the rest of the day.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to freshen your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We learn French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please, have patience.
Your joke has gone too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
Everyone's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wished he was still single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me my watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my checkbook.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you around.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In Esperano, the essentials end up in "o." A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is Romania's minimum wage?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is a tough language.
I didn't eat much.
You'll stop thinking about her soon.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at his hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two guys at the same time.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awake at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak in English than in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mix of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
He's staying a little longer.
I like that color.
My grandmother was in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you with Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I've got three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I get a chance to return the favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if there was any pens he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet with Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't the weather great?
I'm not uncomfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You'd better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
That's what his ignorance is all about.
You're absolutely right.
Everybody knows his name.
My French is no good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you pull six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
What club are you in?
Atushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He graduated from Cambridge with a medal.
I have to bring her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom study French at school?
Which shoes are they?
We definitely tried hard.
I'm gonna postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmed up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half of them don't know.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
No problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She has a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've decided on the ease problem.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much is a cab coming out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiased began his worthy endeavor.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
Be more specific.
I'm on vacation this week.
He's washing his socks.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I have no doubt about his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you mind telling me your name, please?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Does he watch your game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time to leave.
She makes makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my eyes nice.
I don't have any money.
Milly eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are demode now.
He's doing very well with children.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, it stopped snowing and the weather was warm.
She's done not particularly light hints about what she wants for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I learn French every day.
I heard every word.
Where'd you get your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you hand me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just walk around here and abuse people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got into a traffic jam and couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom's making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted in vain.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you stupid.
I want to speak French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail costs more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was covered in sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom's not getting any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made Anne a doll.
What'd you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
It's a very interesting story for me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, nobody can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was recently told he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, an afternoon meeting is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about the people behind their backs.
She's a grown-up.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.

I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on which the silk beetles live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.

He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
You really can't swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm getting a gargle out of my gums.
I can't do this alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen rainbows.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the fair.
I thought it best if I didn't say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you looking closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
This restaurant has good food.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.

I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a great poem.
The prices have been down lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the control, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to transfer Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat by the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There used to be a lot of frogs in that pond.
I understand that perfectly.
Depends on the context.

Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.

I can't buy you that dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend of mine is coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope that happens.
Perhaps Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll love it!
I'm afraid I've hit you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's deprived of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put on those shoes, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'm going to study French next semester.

Is there any mistake in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I think of him as my best friend.
No one picked up the phone.
I've seen you before.
You're learning Esperanto.
My new bike is worth 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it until later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so superficial.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel failed because of the earthquake from the last day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.

Close the damn door!

He refused the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.

Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started learning French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom liked to sing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not mean.
I'm a simple office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.

He often walks to school.
The socks stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're tough.
How many episodes of "Wan Pice" have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let go of me.
You're cute and sweet.
My sister lives next door to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
My intention wasn't like that.
I need to get out of here for a second.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, a lot of please-- spray a little insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.

I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried it this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this toilet.

Will you respond?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the best friend of the man, inside the dog is too dark to read.
It doesn't work.
My mother made me a very nice sex.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some kind of community service?
Are you interested?
Apparently Tom was famous before he published that album.
The Romans would not have had a chance to conquer the world if they were first required to learn Latin.
I paid 50 bucks.
Don't drink that.
I think it's best to get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clean the table already!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
Bees make honey.
Tom won't admit he doesn't know how to do it.
I'm the only one who knows them.
In this city, they've been getting iron for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting postage stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have a fever.
Did anyone ever tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do this.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of person would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting, brushed her back in the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good on you.
I've studied French for three years.
I think you should get out now.
Please go away.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
I never heard Tom speak French until yesterday.
She's French.
Soldiers are used to dangers.
I know some French.
Please write down your contact address here.
Bon appétit!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
You gonna make it?
The police found a body dumped on the shore not far from here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about it.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor's slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You shouldn't tell your parents that thing.
Let's face it, man!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land belongs to Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add annotations.
He's not here yet.
Muahahahahahah, your soul will be mine!
A lot of my friends can speak French.
He plays well on the guitar.
Have you ever played Maincraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medications right now?
The tree's on fire.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We used to drive.
Can I take your coat?
My father will make me a delicious feast tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom, just close the phone.
You ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept shooting.
There are fewer teenagers working today.
Why am I still hearing this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's readable.
Shoichi's face is pale.
An electric current can generate a magnetic field.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
The tower was broken to dust and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Send her my regards.
Is she your blonde wife, or is she a brunette?
I'm out driving my bike.
The men carried the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to figure out what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't feel like it.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
In spring, the days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad sing in the bathroom.
Singapore speaks English.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired and still went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played to win.
What's in the coffee?
The pear's burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your kindness.
That smell I've felt before.
They're all dying.
I don't understand.
Give me a hammer.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a bookworm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do that.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it's supposed to be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice as big as Japan.
Either you take them, or you take them!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hanger by the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a little celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably find out.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as much fun as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole, called by us the universe - part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a form of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our nearest people. Our task must be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living beings and nature throughout and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I'm familiar with it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this French form?
This local paper shall be published once a week.
I don't know who he is.
It's almost three o'clock.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He's just become a director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What's this thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I'm having trouble with French grammar.
I slapped him over the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open everything?
It's completely different now.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in light brown.
Betty killed him.
Have you started learning French yet?
You can't read French, can you?
Your shirt looks really good on that skirt.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my big brother.
She's become famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you to "dumb."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that makes me nervous.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Tom lives far away from here?
Bad weather didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
My legs are all over the place.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and get yourself a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to find out when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate this for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with your breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom wondered where she spent her childhood, Mary.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took out their guns.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Tom was sweating.
You'd better not go.
I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak in French.
I'd like a blouse that fits that jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's kind of a star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You're always complaining.
The milk is wet.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your connection to him?
The Devil’s custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was, I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have a few calls to make.
Whatever happens, we make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple took a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one home, and I was abandoned all day.
Math is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom's back to get his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom's back home all covered in mud.
Have you actually tried?
Storm stopped the plane from taking off.
Tell me you have good news.
Which browser are you using?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you going to get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run every surrin.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith is charged with a breach of contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked.
Are you asleep, honey?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons normal, please.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
It's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on your robe.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
There was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your travel shoes and don't waste any time.
Why are you here so early?
If he's judging by your great tan, it looks like you spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably snowing tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom may object.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought maybe your feelings had changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will end.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really that hard to speak in French?
When was the last time he was on a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't ready in seven hours, I'll go to a restaurant.
He left me waiting a long time.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I heard about your party.
They have to change their attitude.
You want me to repeat the question?
It's an interesting book.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What's the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to understand when the train leaves.
You have to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there one more time.
It's so stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I pretend I'm working.
She waits until the water boils before she makes tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
They're not likely to come at this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months he would make us all speak French without a hitch.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And not a word to anyone about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in the city.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon on the train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you some sushi.
So much for today.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
You saved a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything seems to be fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awful.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please, give me an envelope.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
The fog kept him from seeing far away.
Anne's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look closely at the wall map.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight on the road and once you pass the light, you're there.
Do what you want.
Some people would certainly ask, why don't we just get our stuff together and get out of Afghanistan?
Take off your socks, please.
I don't waste any ammo.
I'd like to get a picture of you.
Please, put it away.
"What brand is your car?" "It's Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
His wife’s second cousin was a member of the Jewish Governing Council.
Can you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back!
Say hello to Jimmy for me.
I haven't talked to Tom in three weeks.
Stop yakking.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have the intolerance to travel by sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
It's a clue.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a leaf.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name's Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night was an exciting game.
The big jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little goodwill on both sides, our problems should be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed the stairs.
The house we used to live in was torn down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the lighthouse, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever congratulated Pfirsichbäumchen in German?
There's been an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't that be nice?
I don't speak French, I don't speak Greek.
He made it clear he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I want to sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you leaving?
Hanako grew taller than her mother.
That's completely different.
The elephant is gray.
I'm learning French at home.
Don't make so much noise, please.
Have any of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married, and we want to make heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you going to eat that cookie?
I've been working hard for the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
That might be a little burdensome.
Looks like our water's about to run out.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green is Alice's.
Our junk comes together three times a week.
They caught the fox in a trap.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late because of the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Effort is not only a necessity, but a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's eleven.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Do you learn French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You have to use deodorant.
When I stand up to you world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not gonna be a part of this.
You don't seem too surprised.
It's a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get a sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing to speak French whenever possible.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People in general are against war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We learn French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
At school, we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than to listen, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You're not gonna believe how popular Tom is.
Did you do it?
My dad often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't known anything since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
Everyone's hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for your failure to comply, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like toilets in here.
I'm on vacation here.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is considered.
Tom was saved by a random passerby.
The town hall is downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
That's very kind of you to step off your path to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of town that Mary lives in.
It's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both excuses are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.
The round lasted about five minutes.
He was going around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I have to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll sue you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, but what's left to say?
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me far away.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are girl's best friends.
When he was young, his parents died, so he was raised by his uncle.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangements.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is completely automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
It's hard to adopt English.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how this works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. How much Japanese food did he start to like?
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to stress on that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first girlfriend.
Tom teaches me to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find an account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's big sister.
I don't know either of them, or the other boy.
The guests have to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It's been very nice to meet you.
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruits under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the control room.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It might take some time.
I thought you might want to fight back.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happy.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What's he trying to achieve, Tom?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your voice down!
I would never hurt them.
I've studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's foggy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he had been away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were intrigued by Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash in the register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone 20 bucks and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this matter today.
She didn't have much money.
You're sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You shouldn't give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a checkbook.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of words about DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing on impulses.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I've got work Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authority.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it on my own time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He's got to be the head of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I find it awkward.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the museum with a cab.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees were shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
It wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't be with.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use dental floss.
We arrived quickly because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He's recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those goggles are good for you.
What'd you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until it's over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom's not gonna help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
I don't fit this pair of shoes.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Ugurian sentences in Tatebba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't delay the reunion.
I'm ashamed of what I did.
Let's cross over here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need any help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Are you going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity doesn't take care of the environment, the environment will destroy humanity.
No, thank you, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was being rejected by these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't pick him up yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest drawback.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers are out of water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know what reason Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and release this letter in the meantime.
That chicken hasn't laid a single egg lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind that I visited her unexpectedly.
You've got nice lips.
A lot of people are gonna lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He came to me for help.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's on its way.
The moment of glory for Hanshin did not last long. They were quickly removed from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Isn't that going to cause any trouble?
He was angry that he was called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
We're finally here!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I just haven't found it yet.
I need to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the kitchen window for it to cool off.
Happy is that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, that's too bad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good to taste?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into two balls.
It was personal.
Doesn't it interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you dump them?
Tom, how is he going to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the photo of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera belongs to Tom, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me my watch.
Please excuse my delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
You can measure this sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
Until new meetings.
I'm totally exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I plan to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrasse and get off on Zeestrasse.
Laughing is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Preferred".
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarves cast a great shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I'm not going to give in to threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's getting better.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to deliver the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He disobeyed my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's a friend of hers.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone burn a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is tonight your night off?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
We almost didn't have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as a Frenchman.
I think we need to make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really pretty busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little bit of sleep while I was dancing, and I got on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'd like Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking on the wrong path.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind, you.
She took her exam.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes of the exam.
This book isn't Tom's property.
Where was that?
I've got to get him out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's a grown man now.
Let's not fool around.
I'm getting better.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
You ever heard of him?
She washed her shirt real quick.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Is Tom really trying to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter file.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape, riding a bike.
This isn't the end of history yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's take a break under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just shake your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammo.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move in with you.
She's twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That's a good honor.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's running.
They long for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours ago.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw out those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was obsessed with a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say that kind of thing.
He came after you left.
Have you had breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me this before.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you that dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Can you help me translate this?
Tom barely understands anything from French.
It's the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is running a lot of power.
Don't commit to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made the man, and then he made the woman. Then he took pity on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Oh, he's dancing.
Today machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from a flat rate.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticity, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it got stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth pulled last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't cover up how you feel about this.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl is Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't go into the lock.
What is the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom, turn the lamp back on.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes I'm out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so many bad gums, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself, jumping off a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They're headed straight for their goal.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
It pays off all the time.
They arrived separately.
Talking French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being monitored by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking around in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a pencil.
Don't rush me.
I think you should wear a beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like we're being ignored.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another non-alcoholic?
A lot of people share my view of the matter.
The shirt's clean.
Some tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great endeavor at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a vessel that needs to be filled, but a fire that needs to be lit.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
You've arranged the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French a lot smoother than I can.
I'm gonna hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He played while he was walking.
I saw the girl in the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English. I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way of saving you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter out of milk.
How many One Piece episodes have you seen?
I didn't mean that.
I'm taking a break this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom, start the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Cook 300 grams of rice.
Is that not enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
I'm learning French now.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm very busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a winning streak.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The distribution of television has significantly deprived us of our time of reading.
It's gonna take forever to explain everything.
Don't stick it in my closet.
The new Coronavirus is highly contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here off the record.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here till 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me a lot.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people can talk well and others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom left on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I never should have let you do it alone.
Convicted of death.
I've only waited five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsch" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom got his knees cut off.
I'll come with you back to the hotel.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40.
Are you wearing your driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is coming back again.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported a police disaster.
I can't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's not here.
You put your socks on backwards.
We just got word from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What exactly is this about?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
For the third quarter, the GNP exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you even see something out there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as bad as the laziness.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to go to my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He watches TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the race.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't bother us so much.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That won't make Tom understand anything.
Don't forget to bring your kitchenware like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.

He postponed the party.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.

Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?

I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He goes to the movies with her a lot.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was terminated.
I'll be there for you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston that you stayed in last year?
It's a complex problem.
It's 10:00 sharp.
It's raining like a bucket.

He's known as a great poet.
We won't be here in 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I love sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to find out.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest developments in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing that.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it off as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to get yourself a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.

Aren't you Tom?
She seems shy.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, can't you?
I feel like sleeping a lot.
Be more specific.
I was on leave.
No one will know.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his seat belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Are you in debt already?
Can you teach me how to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have any other choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the first name first, then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was a pale reminder of his father's appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't bother them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a man has a drinking problem?
Is there anyone at the station to welcome me?
I haven't heard from him in a few months.
I don't play paint.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
I kind of understand that question.
Why aren't you here?
Tom's the guy who gave me that bike.
We will not fire under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom's a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.

Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you weigh that?
What's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?
I'm not very good at speaking French.
Ask him about the train to the station.
Bill goes fishing during the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works at the wine shop.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at six in the morning.
She makes me feel uncomfortable.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
Stafids are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of possibilities.
We used to drive when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't so bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of the terrible scream made him shake.
Do you have that shirt in black?
It wasn't a party.
Well, you ordered yourself a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took things off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room to worry about.

Did you have fun yesterday?
This sweater costs over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their names.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the shop.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Sweep your shirts before they get all wet.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I took Highway 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We were able to acquire some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We boarded a race in Shinjuku.

You've been drinking since my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's work going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is a comfort.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now it's your service.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to learn French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I was barely dealing with the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But a ball of corn, a Turkish panic, a giddy Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom's planning on enrolling in.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lot of big Lotus leaves.
We firmly believe that when I draw up sentences, the author must avoid succumbing to harmful habits that are present in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely extravagant in the light of the purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move." Make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When's it over?
I feel sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He didn't make it through the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what could happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilos of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that near your house?
Jane filled out one of the applicants.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been a sport my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around.
He's getting cold easy.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'm gonna study Tom.
The train is ten minutes late today.
There's been a silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I do know some French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct a test on the date of the exam.
Maybe he's avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, practically every family has a washing machine.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest?
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I've had a lot of heads.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
He always said hello with a gift.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you have gone?
I think you should see this.
He can read quite well.
Tom's okay, right?
She looked into the paper for a while.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in Arlington Cemetery.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He's going to get to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work hard.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been so hot lately. My favorite football team's going down.
I was easy on the sweet talk.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language bearer.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until there's still light.
Tom got hurt.
His room is a mess.
They take part in their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's going to go.
Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay for three days.
We delayed our departure for tomorrow.
Nature knows no bounds.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You'd better wear a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum, it's in reconstruction right now.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Add this website to "Preferred".
I've got a lot to say on this one.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what's bothering you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
All the efforts of the doctor were in vain and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't at your place last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy this sex.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They built the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been taking my days to French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
It's him, or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing alone.
I play in a group.
The birds sang.
Tom finishes work at 5:00.
Even though Tom left early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
There will come a time when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get to the museum on a bus?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be specific.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: where the gold is, he sets the rules.
The house is haunted.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that isn't forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't give a shit.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty good.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not receive basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of the younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do that.
Whatever you do, you can't force a man to believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioner's down.
You're sitting in my seat.
Is something scaring you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I get nervous thinking about it.
I paid 200 dollars in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I have to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up for a little bit of that watch, and not talking about breaking up with him at all.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we've got enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
I take a bath every morning in the summer.
Button up your shirt.
Read it one more time.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer the grapefruits over the oranges.
This place is worth visiting at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I took your book until I left it, I was always laughing, and one day I'm going to start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's on the round.
I've seen that, too.
The dolphin is a kind of common.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't do drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
Pocket calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed at school, no less than pencil and tire.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You shouldn't wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop yakking.
You can't just walk around and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I borrow money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom runs around like a chicken with no head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He put on his coat and left the house.
Tataba's new website will crawl home-made hyper database, built from the basics of a search engine, and will go to a tatabux-OS server with a tattooal CPU made entirely of tatabi.
Her old man got in the way.
She hated being called a coward.
I love it.
I never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The Crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
I read all Milton's work on vacation.
What do you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Take your time to protect me.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll drive you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden are inhaled.
They made us work all day.
We chose him president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predetermined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This species is endangered.
I think you better lie down.
I like you very much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving in packs.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's a friend of mine.
You're looking at this the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it in.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved tangiblely to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We've finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more in detail?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we should look into things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you'll make a great father.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at 9:00?
Let's sync our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is that a free shop?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
And if I had told you, kel faida.
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It's a long way from human.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not be hasty.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make hasty conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Oh, my God!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you'd like to order?
I found the boy deeply asleep.
She called it what it was.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were ingested by the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Children are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep going.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was out of his mind.
I was counting on her.
Don't look, Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish that Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll make it in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodyguard.
The man eats bread.
He's swimming the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone indirectly sent a message in a bottle, it was just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sent a message in a bottle, the fate of an entire country was on the map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so many problems.
Kids play dojoball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to act human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as possible.
He broke into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
The way he works doesn't show anything he can boast of.
We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.
She slightly pushed the door.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in barberish.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
Then I visited the museum for the first time.
Is she staying at a hotel?
I don't like that jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?
He's an atheist.
I thought you might be mad at me.
I surrender.
I know her very well.
What's in the beach bag that's in your car trunk?
I don't trust women.
He's an atheist.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Don't leave, Tom.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
