Members of the Welsh congregation are concerned that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the assembly are appalled by the proposal to be called the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, such as a member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valizan Parliament.
Members of the assembly throughout the political spectrum are making sure they smile.
A member of the Labourist Assembly said that they were concerned in their group “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means silly and pwp poop.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that their group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed other options.
The Valizan conservative said that his group of "open spirit" regarding a change of name, while noting that there is a small difference between the words MWP and Muppet in the statement.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter “w” is similar to that of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire Order.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on potential descriptors for members of the assembly will, of course, have to be taken by members themselves."
By law of the Governance of Wales Act 2017, the Valizan Assembly was given the authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Valizan Parliament.
For members of the assembly, the Commission chose the name "Welsh Parliament Member" or "WMP", but at the public consultation, the most support was given the option "MWP".
The members of the assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who must present draft amendments legislation within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the performance of members of the Assembly and the creation of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will take part in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their designation.
Macedonians to decide by referendum on change of country name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to turn their country's name into the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote seeks to resolve decades of long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represented the right to their territory and repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on a change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin’s church have been silenced, as the churches in Harlem face problems
"The older people I talked to say that sometimes there were bars and churches on every corner," Adams said.
"Today there is neither one nor the other."
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today.
The bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
In churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and will soon be back at the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium), where people who would not help shelters in the neighborhood would still live.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day will come soon when all these churches will be closed because it is unlikely that people who will move to these condoms will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community, which served in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the direction of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who refused to hire or support the darks.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning a renovation, they ordered a hooking bell.
The name of David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Martin’s, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor people”.
The expert, who raced in July, called them a little different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also stressed that these were the first hooking bells played by a dark-pold musician, Dionysio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he ran into bigger bells.
Mr Merriweather said that he was not replaced at St. Martin’s church.
The church of St. Martin’s has had a complicated story with architects and contractors in recent months; some have brought church laymen and others a bishop.
In July, Zachristija, the administrative body of the parish, consisting of laymen, wrote to the bishops to worry that the bishop would "try to transfer the costs" to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about transparency by the bishop.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old during lobster hunting at the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he and his group swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just thrilled that he caught the lobster and then realized he was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a whole key tore apart.
"I cried out to everyone to go out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a few weeks earlier in this area had been spotted by a shark, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper hull.
They have disabled access to the beach Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours to Swami’s beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s coming to Boots, Supercompanions and Debenhams with beautiful cats as they have in the store, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while the sale of clothing and household appliances will be tested in 11 stores around the country and in several shops next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used to use for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twisterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing supply of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also receive more space in areas with brands similar to those in shops such as Boots.
Supermarket is also reviving its ludicrous offer of cosmetic products, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the Fireplace Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury stores. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will open at Sally Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
In view of online shopping and the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO at Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores will be similar to wholesale shops, as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with several services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury Group’s has opened outlets of Argos in hundreds of shops and also in Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and the acquisitions were more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s has undertaken a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company to GBP 125 million three years ago with 281 stores owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
They said Lloyds would play his part in this plan, as they were supposed to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands in four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for counselling.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, which presents a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones "Anger" because Holly Willoughby got out of a job worth £11 million.
The star shows Dragons Dan (Good Business) rages because television host Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a job worth £11 million with his life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company of the business couple was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
"The World War II: The World War II: The World War II".
According to sources, Jones was “anguish” when the golden girl of television admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that because of her new business – worth up to £1.5 million – she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their brand of clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and predicted to double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long - term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw was completely astounding by everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlowe, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this Morning, which is among the most interesting banks in Britain, would cost several million because of large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
In addition, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother, three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
In March, Willoughby founded Truly with Cappo in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president.
In addition, Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become ambassador to the brand M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I’m A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked about media criticism over a comment that some think is "non-presidential" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in like that?
Trump, with his sneering "novel" voice, said:
“I didn’t give in anything.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting, and their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump called it a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see "adequate response" to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions that continue to pressure them.
Trump was much more optimistic in his address.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve their relationship with Kim brought positive results — they stopped testing rockets, helped liberate hostages and brought home the remains of American soldiers after death.
He also defended his unusual approach in his conversation with Kim.
"It can be very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded full scene, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed to a crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, foreign NGOs have been told that they do not need their help in addressing the effects of the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s inhabitants were resettled, they did not declare natural disasters, a condition for sending international aid.
"In a number of cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they did not require international aid and therefore the situation is somewhat complicated," Sumbong said.
The Sava the Children organization consists of a team to travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopus, a representative of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Paluje and determine whether they will allow international agencies to assist.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, the country remains completely unprepared for nature’s rage.
In Aceh, a tsunami shelter was built, but on other shores it is not common practice.
The loss of life was likely contributed by the apparent absence of a warning siren for tsunamis in Paluje, although the warning was in force.
The journey between many Indonesian islands also presents a challenge in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, is heading for Paloo, but it will take at least three days for it to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit presents a problem for Jok's administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces the pressure of long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits late equalization against Chelsea
On Saturday, at Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating the first English league against Chelsea.
Sturridge accepted the Xherdan Shaqiri course well 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal in the back of his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote doorway.
The arrow traveled high above the crime scene toward the right upper corner of the neck.
In the end, the ball came down through the doorman, Kepa Arrizabalage, and fell into the goal.
“I simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always drag it forward as far as I could, so I tried only to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch, I didn't think much about it anymore and simply decided to shoot."
At halftime, Chelsea led 1-0 with a hit by Belgian actor Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the blue man threw the ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly handed out in the middle and ran forward.
Then he gave it nicely through the defense and Hazzard ran into the penitentiary.
Hazzard beat the defense and shot his left foot against a remote doorway through Liverpool's doorman, Alison Becker.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, Liverpool will face Naples in the Groupal League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of earthquake victims and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, according to the State Accidents Agency on Sunday morning.
A representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news conference said that many people were caught in the ruins of buildings due to a 7.5 earthquake.
The Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 p.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and was arrested for suspicion of murder by a 32-year-old male.
The police are calling on everyone who's been in the area who's seen or heard anything they're making a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at the initial stage, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to come into contact with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage to get in touch with us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police officers are informing women's parents.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The tenants were now told that it could take several hours before they could enter again.
The police heard him explain to the man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying "it's so awful."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
All those who have any information ask to write at @MerPollCC shall call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicating the daily 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest memory target of the "Rewrite History" dispute
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of Puritanism.
However, the company Cromwell Society marked Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside of the Westminist palace would become a target.”
The Ikonoclasm in the English civil wars of Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
The excellent presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Humo Thorneycroft, testifies to a 19th - century opinion and is part of a history of personality, which some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: »Cromwella many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) see parliament as the protector of external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate play is the subject of continuous historical debates.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has created a further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord Protector also deserve celebration and memory."
Murderer pig mutilated a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by the name “Yuan” was found dead with an artery cut and covered with blood near the pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported in the South China Morning Post newspaper on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing for vaccination on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
According to the report, she and her cousin were scheduled to travel from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's pig with a bloody mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig had crushed the farmer to death.
"Brathranche's legs were bloody and dilated," a cousin named "Wu" quoted in the Guyang Evening News newspaper.
Security footage showed that Yuang came to the market Thursday at 440 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned so as not to attack anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering serious physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then the woman drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a Oregon farmer in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not offensive, but the taste of blood can act as “a trigger”.
"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown a sufficient degree of respect," he said.
♪ To the southwest of the United States ♪ ♪ because of the remains of hurricane Rosa ♪ ♪ come heavy rain ♪
According to forecasts, hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico and is failing.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As of Sunday, from 5.00 a.m. in the morning, the hurricane 1st category with a wind speed of 137 km/h is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenie, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the low air pressure area is being strengthened, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture towards the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture, which will mix with the low air pressure area, will create abundant rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, the disposal of floods, and the possibility of landlides in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In southwest parts, mainly above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rainfall is expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very thoughtless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into derodes of rivers, and storms will bring local wind and dust in the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
The rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which may lead to a minor delay in the floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical slabs will begin approaching Arizona on Saturday afternoon and Monday morning, and late Monday and Tuesday the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rains will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees difference.
During the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern U.S. will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation.
More than 20 million people on six television networks have seen the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault that was to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, as television stations broke the regular programme due to a turnaround in the last minute: the deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI would conduct a one-day investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had touched her in wine condition and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a rowdy testimony that he was 100% convinced that this didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday’s testimony is to be seen by more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average viewing of CBS television networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that performed the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers who watch the program in the offices.
For a lighter performance, ratings are similar to those in the performance of the final football game or the award of the American Film Academy Award.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
The profession remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
Following a statement by the office of the moderate Republican that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning, the cameras of CNN and CBS television networks recorded how the protesters screamed at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the Justice Committee.
During the construction, he tied up the view for a few minutes, which was captured live by CNN TV cameras.
"I am standing here in front of you," a woman said.
"You think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office had made a statement and added that he would say more at the committee hearing and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the transfer of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate vote.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party of Democrats called.
In part, Flake was convinced of this conversation with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation into the U.S. Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "playing political games" at Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans for exit from the European Union of "playing political games" with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of the British Prime Minister Therese May at a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson increased his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said that the proposal that Britain and the EU were paying customs fees to each other was "absurden entirely".
Shooting at Wade Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the death of an LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball team of the LSU.
According to the police report from Baron Rouge, a 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials posted a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and the police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the battle.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement saying he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
Security is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
A surveyor from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking the special unit for the refugees of the Louisian State Police, the state police criminal laboratory, the police of the South University and the inhabitants of the area for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU team Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, on average, he collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team said that the team was "stranged" and "shocked" because of Wade's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Vulcan vomits ash at Ciudad de Mexico
The ash puked by the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Emergency Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre observed several cases of thunder and earthquake suns.
The pictures on social networks depicted thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of cars in the neighborhoods of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics observed increased activity in a volcano, 72km southeast of the capital, after the 7.1-degree earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters who supported independence faced counter-disputed police units and joined thousands of people with rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised secession vote.
A group of masked Separatist supporters held back by anti-emergency police units were polluted with eggs and metals by powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were fights, and police officers had to use their pendrekas to stop the fighting.
The supporters of independence, who cried out "without forget, without forgiveness" for several hours, faced Protestants who supported unity and cried out "Let Spain Live!"
As reported by local media, fourteen people in the protests received minor injuries.
The year following the referendum of 1 October, which was designated illegal in Madrid and the Catalan separatists celebrated it, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as opposers of secession largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after police attempted to stop voting in the region in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence camped overnight before the elections to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another path.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of becoming independent of Catalonia.
"We experienced one of our best times last year.
I watched my parents cry for happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although narrow victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties supporting independence have been difficult to maintain this year's initiative, as many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or are in custody awaiting trial because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who made a protest with his phone to support the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he will run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"A candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression we have seen with the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men driving into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballinagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. on British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to be shooting at the car with a crossbow.
With Mengai's score, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
He was the only one to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as the coach of the Ibrox club.
The shooting of Dolly Menga took care of the difference, since Gary Holt's team was tied up with the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team thus ran out of victory in the guests in this year's championship, and next Sunday they are waiting for Hearts, who leads on the scale and who are behind by eight points.
Previously on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his series of invulnerability in the six-game division and coach-in-chief Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston wastes its chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led quite before the hit, as they caused a number of problems with their directness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to break through, but he sent the ball over the neck frame, and then Alan Lithgow hit past the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for the guests at the time of the interruptions in the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up an action for Mengai, who fired and struck from the middle of the crime scene.
The Rangers had bigger possessions of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't break through, and the doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
The doorman of the Rangers, Allan McGregor, defended Scott Pittman from his leg, and Lithgow fired another Livingston break in the attack.
The templates continued to come to Livingston's criminal space, but the domestics refused all attacks, two violations — Halkett's offense over the exchange of Glenn Middleton and the hand-to-hand offense — and the judge did not rule.
“Excellent performance” of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingston.
All of them were fine, and they continue to go beyond the expectations on their journey up.
The style of the game and the law have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt needs to be credited for the way he woke the team up since his arrival.
It was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well-placed well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard all the time.
But the Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although Gerard is well - guided, these standards are greatly lacking.
There were no shots on the goal – they only successfully defeated the host's defense once – and this is some kind of wake for the Rangers in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish accession to the EU.
It was discovered in the 19th century that the city of Erdogan was the largest city in the history of the world.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads have prevented the crowd from collecting from the Mosque, but many supporters have been able to get closer to seeing their president.
The opinion was also expressed by hundreds of protesters – many of whom are Kurds – who do not support Erdogan's government and condemn Erdogan's policy and decision by the German government to welcome him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the separation of visitors, which some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others despise as autocrats.
A road accident in Deptford: a cyclist was killed in a car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road road in Deptford, southeastern town at approximately 10.15 p.m. after British summer time.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred only a few months after a cyclist died in a car crash, where the driver escaped, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man so they can inform their parents.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: six guards injured in the incident
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a strictly protected man's prison, reports from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9:30 p.m. after British summer time and is still going on.
Police officers from the Tornado unit were invited to take care of an incident involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A representative of the prison staff said: "We have called for specially qualified personnel to take care of the incident in the prison of HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be taken away by the police and they may be behind bars further."
In the prison of HMP Long Lartin, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison manager was reported to be in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called the police counter-emergency unit to intervene in a serious incident in which the staff attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa paves its way through the southwest deserts and poses a danger of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be late Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Orcan Katrina (1967) was infuriated 60km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Orcans Centre predict 50 to 100 mm rainfall with individual rainfalls of up to 150 mm on Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, 25 to 50 mm of rainfall is expected and individual rainfalls up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Orcan Rosa may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as a dry period is currently taking place in the southwest.
“Arison’s good 40 per cent has at least an extreme drought according to the U.S. drought tracking centre,” reportsweather.com.
The route of Orcan Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of the hurricane on Sunday morning at the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected to reach the mainland in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore poses a great danger to floods.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonor, we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with 250 mm of rainfall,” reported the websiteweather.com.
Orkan Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger we expect from the hurricane Ross or its remains is the abundant rain on the Bajo Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the South-West Desert," they said at the National Orcan Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life - threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and earth’s beaches in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected attempted murder after being found in Somerset by a 16-year-old with stab wounds.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 p.m. on British summer time.
He was taken to a hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area at night, reports police from Avon and Somerset.
The police are calling anyone on their cell phone who may have caught an event to answer.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering the unkindness and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unheard tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered the unkindness and anger" of the democratic party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the convention, and he clearly and emotionally denied the accusations that Christine Blasey Ford had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also witnessed her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage".
"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an extraordinary record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of the Republican electoral participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really trying to run for office," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats on the mission are "resistance and impediment".
The first key procedural vote in the Chamber on Kavanaugh's appointment was scheduled to take place on Friday at the latest, the Republican Party's adviser told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims is increasing.
On Saturday, authorities reported that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami affected by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them carried huge waves off the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when six - foot - dark waves hit the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami was at risk yesterday, people stayed on the beach and didn’t immediately escape, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian accident relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, everything to the ground,” Nugroho explained, adding that he traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Paluje.
Photos from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and mussels surrounded by water.
The earthquake suns continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a number of earthquakes were felt.
In a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy released in a major earthquake is approximately 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of a city lying at the end of a long and narrow bay is expected to increase the size of a tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "expansive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Paloo, in the area of Donggal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely cut off and they have no information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are heading to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pal, but officials say the waves came at the time of the warning.
On the amateur video posted on social networks, there's a sound of a man on the top floor yelling at people on the street on the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall hit the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
With Reuters, they couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquakes and tsunamis caused a power outage that cut off communications around Paluje, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the army has begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic needs of life.
The airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Paluj on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dozebe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard set up shelter from the ponies outside their premises, but saw numerous scenes of desolation on the way.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when assistance groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience would not be allowed to come to Pal.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, overseas funding, stocks and staff assistance are permitted only if the site of the accident is declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered an accident at the level of the province," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "okay, this is a national disaster", we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet."
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Paluje, friends and relatives of the missing are holding back hope that their near wonders are in sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days, and her mother’s body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia’s team of sailing paragliding, trained two missing sailing divers for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, according to Mr. Mandagi.
"As an age in sailing paragliding, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hour when news of the destruction of the Roa Roo Hotel circulated around the sailing paragliding community, he was desperate to send messages to whatsApp competitors in Paluje who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole 26.750 USD while filling the ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee
According to the Newport police report, the thieves stole $26.750 from the Brink security worker’s who filled the ATM in the Newport center on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing for the delivery of money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was employed, another man “draw close to Brink’s employee’s security services from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should call the police in Newport to number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was made on Saturday on Twitter and he wrote: "A creature with the official name Kanye West."
For some time, the 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, which he published in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano Grande, who cancelled the performance for "personal reasons", said the show's creator.
The word is an acronym of his current professional name, and West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you" (e.g. you)," said West at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album to Big Boy.
"So that I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means “one”, I changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
This year, Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and with capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to use military force against civilians, just as the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
At a time when leftist student movements began to operate in Latin America, 300 people were shot and killed at peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and to provide students with monthly subsidies and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal societies.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it spends on research in this area, the real investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"Doubleing the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the US, Lee told CNN in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (SuperCile of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order) published Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American player Othello, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and Chairman of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous technological competitions of the American government, such as the robotics competition organised by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US must work hard if they want to receive state support, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes over the best academics, it's these companies," Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the best with universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other governmental organisations to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow board of artificial intelligence.
This month, the DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians to decide on change of country name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum whether they would turn their country's name into the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would solve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 % absent as long as it is necessary for the referendum to be in force.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's collapse.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be free to live under the auspices of the European Union because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission has announced that there have been no irregularities reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a constituent from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, in Strumica, Macedonia, submitted their votes for a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on the change of the name of the country that would pave the way to NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurosian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO will bring a much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his ballot was submitted.
He added that a positive result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that the referendum would take place between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
A second survey conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma showed that 57 per cent of respondents would vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, electoral participation must be 50 % plus one vote.
A failed referendum would mean the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy to take office last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City overplayed Brighton's entire defense and hit
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in winning Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguer's 65th minute shot looked ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentinean attacker accepted a podium in the middle of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defense player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
With his first touch in the criminal space, the English attacker returned the Aguero ball, which beat Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is dealing with problems in his legs," City Pep Guardiol coach told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to hit the goal at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the blues the initial advantage of the first English league duel.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
The ball on the left gave Leroy Sane a nice hand.
Sane touched the ball a few times and then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote doorway.
The blue-blue attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it went off naked.
On Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Synsheim, Germany, will meet Hoffenheim in the Groupal League of Champions.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies and spoil their title options
The Nationals team has dropped out of the final, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the finals, as in the West League the game takes precedence over the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
On Friday, the Rockies won 5:2 over the Nationals team provided the least invitation to the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Even though we can't gain anything, at least we can play in a great atmosphere before the great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?”
The names of the first metalman for Sunday have not yet been published with the Nationals, but in this case it is likely to be a metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal for 34th time, is on Thursday metal as a discharging player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-wing man gathered 18 wins and 7 losses in the season with an average of 2.53 and 300 outages in 220 2/3 of this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really trying with the candidacy, so I am fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They are determined to take power again, using all possible means. You can see shame, wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to wander to gain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and impediment".
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said, and called the Democrats “worried, mean, low and false”.
He named himself a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait, wait. It was really a bad body rumor, the worst I've ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When an activist named Momentum told me in my local client, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of members of Parliament from a Labour party who are not eager to express my opinion.
My colleague, Commissioner Joan Ryan, happened similarly because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was about a non-confidential proposal for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
In the eight years I am a member of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Today, most meetings do not use such tones and promises of a "friendly and gentler" policy for a long time if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that the different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and each opinion assesses whether this is acceptable for customer leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, whom I previously thought we shared similar political views, expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would never agree with - to be in the field of national security or the single market of the EU.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks calling for non-election, condemning the policy of the middle and telling me that it shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I am about to make are political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who face the flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not let themselves be afraid.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become something quite common.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn explained that a labor party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every proposal of a non-confident or a revision of the rules for the choice of parties becomes more narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to put my head down and not be so loud, but I will be “all right”.
But I didn't go into politics for this.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, this has been the reason for the negligence of the Tatcher Government, which is why my primary school classroom literally collapsed — as a local councilman or government minister, I have tried to advocate better public services for those who need them most.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused about my political views and areas I disagreed with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party at a time when the state is sailing against the Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of election or political suitability will turn me away from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unbeated Ayr to the top of the scale
Two known experiments have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a victory in this wonderful entertainment championship game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale and they're the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, the scale on the home page was exceeded by their top defense and better at taking advantage of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for contentment.
"We have been through a lot of tests in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to the Ayra team, the opportunities were used better than we were."
In the 14th minute, by Frazier Climo, Grant Anderson was led by Ayr, but the yellow card for Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, which he received in the game with Warriors, meant a number of strengths for Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted an attempt without conversion.
At the time of the violation, Climo increased the leadership of Ayr before he won at half-time and then converted a stand-alone attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at the time of his death.
But Melrose very well began the second half and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
It was followed by a lengthy interruption due to the serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried away on the stretchers, and following that, Ayr progressed with the attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned Clima.
The temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspore then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with the unconverted attempt on Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing the Climate without a ball, MacPherson scored in the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe intercepted the shot of David Armstrong and sent a winged actor, Gregor Henry, in the fifth attempt by the hosts.
Star of Still Game series begins a new career in hospitality
The Star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously a guest, at least it's supposed to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a longtime partner in comedy Greg Hemfill.
Two of them announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, the director of Adriftmorn Limited is.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested for the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to join the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
»The sea is ours«: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings contain a sea blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicak to Amazon are covered with slogan: »We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of shore in a bloody conflict due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as is the yearning for the re-floating of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the international court to receive it on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit expects the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court on large national screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, which insists that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Here is Morales, Bolivian charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations for Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for the benefit of Bolivia — and even if so, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant the Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken for Bolivia, but they might cost her a lot.
"The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has sucked all the good will that may have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the debates.
The state hasn't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually fast decision.
On Monday, he will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the "end of 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea has declared that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.
The United States called on them to keep their promises made at the meeting between the leaders of rival states in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when American Minister Mike Pompeo was apparently ahead of the relaunch of the dead-point nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
He says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the forecast of the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
D.C. is careful when attaching the forecast without the first adoption of decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, the general doubt arises that Pyongyang is serious about the failure of the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
On fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest line of huge covers that come to a shop with affordable brands in your vicinity
If you want to complete your collection of covers or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to look forward.
In their spring and summer collections 2019, the designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the fashion runway a collection of strange overcovers that blinded the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The very unpractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine’s piece, which was the most exited, was a beige hat with wide ends decorated with feathers similar to those in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other excessive fashion accessories included watermelons with expensive stones, a witch’s hat, and even pineapples — but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colourful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to the masks of Hannibal Lecter than the high fashions.
One creation was similar to breathing equipment and glasses, and the other looked like a cornette with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
The fashionables assume that the giant covers will come to the store near you.
The broad hats are closely followed by “La Bombi”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter cuts was observed at Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for an extremely impractical hat that flooded the social networks sent another large creation through the fashion runway — a straw bag for the beach, which was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit she wore.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, bordered with raffia bars and white leather handle, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus for spring/spring 2019 at the Paris week.
Stylist of famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the store for next summer – because the designer has made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is crucial for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results in the exams, which are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS, are seeking to ensure the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career and the city they hold as global citizens.
As an education sector, which can design and implement a tailored school programme, we can see that modern languages are still popular and desirable electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation is in his memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, his words are intoxicated in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results show that the languages at the top of the scale with the highest levels of performance in independent schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language have achieved an excellent rating.
The data collected in 74 schools of members of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of the students reached excellent grades in Mandarin, and an excellent rating was received by 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young ones will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in independent school curricula and elsewhere as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that for the reasons that employers are struggling to fill their jobs, 17 percent can be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly urgent in preparing young people on their future careers.
In future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If one learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great privilege in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 Youth Survey, which included more than 4000 adults in the UK, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak foreign language well enough to be able to talk, with French being the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of respondents, which is 15 percent.
Investment in language learning is therefore important for children today.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always be able to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country and should therefore also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "International Communication Skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish independent school world
LeBron will debut in the Lakers uniform in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who look forward to the first performance of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the wait will soon be over.
The coach of the Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in Sunday's opening pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton explained on the official Lakers team website.
The official reporter of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
"I don't need a match before season at this stage of my career for preparation," he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of conventions in his campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled conventions in the next week, including stops in favour of him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the loss of control of Congress after the November vote.
At what hour will Trump's convention in West Virginia be held, and where will it be possible to see it online?
Trump’s convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 19.00 p.m. Eastern time.
Trump’s convention in West Virginia can be viewed live online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about hearings of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, who have become tense on charges of sexual assault, which is why confirmation in the Senate is expected to be delayed for one week to be investigated by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help Republicans who are awaiting important elections in November to get a new momentum.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five conventions were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reported.
“The control of the congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the long season of campaigns,” said a representative of Trump's campaign who does not want to be appointed.
Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, today’s convention in the center of Wesbanco Arena, could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania following the report of West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in public opinion research.
“It is a bad sign for Morrisey that the president must come and raise him in public opinion research,” said Reuters, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team still has the desire to win and keep hope before Sunday's individual fights
After three one - sided games, it may have been the Saturday afternoon duels of two (foursome) who needed this year’s Ryder Cup.
The fluctuating swing is a completely fictional sport concept, but the players truly believe it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the swing gone now?
"They had six points of advantage and now they have four, so this is probably a new momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of leading four points, and twelve more can get them.
But the Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have wind in their sails, and, among other things, they are encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them won three points out of four.
Spieth was destined from the initial blow to the greenery and set a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to become louder and lead to a decisive blow when Thomas and his two points lag behind in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory in the 15th hole accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder's Cup.
Strange, but the charming two Europeans have won four points out of four and are infallible.
Two "Molliwood" were the only one who didn't hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy between them and the noisy audience apparently flows is confirmed by the fact that they are the players who will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal the victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Perhaps both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
"Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly defeated by Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game with Alex Noren.
Because of the buggies and the two double buggies on the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis they couldn't find their way out of.
And on Saturday, the players won't be able to help.
The games with four balls and the fights of two twins are an exception to be monitored closely because of the communication between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of two two have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, particularly on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 a.m. the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe is going to the last day of Ryder's Cup with a nice head start after the Saturday games with four balls and two two fights leading with 10-6 against the United States.
The great couple, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did his best to win two victories over Tiger Woods and to sell four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to win the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, held in the morning games with four balls of power over the sinful American team and led in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in two-two fights where they won two games, but they couldn't make up for the delay.
Jim Fury's crew needs eight points from Sunday's 12 separate fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the pair were called "Mollywood") after the sensational end of the week only the second pair who won four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder's Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they again proved to be more convincing and defeated spent Woods and American recruit Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at moments, but lost 19 out of 29 games in a match with four balls and a match of two, of which seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duels of two doubles and in pair with Henry Stanson by 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris did not go according to the plans of the team of Europe.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they strongly won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two-two fights, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team returned after four points behind, even though Furyk's team only needs equalization to keep the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: Without confidence we will not unilaterally disarm
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that further enforcement of sanctions is causing growing mistrust in the United States of America and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapon.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Body, Ri Jong Ho said that over the past year, North Korea has taken a number of "important measures in a sign of goodwill" such as halting the implementation of nuclear and missile experiments, undermining the city for nuclear experiments and a promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a proper response from the US," he said.
"We will not be confident in the United States of America without confidence in national security and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated the known complaints made by North Korea about Washington's resistance to the gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of gradual measures, his statement was important because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as did Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapon.
Washington also did not give in to calls for the release of strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that we first have to disarm ourselves and step up pressure with sanctions in order to force our targets and even object to the end of the war," Ri reported.
"In the idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees, it is the unrealistic hope of people who do not know us at all.
The problem, however, is that further enforcement of sanctions further deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American president pointed out at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Je In, which took place over the past five months, and added: "If we had discussed the problem of nuclear disarmament with South Korea and not the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have agreed to such a dead end."
However, the tone of Rie’s speech was completely different from last year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the U.S. continental part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump Kim was designated "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he still had a lot of work to do and that sanctions should remain valid until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time frame planned for this, saying: "It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly continued without exceptions until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously accepted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent funding for North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he declared that progress had taken place and North Korea had criticised him for several hours because his demands were supposed to be "gangsteric".
In a meeting with Mun, which took place this month, North Korea committed itself to destroying a missile testing station and nuclear experiment infrastructure if the United States takes "adequate measures".
Kim was told that the "adequate measures" meant the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year's Harvard University course is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course they want to fight the growing macho culture of “all-night” learning, where the strengths are accumulated with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleeping medical professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course that was based on his first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
After the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said, "Why do I know this only now that I am in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was.
This year's first course discusses the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the University's health services, says that they decided on such a course when they found that the students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door of the dormitory home where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep shortages on sports success and the importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of student settlements with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that student behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to learn about these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarette smoking affects their health," added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with the "experience of overnight learning" and adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, due to the lack of sleep, is a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be “secret weapons” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, the brain can also avoid gaining weight because of lack of sleep becoming hungry, making students constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler shape his course. He attended one of the professor's lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student village.
He hopes that in the next phase, postgraduate students will be able to ask for a similar study programme to be completed before enrolling in the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up a sleep alarm as well as awakening. He also wants them to be reminded of the harmful effects of the “blue light” broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause the imbalance of the circadia rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit dives up Gerard's teams
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared team of Steven Gerrard to be defeated by 1 :0.
The Ibrox team has been hunting its first guest victory since February in St. Johnstone Stadium 4-1, but Gary Holt's team has won a second defeat in 18 matches since Gerrard, with his team on the leading team of the Scottish League trailing 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half expired, and the chosen series of Rangers did not give the impression that he was trying to even it out.
With this, Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals, the Hibernian team was left behind.
Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when he was reported to have been hit by an object from the city of guest fans.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the crew, which won Ayr without a problem and took part in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup Cup.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified eleven of Livingston, who had taken away the Hearts week before, and no doubt he was thrilled with how his liquefied team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had higher possessions of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with his first short podium, and then he went after Allan McGregor, but he was tied up in the performance inexplicable and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot by Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite certain that after the race with Steven Lawless, after 15 minutes of the game, a penalty shot had to be imposed, but Judge Steven Thomson would have pushed the Colombian's demands into the potassium.
For the first half, the Rangers managed to put together only two shots at the goal, but not the head shot sent against the goal by Lassana Coulibaly, not the flimsy ball of Ovie Ejari, they did not pose any danger to Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already fully credited for his endurance.
The Rangers failed to cash out another Jacobs extension with a long pass.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared the floor for the simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly during his vacation with a winged actor, Ryan Kent, who immediately proved himself to be a subject of the Morlos, but Kelly effectively escaped from his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingston continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett took care of several podiums in front of the goal.
Holt's team could have increased further towards the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was unaccounted for after the angle.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity to shoot after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit him.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
We represent a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, which is now more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany "Hans" Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity; this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's counter.
In the scientific world, he became a constant, and he also won his place in pop culture, such as "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Male: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: »This is the Geiger counter. It is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect on atoms of radioactivity in materials."
Evans: "Honeys, now they're really answering!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before 63rd birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognise attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify the attack cells and destroy them
As part of therapy, the vaccine learns the immune system to recognise the attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of the patient’s immune cells, which are then changed in the laboratory
After that, “see” protein, which is typical of many forms of cancer, can then be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very stimulating in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify the attack cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of the patient’s immune cells that are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of a number of forms of cancer and then re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute from Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several different types of cancer” including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to getting immune cells in patients who are “teaching” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
After performing at SNL, Kanye West performed a prothromping point with the sign MAGA on the cap.
The public was not thrilled
The film was written in the studio of Saturday Night Live at a strange point, during which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 will be running for the presidential chair.
After the end of the show with the third song of his performance, called "Gost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began his attack on Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
»It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, "How can you like Trump, because he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America long ago," he said.
This time, the SNL broadcast began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player was infuriated from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue wasn't played, but it was uploaded into social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of West.
The West also complained to the audience that he had some problems in the background because of the inscription on the hat.
»After the stage they came after me.
They told me “don’t go on stage with this hat”.
I've been harassed!
And they say I am lost," he said after reporting to Washington Examiner.
The West continued: “You want to see the lost scene?” and added that it must put on “Superman’s cloak because this means that no one can command me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
His comments were prepared twice by the audience to whistle and members of the SNL team were in obvious embarrassment, and someone also said about Vanity: "There was death silence in the studio."
At the last minute, West was invited by a goat replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The song "I Love it" was written by the song "I Love it", which was used as a costume of a bottle of Perrier mineral water.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being RAJI.”
The talk show manager Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply "what is, and that's just fine.
However, I AM NOT going to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, welcomes and disseminates the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we also," she added.
Before the show, rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and from now on will be "a being formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE."
He is not the first musician to choose to change his name. Before him he has already done this to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lyon, but we cannot forget another musical legend: The Prince changed his name to a symbol, then he was an artist, once known as Prince.

Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harrington strongly starred against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his fencing sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero says that because of the appearance of such roles on the screens, young boys often feel that respect can only be earned by hard-livedness.
The magazine The Sunday Times Culture was told that something had gone wrong in his opinion, and he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the period of #JasTudi's movement.
The player, recently married to a 31-year-old teammate from the Rose Leslie Game, admitted to having strong convictions about this subject.
"I am currently seriously asking myself where we made the mistake when it comes to manhood," he said.
“What have we taught men during our childhood about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity by showing very powerful characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose this particular side of manhood?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change that?
Because it was obviously wrong for young men."
In his interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in the recording of any pretense or continuation of the Game of Thrones because he had "closed with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will play the main role of a new performance by True West Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother, the robber.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife because of this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte in the fantasy show, awarded with Emma, the love selection of John Snow's whale character.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases reported from China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual relations, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in this way decreased to almost zero from the Junan Conference in the province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is still increasing annually in China by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV with sexual relations in the Chinese community of LGBT is a very pressing problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination on persons from the LGBT community is still very present.
As conservative values remain in force in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff issued data on Republican senators condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters refused the charges that a member of her staff published data on three American Republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
The L.A. Democrats claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites of the far right.
"Lying, lying and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
These data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Judge, Brett Kanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators finished questioning Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, suggest that the IP can identify the source of publication that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information has been published by one of the staff, according to Hill.
“These unfounded accusations are a completely wrong and pure lie” continues Waters.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are not in any way responsible for the leak of this data.
These unfounded accusations are a completely untrue and pure lie.”
A statement by Senator Waters on the Internet quickly came across criticism, including by former White House representative Ari Fleischer.
"From this denial of a branch of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“This may mean that it is not a proper test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he mustn't be angry.
He can't resist.
And he can't doubt the motive of the one he accused.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the city of Waters in the interim elections, appeared via Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious”, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet had informed "the relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities regarding these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for clues on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the resuscitation of the action comedy Johnny English, which first arrived on the screen in 2003, titled Johnny English and continuing in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satire about how bad we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes up and unusual faces, gets permission to remix the brimstones; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr Bean's ditch and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note to the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveller and an international mystery man who was once played by Atkinson in the already forgotten TV ad for Barclay, leaving behind real chaos.
Although one or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, he was wearing medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were short - lived by his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and unnecessarily unnecessary, especially since "serious" films, such as 007 or Mission, are now impossible without bad news to offer comic elements.
It seems like humor is meant for children and not for so many adult viewers, which is why for me the repulsed occasions of Johnny English are not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's silent sketches as Mr Bean.
The constant theme now seems to be that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the British most secret agents' web network and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing major problems to a competent agent represented in a surprisingly small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the point of fracture for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a break because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has made an effort with the role of alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script to help herself.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are exposed and therefore has to choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny Englisha, now a teacher at a respected school who informally teaches how to act undercover: here are the screenwriters who hit because English performs some kind of spy "rock academy".
Englisha is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where she meets a longtime associate named Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotype sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is lost quite a bit.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems in the name of the Secret Service of Her Majesty, and meet Fatalko Ophelio Bulletin, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: this is the evil Jason Walt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed in waiters set a fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak onto the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for the virtual reality to get to know the interior of Walt's house, it manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the pleasantness and energy it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can't help but think here: Is the British film Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labourers deny that they plan a four-day working week for the British, with a five-day working week pay.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyna, is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day payment.
The party wants the leaders of the companies to transfer the savings generated by companies due to the artificial intelligence revolution to workers and give them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend on equal pay.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the party's economic plan and plans to put the country on the side of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal we will seek through the customer’s approach to the balance of the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the client.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as it supported the Green Party in its general elections four weeks working week in 2017.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-week working week is not a party policy and the party is not thinking about it."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to rip out the power of the "regardless directors" and the "winners" in the utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current stakeholders in the water companies may not regain their full share, as the labor party could impose “debates” on the basis of alleged injustices.
He also confirmed plans for the inclusion of workers in the boards of directors and the introduction of the Own Integration Funds, thus transferring 10 per cent of the stake in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the show “60 minutes” (“60 minutes”) whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh conducted by the FBI.
The investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised a question as to whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the show “60 minutes” by Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could reveal anything that would make her change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
»I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him when this accusation came, I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, undeniable, unequivocal."
Graham's voice appears to be carved into stone.
"I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change," he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
»And none of those she named could confirm
The case is 36 years old.
I do not see any new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event involving a truly remarkable series of stars and having the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will take part in the Grand Trato of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizens Festival is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocate group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "acts" such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their objective of poverty-relieving.
But how successful is the Global Citizen movement, which remains for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to take action, or is this just another example of the so-called "clyptivism" – to create a belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation by signing an online petition or providing tweets?
The Global Citizen Movement states that since 2011 more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters have been recorded in the effort towards a range of different objectives.
He says that these actions helped world leaders to make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 would affect more than 2.25 billion lives.
In early 2018, the group stated that the fruit of its activities was to be 390 commitments and messages on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that so far the funds have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the power of nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to helping children realise their full potential), which Rwanda promised $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets of Global Citizens' Movement.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as yourself, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition into historical archives,” said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the Food Power Partnership at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out which the United Kingdom called for improvements in the diet of mothers and children, the government announced that it would co-finance the Food Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children through dietary measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizens movement replied: "This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the U.S. Department of the United States for the “blockado” of Russian energy exports
According to Washington Examiner, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East, if necessary.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it is important to warn that the invitation of legal governments) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," I should say.
In the opinion of the official, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can deal with this. The Navy makes sure that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, by preventing Russian energy from running into the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group addressed as "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential is more or less an impact on fuel and their replacement,” he said, marking Russia as “a pony who knows one trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration sought to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it was intended to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump Government, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is the reason why Trump Berlin is supposed to be a "gatherer" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream gas pipeline 2 is worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, an exclusively economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Union of German Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The involvement of a third country in our energy supply means a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Union of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" her candidacy in the US Presidential elections in 2020, a true Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "exactly study" her candidacy for the American president after the mid-term elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which is required by the female leader," The Hill said after the report.
"After 6 November, I will examine my presidential candidacy in detail."
At a meeting in the city house, Warren was embezzling President Donald Trump because "this country is going to lead in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is worrying me terribly," she said.
She has been openly critical of Warren’s role as President of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before the elections, we need an FBI investigation."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren's in 2020 should not stand for the president's position.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Centre/The Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, eighty-eight percent of the Massachusetts voters.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that it has greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of respondents supporting it and 48 per cent opposing it.
Other high-ranking Democrats who would be eligible for the 2020 election are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press report, said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at the meeting to support Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is experiencing after his return, connects me with other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain amount of wound that our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palinova marked her son's arrest as "an elephant in the salon" and said that her son and other war veterans were returning slightly changed, hardened, wondering where the respect for what the fellows and the airmen and all the other members of the army had donated to the state."
Tracky Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstructions of domestic violence and weapons possession in wine condition, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilli police station.
18 federal states and the Colombian District support the rejection of new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of the new US policy, which disowns the right to asylum for victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district mentioned on Friday had filled the court lobby to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The entire name of the defendant in Grace's case against the Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union has not filed against federal policy, has not been published.
She said that she was abused by her partner and "his violent sons, gang members", but on July 20th, the US authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications in the United States come, as countries that are constantly coping with problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy repealed the decision of the Immigrant Call Committee, which allowed unrecorded immigrants fleeing domestic violence, to file an asylum application.
The State Prosecutor of Columbia County, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” states the court’s application.
State prosecutors further stated in the request that a policy denying immigrants the right to enter harms the US economy as it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sessions on 11 June in his policy release.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts take place to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Ris Kusum, when she comforted her hot boyfriend at the evacuation center in the ruined town of Pal.
"Saviors constantly deliver bodies.
It lacks clean water."
It seemed that the townspeople were returning to the destroyed homes that had broken through overpowered things and were trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, rested outside a military hospital in Paluje, where patients were treated out in the open because of the constant strong earthquakes.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think it pushed me against the ruins of the walls," Harris told Associated Press. He added that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard the woman who called for help and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they are safe."
The American Ambassador accuses Chinese "supply" with "propaganda ads"
One week after the publication of a four-sided advert from the official Chinese newspaper in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuses of the American press of spreading propaganda.
The last week, US President Donald Trump mentioned China Daily's paid addition to the newspaper Des Moines Register — the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of involvement in the US congress elections on November 6th, which was denied by China.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials accused Trump of trying to interfere with American federal elections, described as a new phase in Washington's ever-intentioned efforts to press China.
Although advertising is common for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently complicated in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange blows by introducing customs on imported products.
China's return tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to be affected by exporters in federal countries, such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column on Sunday’s betrayal of Officer Des Moines Register, “now it doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions in the Beijing newspapers and no real reflections of the diversity of the opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic pathways, as their shoes are strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused an offer to publish" his article, although it did not state which one.
Republicans lose their election before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several sexual assault charges, will be known in the upcoming interim elections by losing their vote.
The feelings here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politology at Maxwell University of Sirakuzah for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he suspected that the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI would be sufficient at the last minute to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November either," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced MoveOn Group, on Friday, following the report by the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the Senate hallway, when Republicans overseeing the judicial committee decided to continue to support Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the news portal Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will exceed all borders," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told reporters.
"People say they are already strong, and that is true.
However, it could be even stronger, especially between undefined elections in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29, who do not like the president, but do not often vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she detailed her accusations of sexual assault by the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that she could have further republican support for the negative consequences.
“This has become a major mix-up for the GOP,” according to NBC News, former President of the Republican National Council, Michael Steele, earlier last week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the world or the final vote or the oath of Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA Group, who supports Democrats in the elections.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided between whether they believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, a little more supporting the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they believe Kavanaugh for sure or for the most part.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believe that Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flakea FBA, he is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, and at least one of the defendants, Deborah Ramirez, was reported by the officer The Guardian.
Last week before the Senate court council under oath, Ford testified that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, had attacked her in wine.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
Global Internet inventor plans to start a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, inventor of the world web, is opening a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is the company that is building on the Berners Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "to rule the world".
"We decided to do this now," he said about a new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable users to create a "personal data storage store" or POD
This may include contact details, job lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to being Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The Executive Director, John Bruce, says that the idea of the company is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "do not discuss with Facebook and Google whether we could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission."
In Saturday's publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's aim is to "provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next time on the Internet," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Holiday of Victoria’s World War I Cross
For over 100 years, they have celebrated the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the English Church, who acquired it as a fighter in World War I.
The Honorable Colonel Bernard Vann earned his confession on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never knew that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act in which he earned his medal.
According to the report of the officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quintine's Canal on 29 September 1918 "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire of battlefields and machine guns."
Later, he set out against the firing line and led the line forward with the "greatest heroism" and then attacked the engine room himself and struck three members of the squad.
On 4 October 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper just a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of an old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so I was taught humility.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he and his brother laid a crown on the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade" and "to reflect the courage of a true hero in the support that many people will say."
The spirit of mixed martial arts was still up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, Pigs Pepe were given.
Imagine: You were up all night watching the completely sold Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 duels, including six in the main parket, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to make a stand, viewers in the United Kingdom were appalled to find that the transfer had been replaced by the performance of a picture by Pius Pepp.
A lot of people weren't thrilled because he stayed awake until morning because of the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "some kind of sick joke".
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children's programme,” said Dave Schwarz, vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Pip's Pig." Yeah.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are trying to adjust the schedule in such a way that viewers in the UK would be involved in the future.
"When I think about replaying, I think we could work this out," Coker said.
"But then there is the sixth hour of the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages have been exchanged during the switch and not everyone has been nice.
We tried to sort this out; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the government regulation was the real reason.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five fights – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than expected and we counted on it.
It is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “unworthy about sex. ”
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt less valuable than anyone — but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that “not every one of them” like himself was seduced when he entered high school.
During his first talk on Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said that he spoke of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympic Games was reduced.
The regular host of a longtime show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on the first show of Laverne, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to have boyfriends and girlfriends."
He said: "To date these feelings of inadequacy and differentity are the actual thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know about his orientation.
Two-time bronze Olympic contestants became an influential advocate of LGBT rights and appeared twice this year at the Games of the Nations in Australia to invite countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that a romance with a man – American film maker Dustin Lance Black – with whom he met in 2013 – “surprised him.”
Daley married a 20 - year - old Oscar winner last year, but he says that the age difference never meant a problem.
“When you experience so many young people” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic games and three years later his father died – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple adopted the child, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "entire view".
“If you asked me last year, all I had to say was that I had to reach the gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley’s father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had a ticket to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead was I finally had to admit that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and reached a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympic Games in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by his first choice of songs — the study of the musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which still gives him skin chills.
The Desert Island Discs broadcasts at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson is the Saturday Ryder Cup precedent
On Sunday, when American Phil Mickelson plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, he'll set a record, but he'll have to get back into shape so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the record 12th time, was left by Captain Furyk to sit on Saturday fours.
Instead of being at the heart of what was so often for the United States, the five-time winner of the day spent partly as a fan and partly in improving his game in order to fix what he was trying to do.
In view of the fact that even at the top of his career he did not measure the most straight, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow Le Golf National playground, where the long ledge inevitably punishes the wrong blows.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, Mickelson in the ninth game of the week will be dealing with the exact winner of the British Open France Molinari Cup, who, in a leap at the victory in all four games this week, connected with the newest Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals had four less games, had a good start, Mickelson's game could have proved crucial.
Furyk put his trust in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He completely understands the role he played today, patted me on the back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the famous and has made an outstanding contribution to the teams this week.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought it was necessary to do so.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the highest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder's Cup career, which never really coincided with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence in the team is also bringing in some incomprehensible benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and he’s great to have him in a team room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun this week with him, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage can soon be eroded
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in Ryder's Cup.
The young Danec debuted in 1997 at a match in Valderram where the side of which the captain was Seva Ballesteros had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the goal she made a head start only for hair, with a result of 14 --13.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (in the picture) after seeing the class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led to the Le Golf National field by 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the Cup isn't over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on it.
I’ve been focusing on 12 players who are on our side all the time, but we are also well aware who stands on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Excited by the game of his players on the demanding field, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
There's gonna be a game of individuals at the front tomorrow, so we're gonna have to deal with this differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfers' abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to deliver to the players: tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played with their partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turnarounds in the last day, since in Brookline he was part of the winning team before he ended up being a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in the Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, asking him how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, took his players to the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as fast as we saw in Brookline as we saw in the Medina.
When this momentum gets persistent, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We created a proper setup and set up the boys in a way that we felt like we were going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the battle and facing Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I chose this group of boys for this order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said of the choice of individuals.
New German warship rescheduled
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be dedicated to use in 2014 in order to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War, but due to the failure of systems and the rapidly increasing costs will not be available until at least the following year, local audiences reported.
The handover of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the new class of frigate Baden-Wuertemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, says Commissioner Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but an ambitious project is a matter of concern after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing class of Bremen frigate.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-flight missiles and some cover-up technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals — the latest frigates could remain outside the home port for up to two years.
However, continuing delays mean that the war-of-war ships, which are supposed to enable Germany to influence the overseas power, will become obsolete by the moment of application, according to Commissioner Die Ziet.
Last year, an unfortunate frigate F125 appeared on the front page when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the refund are only a little known and the German municipalities have cited a number of key "programme and technical shortcomings" that would make the warship useless if it were referred to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the old Bremen frigates.
It has also proved that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's prospects for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is supposed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has become a problem – including crew training.
This is expected to reach a vertigo of EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from an initial EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy is in fact "defying ships suitable for deployment".
The official said that the issue has been tightened over time because the old ships have been broken down and the replacement vessels have not been provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new survey is being carried out in the property in Scotland, in which they strive to discover how bats use food in hunting food.
They hope that the results will brighten up the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the survey, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will be accompanied by small bats and small bats and brown bats and water bats on the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
In key locations of the property, special camera cameras will be set up to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The professional sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what kinds of things they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, a NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of managing habitats such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined greatly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and the loss of habitats.
The risks are also wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies and some kinds of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, they help themselves more with their ears than with their eyes.
In order to accurately determine errors and obstacles on the route of flight, they use sophisticated echolocation techniques.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, shelter checks and occasional resolution.
The organisation established even the first and only Scottish reserve, specifically intended for bats, at the Troave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says that the property is an ideal territory for them.
"We have an excellent area for bats on Threave," he said.
»We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, the bats are still well known, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats prior to carrying out maintenance work on the property, since the possible accidental destruction of a single bat's maternity plant may cause death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass, or disrupt them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scots head of the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and for many species we simply don't know how well their population is held."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers prepare to press charges against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo named rape charges as "false news" and said that people want to "promise themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for the lawsuit of the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
In 2009, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that she was to be paid $375.000 for the silence of the event.
In an address of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as "false news"
»No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news," the Golden Ball winner said in a camera five times.
“By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is what I do.
I am a happy man and I wish everyone well," the smiling player added.
Ronald's lawyers, according to Reuters, are preparing for the complaint of Der Spiegel magazine for the accusations they called "unacceptable report on the suspicions of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "non-monetary damage to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In documentation filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at the Mayorga nightclub with Ronald, she was supposed to return to the actor's room, where she was anally raped.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell to his knees after that event and told her that he was a “99% good man”, who was disappointed only in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as compatible.
Mayorga also claims that she referred to the police and that the hospital had taken photos of her injuries and later agreed to settle out-of-court because she was “awesomely afraid of revenge” and was concerned by “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement because the alleged event continues to suffer severe trauma.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved to the Italian giant Juventus just before the transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United.
Brexit: The United Kingdom “would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever”
The UK “would regret forever” if it lost the status of the world’s leading car manufacturer, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told BBC that the exit of Great Britain from the EU would temporarily stop production in a plant in Burnaston, near Derby without agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border could lead to loss of jobs without agreement in the event of a taxite.
Last year, Burnaston factory, produced by the Auris and Avensis Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that in the event that the UK exits the European Union without agreement at the end of March, production in our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston factory.
The concern about how the exit from the European Union will, without agreement, affect cross-border trade has been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of peaches.
Toyota's production line operates in accordance with the "right time" principle, with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU coming every 37 minutes after the contract.
If the United Kingdom exited the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could lead to a disturbance at the borders which industry representatives say could cause congestion and a lack of parts.
Toyota in its Derbyshire factory could not store for more than one day parts, company representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately moderated to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity”, he said about the broadcast of Today BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only Toyota, but also other producers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long the production would have been stopped and in the long run it pointed out that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unita Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be relocated, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be moved to the White House on Sunday due to the ongoing struggle against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian pre-election interference, the link between Trump's associates and Russia and the potential President's impediment to the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general and endanger Mueller's independence has been fueled by Washington's rumors for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a listening device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, in the middle of reporting on his intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then declared Thursday at the United Nations Conference in New York, was announced.
Trump said that Rosenstein would rather not be fired, and then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News show on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could happen this week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and we could put him down for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure you are informed.”
Some reporters would object, but Sanders hasn't called the White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
The show host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of meetings cannot be attributed to resistance to the "set-up" of TV reporters, but she said: "I could not deny that they are being set up."
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President has carried out more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding: "We have looked at each other's numbers without telling the source."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists on the President of the United States can turn directly with their question, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
This is what we are trying to do as much as possible and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at your disposal to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with statesmen in guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this week, when he appeared freely and partly bizarrely to the gathered journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister at NHS Scotland regarding the fear of the taxite
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and to wish that the work would continue after the Brexite.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on their exit, as decisions were taken this fall.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of its nationality.
Friends from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
The team's line of support for Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation following a head injury in Saturday's defeat with 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ from The Tennessee newspaper.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury only happened a little before halftime.
“He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there,” said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie on the edge of the field with oxygen before they placed it on a stretcher and took it off the field for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV Channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the details of the type/range of injury are not yet known" and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered five blows together before he got out of the game, which raised his total number of hits in the season to 18 hits.
Foreign customers will be charged higher fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign customers will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new Tories plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increased quantity will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasurer expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher rate of the fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and the money collected will be for the homeless today will be reported by Theresa May.
The move should be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure affordable housing and to increase taxation of people with high incomes.
The increased quantity will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and additional money will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The charge – which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and broadcasting properties – could be no less than three percent.
The treasurer expects to collect up to GBP 120 million a year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-citizens of the United Kingdom are expected to buy 13% of newly built London real estate, resulting in an increase in prices and a harder purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "souls" as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
A new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The large construction companies have accused price hikes by taking the land they are not actually using, and Mrs. Mayevo has called on him to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the British "inhabitation shame."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rents and the completion of forced evictions without errors.
In addition, he wants to give city councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs Mayeva said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my prime leadership to restoring British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create a life.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and for foreign businesses buying home is as simple as for the British citizens of Garak.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage the Scotland Club"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become the manager of the Scotland Club once.
The 42-year-old Scots enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than first-class.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St Mirren took him back to the Scotland Championship in the last season.
"I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I received a B cap, and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsbound broadcast.
“But I grew up to watch Scotland often as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if you were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletic team, who had already rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Towne, says that as heir to such great names he had not felt fear.
“The success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’.”
According to the structure and capacity this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The path there is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could take it again."
Ross has only done the job of manager for three years, after being assistant manager in Dumberton and for 15 months he was part of the coaching staff of the Hearts.
Alloi then helped prevent the third league from falling out and St Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real turning point," he remembered taking Alloa.
»I was truly convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounded funny because I had a good time as an actor, and I had a relatively good time, and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a lot of things to face every week.
This, in terms of stress and pressure at work, I still face it, but management just feels like the right thing to do for me.
I always wanted to run a club and I'm doing it now. In my whole adult life, I feel more comfortable."

Research results: ideal time for beer is Saturday at 5:30
The summer heat has increased the revenue of the struggling British pubs, but the pressure on the chain of restaurants has also increased.
The groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA, who prepared the data, said: “Sustained solar time and participation of England in the world cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern than in June in the past month, when the income of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, only that the restaurants were affected even more.
The decline in transport in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased further.
The traffic in pubs and drinking bars increased more compared to the turnover in restaurants.
As a result of the sun’s weather, sales in pubs, which offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as restaurant managers, have also been reduced.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over one month and food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for free time and hospitality RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
In the course of the sale on the catering market, time and impact of major social or sports events remain the greatest factors.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the drop by 4.8 per cent at the annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of restaurants with long hot summers could not come at a more irregular time and only time will tell whether the need for recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2,7 % in July, indicating the slowed introduction of brands.

One in five children has a secret account hidden from their parents on the social network
Research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account hidden from parents and teachers on the social network
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has strengthened fears about publishing sex related content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account for parents
One of the five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - create an account on social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about publishing sex related content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they manage a censored "main" account, which they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
The mother, who happened to run into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter invited visitors to rape her.
The survey carried out by the Digital Verification UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and half of them recognise that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle was the most decorated Scottish athletes on the ground and outdoors and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of its extensive experiences at international level in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are confident that athletics in Scotland would gain a great deal by joining the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals at 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to speak after a transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work has been arduous, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I practice agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad comparing mothers with cows has distributed online opinions
The company that manufactures breast pumps has divided the opinions by a commercial comparing mothers with cows in milk.
In order to start the marketing of the “first silent transmission chest pump”, Elvie consumer technology company has published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedoms that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a barn filled with haystacks, to a song that includes the following: "Yes, I draw, I don't see any tail," and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my sessions, these are my tits."
The collection continues: "Deplete, deplete, feed the babies, deplete, deplete, squeeze the breasts."
But the ad that was posted on Facebook's website has caused considerable disfavor online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it was a joke at the expense of the milk industry's "huge".
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they get pregnant and grow up to produce milk, but their children are stolen from them in the first days after the anchoring," one wrote.

The second commented: "Of course it is traumatic for both mother and cub.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?«
Someone else added: "Advert completely without feeling."
The other ad was praised, with one of the women admitting that she thought the song was "for dead fun".
“I think that’s a genius idea.
I'd buy it myself if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was drawing.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
This is a genius product,” she wrote down the second.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who wear out their milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, keep the child and even outdoor activities while drawing milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, commented further. "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation."
By drawing parallel between women who draw milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put into the spotlight milk extraction and all its challenges, and in a fun way to connect women, we wanted to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first case when the Elvie station came to the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children walked on the model track for the designer Martha Jakubowski when using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has risen greatly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to surrender to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid that they would endanger their own chances of staying in the country by applying for a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to print fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official of the Agency for Immigration and Customs, testified before the convention that ten people had been arrested by the agency who asked for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household sponsors are illegal in the country, and many of them are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albenca.
In order to address children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in a court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will appear with a video conference call, not personally, to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those considered not eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escapes, according to shelter workers and reports in the system in recent months.
The defenders said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where the signs of the child’s distress are likely to remain undetected because of their size.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without being emotionally prepared or given them the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends, entangled in the trauma that many face.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In an address by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home even though there was a war going on in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will also act accordingly".
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he told the assembly.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, "almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "to fight this holy battle until we clean the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, the United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers who primarily train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem said that the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and accused "some Western states" of "expanding unreasonable fears" that convinced the refugees to stay abroad.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They are changing the political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive recovery funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major footing of the rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and voiced hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from Fronta Nusra linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be "rooted".
The United Nations Ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and to press the way to the elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to "the review of the members of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will achieve second term
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency ends early in interpretation and scandal.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of the presidency anytime!"
So far, there are no signs of the tiredness of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings have doubled more than twice as much to 1.05 million and MSNBC's ratings are almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, more than four years ago, when it was 1.7 million, and the show "The Rachel Maddow Show" on the MSNBC channel has reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers with night news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designed Survivors”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys Kapitol.
Nell Schovell, a renowned writer of comedy and author of the book "Only Funny Parts: and a few hard truths about snooping in the Hollywood Boys Club," offers a different explanation.
Remember the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
In chaos is a fun value.
Of course, contrary to what it looks like on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, six hours of looking at the round table of experts discussing the use of the resource "from a deep background" for the book "Strah" Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of leather jackets (“a dress that is thickly inflated” said The Washington Post) and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trumpov, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria the same again.
“The part of his start, which gives the impression of reality broadcasts, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show “Pown Stars” about the exercise of Trump's show and the daily swings of the script (a duel with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai at 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC when he recorded CNN.
He couldn't tear himself apart, not even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
“I remember then we created all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money is being made ready for the closest mid-term parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district sees the flood of money, as two candidates were in the race for the same seat because of the reorganization of congressional districts.
This is recently the newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh, home of democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered in a new 17th district.
The cards were painted new when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge ruled in January that the old districts were anti-constitutional in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district touched the fight to finance the campaign between the main parties' financial bodies, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widespread March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to Democrats.
In the U.S., sanctions against Salvador were considered for China's support, then withdrawn.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry have decided to call the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "a recent decision to cease recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a ministry representative at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered regarding Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140m in US aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on the issue of visas, would seriously affect this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials put off a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus completing reflections on the sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the participants of the conference, which is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three US envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judicial authority, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also supposed to point the investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia to attack the American elections.
If the convention changes its hands, Mr Trump will have to answer before these authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to talk to his constituents again.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not wish to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are its peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to strike against Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia.
We failed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of worship that followed.
This changes the course of history and accelerates or inhibits the unquestioned march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with a number of these fractures right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a lot of trouble since this officer reported that last year he proposed a covert shot of the president and speculated on his inadequacy for this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report by The Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the requested investigation of the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or appointed Supreme Judge despite credible sexual assault and guilty testimony charges?
And in particular, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that will demand Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail on these tests, we have a long winter for democracy.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and told me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastikas.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that winning the Austrians after an impressive remium against Villarreal in Spain will put them in a convincing position at the beginning of this month for the G European League qualification.
The damage to the knee prevented bound actor Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season before the 2:2 remium against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a bouncer for greater achievements.
“This was a deserved point for us, as Villarreal is a strong team,” said 31-year-old.
»We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take a point.
We may be able to play victory in the end, but in general, the rum is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am convinced with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year has undoubtedly been difficult, given everything that's happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor women's sleep due to fear of savings
Despite the clear idea of how to care for respondents, few people discussed this with their family members.
Half of the respondents in the Nationwide insurance survey said that they were discussing long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said that children talk about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t bother to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide’s insurance company.
You can start as follows.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not discuss this with her in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost assessment.
Include the financial adviser: your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of the transition.
Choose a health care professional by establishing a trustworthy person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts respect your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authority of a person for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able to do this on your own.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information down in the action plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?” he asked.
"What medicines are you taking?
"Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready."
In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times with an air rifle
A man who was returning home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was repeatedly shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 p.m. in British time, as a "random act".
She didn't see her attacker's victim.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called on any witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami, which hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, while the number of victims was expected to increase further.
In the case of broken communications, rescuers from the regency of Donggal, the area north of Paloo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 Magnitude earthquake, could not obtain any information.
After the earthquake, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Some key information on Palu and Donggali in Sulawesia:
Palu is the capital of Central Shulavesia, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulaveza and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was struck by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a province that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coast on the northwestern island of Sulaveza.
The regency, the administrative unit below the landscape, was estimated to have a population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulavezi are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, it is also important that nickel mining is done mainly in Moravali, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the mitigation of the consequences of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Palu and Donggalo have suffered tsunamis several times.
In 1938, tsunamis caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggali.
In 1996, the tsunami also affected the northern Donggalo and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake - active Pacific ring, and earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis affecting 14 countries, which killed 226,000 people along the coast of India’s assessment, of which more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes affected Western Sumatra late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumata.
2006: The earthquake of Magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and caused the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of Magnitude 7.6 occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of the Magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of heights up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: The tide of the earthquake was affected by the regency of Pied Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami didn't launch, but the fallen buildings caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the deaths of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held back thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Tracky Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers Police Agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintances, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone out of hand.
The Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Predictary Institute and is in custody under an unsecured 500-dollar guarantee, according to KTUU television network.
He appeared at the court on Saturday, where he said he was "certainly innocent" when he was asked about the defense, the network reported.
The Palina accused three Class A offences, which means that they could put him away for up to a year and punish him with a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one Class B offense, which is being punished by one day in prison and a fine of $ 2000.
Palin's crime wasn't charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in the application of domestic violence and possession of alcoholised weapons in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticized the veteran groups when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
A tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Sulaveza on Friday.
The 7.5 Magnitude earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks have been cut off and the number of fatalities is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the central Shulavesia, located northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
On social media, videos depicting the moment of the earthquake are circulating.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people held back at the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
The U.S. Attorneys in New York are demanding the death penalty for Syfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a rental delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan when he ran over several pedestrians and a cyclist in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical damage, it is written in the notice of a death penalty application lodged in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, the cause of the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the grand jury of Saipova informed the indictment of 22 counts involving eight counts of murder to help blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "severe planning and intent", said prosecutors who described Saip's way as "sudden, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagncco," is recorded in the intentional notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District District District Court issued the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, and in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been killed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saip, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saip told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack by the ISIS videos he looked at on his phone.
The police also said that they required the ISIS flag to be disclosed in their hospital room.
As far as the 22 counts are concerned, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of accepting a plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering of these events," Patton said.
Saip's defensive group had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
We should assign Nigel Farage to the tax negotiations, a true Tory Member
In a protest at the Torys conference today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the human army".
The former head of Ukip said that politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of their own MEPs Therese May suggested that they should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
On a hike in Birmingham, conservative Member Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would “be out by now” if it were Mr. Farage’s secretary for the Brexite.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mayeva in coordinating her deep - division species was also highlighted by Toryks, favored to resign from the Brexite, who joined a separate Brexite protest in the city.
The prime minister is seeking to maintain her plan in the track between the attacks of the Brexite defenders, the Brexite opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels will try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone is at the convention Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) in Solihulu that he "wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr. Farage as his associate and give him the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would be out by now," he said.
This MEP from Wellingborough added: "I'm going to support the Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: "In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that since the 2016 vote, the public opinion has changed: "The thought that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely unreal."
At the meeting there was also a Tori proxytary Andrea Yankees, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Minister President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unloved with our party and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message intended for Mrs Mayeva, she added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that policies should be given a "feeling hot" if they intend to issue a decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to give away the lot and today we're gathered to tell them, "We're not going to let you do this."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the Brexite issue, to feel the heat.”
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has provided us with a win at the Brexite, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud UK."
In the meantime, residents walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two - hour meeting at the city center.
After the group was established, a handful of activists waved with the Tori flags against the brexite this weekend.
The Labour nobleman Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for their security problems in using the client's application after the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus agreement, for a border free trade without barriers, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good brexite," he added.
Warren's potential bid for President's position will be "exactly examined"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "participation in the Presidential City match will be carefully examined" following the November elections.
The daily The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of her future at a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation in order to cope with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of “town Hall”, since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to apply for the post of president.
Warren replied that it is time for "to bring women to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrested after the death of an LSU Sims player in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in the shooting of an LSU ballplayer Wade Sims on Friday.
The police station in Baton Rogue reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11am Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near campus South University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul reported on the 247sports network.
Wade got involved in protecting his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resisting and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 beginnings in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russia's grand prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion's title, and the team tells him to let Sebastian Vettle win.
On Saturday, when Valteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas was well started at the start and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his position in the first two bandages and inviting Wettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to boxing and let Hamilton ride on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes led him into boxing later and left him behind Vettel, but Hamilton noticed after a few driving actions that the Ferrari driver left his affections open and risked that after two defense moves in the third corner he would lag behind.
Max Verstappen started with the last kind of network and was on his 21st birthday in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He then drove most of the game without changing tires because he intended to perform a fast finish, beat Kimi Raikkonen, and take fourth place.
He finally drove into the 44th round in boxing, but in the remaining eight circles he couldn't increase his speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valteri's been driving fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team did a really great job in order to reach first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body rumor.
At Saturday's meeting, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein for insisting that she did not disclose the letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's investigation committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and false".
"The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and false," he said.
"When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, "No, I didn't do that."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer ... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... No, we didn’t,” he added about the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was disclosed in early September — but Feinstein denied that it had come from her office.
“I did not conceal Dr Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose her letter to the Commission,” according to The Hill Feinstein’s report.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential as she asked."
Her denial obviously did not suit the president, who at the Saturday night meeting said: "I tell you, it was a really bad body rumor.
It may not be true, but it was the worst rumor of the body I've ever seen."
In the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president suggested that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, disgustingness, they don't care who gets hurt and who they have to run over in order to break through to power and control," the president said after mediaite's report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for losing in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a Saturday game in Dundee 5-3.
The Giants were led by two goals early on the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie were even for the home page, and then Dwyer took advantage of the Giants again.
He was the only one to win the Dundees before two goals in Lundvald Nielsen were guaranteed.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat the Dundees with 2:1 on Friday night from behind.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three matches.
The first goal in the game was to reach Dwyer in the fourth minute with 3:35 along with the assistant Kendall McFaulla, Beauvilier, who won four minutes later, and was given by David Rutherford.
At 13:10 p.m., Sullivan again took the game home and Matt Marquardt gave it to Cowni for equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' leadership on vacation when he won his second naked dinner at the end of the first third.
The home page was reunited, and Bouchard made up for the remainder with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cawnie and Charles Corcoran unitedly helped Nielsen take the Dundees to the advantage at the end of the second third and take care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team half-time and take care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team on the half of the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller has allowed hundreds of people on board to escape before the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
In the earthquake on the island of Sulavesi, followed by tsunamis, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to be shaken by powerful earthquake suns, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
Although coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in a highly wrinkling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
It remained that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could have taken off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was breaking down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s representative, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to be transported from Balikpapan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are beating when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of fatalities could reach thousands, as the Agency for disaster mitigation in the country said that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutonga is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase as many bodies were under the ruins, and many were unable to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative.
The palace, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves of up to six metres [6 m] high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: »Every minute a rescue vehicle brings bodies.
We're running out of clean water.
Mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, which can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal and spoke to the national army: “All of you are asking that you work night and day to fulfill all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?"After CNN's report.
At the beginning of this year, earthquakes in Lombok affected Indonesia, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesian aircraft crash: Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota, now says they miss one man after they initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a diving plane.
On Saturday afternoon, the company Air Niugini said that a male passenger was missing.
They told the airline that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing.
They did not respond immediately to a call for more information about a passenger such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
At the airline, they said there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday who were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy have reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just ahead of the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
“This is extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that together with other passengers, he managed to get through to the belt stretching water to emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said that the stewardess had panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were nearby repairing the pier had also come to help with the help of the rescue, using an inflatable boat to take people to the mainland before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in the retrial of the man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described how he used his phone records to determine the whereabouts of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the eve of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported the officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "a liar because he was a [my] truck in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The cell phone footage shows that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that in the time of Chambers' death, he erased Chambers' texts, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that a jury was scheduled to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
The hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that hiphop has moved away from its original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make the conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently experienced a resurrection in the United Kingdom with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York's nanny is suing a couple for firing her for a "rasist" message.
The New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatoryly firing her after receiving the wrongly sent message from the mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
A couple deny racist treatment and compares the action with “torture”.
In 2016, Lynsey Plassco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived, found that she was black.
In a message to her husband, she wrote Mrs. Plasco-Laxmann.
But instead of sending him to his husband, Mrs. Maurice sent him twice.
After finding out her slip, Plasco-Flaxmanov, who felt "uncomfortable", fired Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, so she wants to hire a Filipino, reported the New York Post officer.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she and Uber sent her home.
Maurice now asks the court for compensation of USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like this don’t work,” she said about the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s dismissal was reasonable, as they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
No racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said of the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if this happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
When comparing the "immigration" suit, Plasco said that his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to be able to handle someone like this?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings are still pending before the court, the public opinion court has quickly condemned a couple on social networks because of its behaviour and way of thinking.
Publishers of Bear Paddington's stories feared that readers would not connect with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put herself in the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She said that her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little bear toy, would be bitter at the rejection of his work, added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book "grenko-sweet".
Regarding Paddington's bear, which she described as a "very important member of our family", she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man who did not like to boast," she said.
“But because the Bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of him, even if you do not do it yourself.
I think he looked at Bear Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the bear Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the time of landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors made no effort to preserve her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“I received Nad’s call, and he told me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll stay with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping were slowly absorbed and abandoned by her system.
She'd been dying for a while, and it was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit around and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the trial she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I had my head down, and I had tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing female glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to turn others away from taking a life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge are posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which people can turn for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs Humphreys, a friend of Davies's for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not establish eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said his death was a serious trauma for them, but they must process it: "She cut a hole in the whole family.
She's torn us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the beginning of an FBI investigation into air.
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, this might make us even," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world was concerned by the hard-line party stalemate of the »decommand«.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, there are only five weeks left – if Republicans are expected to cut off badly, this will greatly weaken them in an attempt to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned the senators to lobby to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and who presented him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can raise at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring to Mike Pence, Vice President, a breakthrough from the stalemate and election to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean Member said.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Association, Byeong-seug said that 1127 people fled last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and the price hike required by human traffickers.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest limit with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a highly secured demilitarised area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after a June historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the US sanctions to a standstill since then.
"Untrusted from the United States will not be trusted in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr Ri said in an address by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for a job in the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives has named the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he is physically unfit for the Supreme Court's service.
Pelosieva said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of anything else than to call a woman "hysterically" "a woman's Thursday's testimony before the Senate's investigative commission to comment on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh denied the charges of sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost cried out, and he choked on his family and high school years in the debate.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and called the charges against himself "grotesque and coordinated muddying", organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosieva said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he should not be appointed Supreme Judge, since it proved to be biased towards the Democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way he handled Clinton and the Democrats, he was discredited," she said.
Pelosieva is asking whether Kavanaugh will try to file a constitutional indictment if it is confirmed and the Democrats will receive a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
"I will say this – if it is not true to Congress or the FBI, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now," Pelosiev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosieva said that she was as a democratically concerned with the possible Kavanaugh decision against the Act on Access to Health Care or the Roe v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosiev.
And a woman's got to catch him.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of anger spilling, and it can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later, Mrs Steinem.
"It doesn't seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “A woman who was somewhere who was also the director who cried when she was angry, but developed a technique, at the time she got angry and started crying, said to the person she was talking to, ‘I may be sad to you because I am crying.
I am angry.’
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was top-notch."
Tears are partly allowed as a way out for anger because people get them wrong.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office where men prevailed, and I once found myself crying in unspeakable anger, was an event when an older woman grabbed me by my neck — a cold leader, who was always a bit afraid of me, dragging me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to see you so much."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a boat called Monkey Business and had to leave the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president alone.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she told me 30 years later.
“ Seven other candidates participated in the game, and another was the last needed thing at the time.
Someone then named the competition “Snow White and Seven Dwarves”.
Since she joined the campaign last, she was lagging behind in raising funds, so she decided not to enter the game unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her — were dissatisfaction with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and direct herself to voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — so overcome that she began to choke.
“I would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder remembered the media reaction.
"We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
“Is she crying?”
How the US-China War Could Use Beijing
The initial salves of trade wars between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is not over long ago, experts say that the divide between countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the American president, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export products, including solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth USD 200 billion (150 billion), which effectively means the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has always been avenged by equivalent retaliatory measures, lastly by tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to making eye contact with the United States and is unlikely to blink soon.
In order to be able to give in to Washington, China should agree to his demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
However, experts say that if Beijing could make the right moves, US trade-war pressures in the long term could have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic turmoil in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional associate focusing on Asia at the brain trust Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated in more than seven years of the ongoing war.
In an address by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation in the field is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to resuscitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All the conditions are now met to return to the country voluntarily to the refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and their survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the restoration of a desolation state.
He pointed out, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries which sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the match against the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France, to win Ryder's 2018 Cup.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and Ryder's Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems during most of the championship, had to hand over the game to Francesc Molinari at the 16th hole in a couple-3 game in his initial blow.
The Italian golfers Molinari shined through all the circles and became one of four players who had ever since the beginning of the championship in current form in 1979 reached the result of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup the last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European player at all times with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy we won the Cup again.
It's a team and I'm really glad I could help," Garcia said emotionally after European victory.
On Sunday with 2 and 1 in the games of individuals, the staff handed over the American legend of Tiger Woods golf.
“I feel incredibly proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games to play in France, and now he has a career record at the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been working so hard all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who spent the entire championship playing high-level golf.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said, "I'm so proud of these boys, they fought."
We put a little pressure on Europe for a moment this morning.
We failed.
The hat down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, and I'm gonna be working with the U.S. Union of PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get your hat down.
We've been outplayed."
