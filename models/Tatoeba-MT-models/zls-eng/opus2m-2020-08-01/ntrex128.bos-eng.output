The Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about the similarity of the Muppets
Some members of the assembly are alarmed by the proposal to change their title to "members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour member of the assembly said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers van Wells: The Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of the political party's assembly, Plaid, said the group "is not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh conservative party said his group was "opened" on a name change, but noted that there was a small difference between the terms MWP and Mupetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire.
The assembly commission currently working on a draft law introducing changes to the name said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the members of the assembly will, of course, be made by members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in strong support for the appointment of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the commission has given priority to the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give rise to the headaches of President Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over a draft bill on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes on the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the plan of the commission's system.
Members of the assembly will have the last chance to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing state name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece that has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents the ownership of its territory and has persistently opposed its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, see the change in the name as a simple price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells on St. Martin are silent as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There is neither today nor today."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People hang out different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as the executives expect, "and sooner or later, they'll go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help preserve the remaining quarter halls.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community who worshiped nearby has taken possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
In 1939 the fire severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made a recovery plan, they ordered the organ.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these are the first organ in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said that the Church of St. Martin had found no replacement for him.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been brought by church heads and other bishops.
The bishop's administration – the administrative body of the diocese, composed of church heads – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the diocese "will seek to transfer costs" to the bishop's administration, although the bishop's administration was not involved in the lease of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old during lobster hunting in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack took place just seven hours ago by Beacon's Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard a boy cry out for help and then, along with the group, rode to him and helped get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a thrill to catch lobster, but then "he realized he was yelling 'she bit me!'
She bit me!'
His whole clavicle was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'the shark is in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady's Pediatric Hospital where his condition was led as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press address that the shark had already been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper hull area.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becoming a competition with chains Boots, Super Druids and Debenhams to departments of cosmetic products in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough in the beauty market in Great Britain worth £2.8 billion, which is on the rise while sales in fashion and home equipment markets are dropping, larger cosmetic units will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will be extended to several stores next year if they are successful.
Investments in cosmetic products are due to supermarkets finding ways to use the shelves that were once used for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic range by offering more than 3000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees products will also get more space in departments like those in stores like Booths.
Supermarket will also restart its makeup line Boutique by making most products suitable for vegans – something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test sales places in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, in southern London last week, and the second one will open in Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Buying online and moving towards the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the Sainsbury's chain, said that stores will increasingly look like supermarkets in efforts to retaliate with high-end chains of Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened departments of Argos store in hundreds of his shops, and he also introduced the Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended infamous.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a fight over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies in their shops.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281st pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds has been said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products to four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial manager of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an inevitable destination of the beauty market that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "breathed" after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons Dan's star, Peter Jones, is "breathed" after television host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his own 11 million-pound brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and additional equipment, Truly.
The company of this couple is compared to the brand of Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The director of This Morning (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons' Den Peter Jones' star by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new investment contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "breathed" when the golden TV girl admitted, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, in Buckinghamshire area, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant that there was no time left to devote to their brand of domestic and additional equipment, Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and predicted to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would secure her profits over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was startled by everyone involved.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday. It was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products ready for sale in Marlowe headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's host, which is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and home equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby children and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in March as company director.
The couples are going on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become ambassador to brand M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He joked at the expense of criticism he could get from the media for comments he could characterise as "non-presidential" and for a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his funny voice, "The News Reader."
"I didn't give in at all."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see "adequate response" by the United States to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were one step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have great relationships now."
He said that his efforts to fix relations with Kim had brought positive results - by suspending rocket tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that their help is not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of the island of Lombok has been relocated, the state of national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if they should allow international agencies to participate.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for nature's wrath.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen in other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no horn for tsunamis on the island of Palu, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesian pasture infrastructure and not saving money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoko's administration as he expects new elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure because of the long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of street struggles between Christian and Muslim groups, who used machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: The Liverpool Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has inserted a deep equalizing hit against Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to the Premier League by hitting 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge took the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal club while his team was losing 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left side, then dumped it towards the outer pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, turning towards the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over Kep Arrizabalg, who was on the jump and fell into the net.
"It was only up to positioning, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as far as possible, so I only tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturrudge told Liverpool.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 to halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazzard scored in 25 minutes.
In the fifth attack, the attacker added the ball to Mate Kovačić before running from the centre of the field into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into the penitentiary.
Hazzard was faster than defense and ended up near the stand by putting into the net with his left foot past Liverpool's Allison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the Champions League's group phase at three o'clock on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays Videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock Thursday in London.
The death toll of the Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many buried people have been reported in the ruins of buildings that brought down an earthquake of 7.5, which took place on Friday and raised waves up to 20 feet high, said the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, in the Merseyside area this morning.
Forty-four-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of committing murder.
The police called in people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on car control panels, to contact us because they may possess information that is important for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived at the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Meows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The tenants are now told they'll have to wait hours before they're allowed back inside.
They heard a police officer tell one man that the whole area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She kept saying "this is so terrible."
At 14 o'clock, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van next door.
Most of the officers were inside the police cordon watching the apartment building.
All those who have any information are invited to contact @MerPollCC directly, calling 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, citing case 247 of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament became the latest monument in the middle of a "review of history" fight
Its removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, carried out by his Puritan followers in the Taliban's manner.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and "try revising history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character would become a target in front of the Palace in Westminster.
Cromwell didn't order or conduct an iconocombat during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed because of the work of his predecessor Thomas from the last century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell by Sir William Humo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the character many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to protect parliament from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Is this entirely true is the subject of a lasting historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the Middle Ages has shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protectors are also worthy of fame and memory."
A pig killer inflicted deadly injuries on a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man known to have been named Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pig's market in the town of Liupanshui in the area of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining in the Qinghai area, China.
He reportedly arrived with a relative from the neighboring Yunnan district on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with blood around his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a pig weighs 550 libris inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," said a relative who introduced himself to his last name, Guyang Evening News.
The security tape shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market owners allegedly negotiate damages for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
The pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 libr loved a Welsh farmer by his tractor until his wife frightened and drove away.
After the pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitobe told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
Hurricane Ross' remains bring widespread rains to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, hurricane Rosa has weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floods over showers across northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa's first category hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles an hour from five o'clock in the morning of east time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is forming in the Pacific and is moving towards the east and west coast of the United States, as the Rosa tropical storm approaches the Bay of California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, applications and possible desert slides.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfall that will reach 2 to 3 inches per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in southwest areas, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the rapid deterioration of weather conditions and the typical spread of tropical rain.
On foot trips to the desert would be extremely thoughtless at the risk of tropical rains.
A heavy rain in canyons could result in wild rivers, and a thunderstorm, at times, with strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming gap will bring local showers to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of over half an inch is possible, which could cause applications and slippery Augustes.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
A calmly scattered tropical rain will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
In October, major fluctuations of temperatures across the United States may occur as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will again try to accumulate and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a high possibility of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the high court Thursday and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual harassment allegedly took place in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political reluctance continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasting due to Friday's latest plot: a deal Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a week-long investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he was 100% sure that he had been groping Kavanaugh and trying to break up at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company's computers are CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty picking up people who follow the transmission from the office.
To better illustrate, it's an audience similar to that followed by football elimination matches or an Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of 5.69m viewers throughout the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a moderate republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS network cameras recorded footage of protesters shouting at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live feed on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, ‘You have power while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission's hearing.
Cable and television networks had live broadcasts hours later while the judicial commission voted whether to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the appointed next week, to which the minority of Democrats calls.
In part, Flake was persuaded by conversations with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview up to her on the front page of the diary, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU are taking customs duties from one another is "all absurd".
Wade Sims' murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of LSU's death
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, police administration Baton Rouge said.
Officials posted a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB network channel CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wade.
His bail is $350,000, a lawyer said.
The morgue of the eastern district of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and neck.
The department said the merits belonged to the Louisiana police task force, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and residents of the area that helped in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the club, LSU Joe Alleva, thanked the district agency for implementing the law on "treasure and a tendency to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-and-six-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "dangerous" and "shocked" over Wade's death.
"This is what we worry about all the time," Wade said.
The Vulcan casts ashes across Mexico City
Ashes blowing up the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Emergency Protection Centre warned the Mexicans Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased even after 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The center followed more earthquakes and tumbling.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering windscreen cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity of volcanoes located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark the anniversary of a polarising Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special squad of police, threw eggs and powdered paints at them, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, there were clashes with the police who used their pendrekas to fight back.
The supporters of independence have been running for hours "No forget, no forgiveness" and have clashed with the Union's supporters who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local presses reported.
The tensions are still high in the region that has been defined as independence a year after a referendum on October 1st, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence with the vast majority, although turnout was low because opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the polling of violent clashes across polling stations across the region.
The groups that advocate independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we are now in a jam," he said.
Although they took the key but narrow victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that advocated independence have had difficulty holding back the momentum because some of their most famous leaders are in self-intentioned exile or detention, awaiting trial because of their role in the organisation of the referendum, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who used the phone to record a police support protest, said politicians on both sides were fueling a conflict.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in next year's European Parliament elections.
"A candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backdrop of democratic values and repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after multiple car crashes into a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Ballinagard Crescent Street Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from a crossbow.
Menge's 1-0 win for Livingston against the Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menge is to ensure victory for Livingston
The improved Livingstone surprised the Rangers and recorded only another loss for Steven Gerrard at the 18 matches of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was even with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club did not record a single victory in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts, which is eight points behind next week.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in a European League match Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of league victories to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunities against the guests with the lack of acuity
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but his attempt went right past the goal, and then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped to get the ball that Craig Halkett had head-to-head.
The hosts were asked to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free kicks.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
There was a free shot against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created a chance for Manga, who took the ball and hit from the middle of the penitentiary space.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and the goalie Liam Kelly had little problem.
That form continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by goalie Rangers Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow was kicking too wide from another free kick for Livingston.
Crosses were constantly arriving in Livingston's penitentiary space and were constantly defended, while the two pens they sought – one after the foul against the substitute player Glenn Middleton, and the others due to the hand game – were not assigned.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingston – Analysis
Journalist of BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and the score of Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed the expectations on the upward path.
Their game style and players have almost not changed since their return to the top, but the great merits belong to Holt who has been giving energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, until Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell at peace throughout the match.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were from time to time under Gerard's bat, they didn't reach that level.
The final blows were missing – only once they broke through the host lines – and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing NATO allies' relations.
They differed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is a city where the largest number of Turks outside Turkey live.
Police have cited security measures as a reason to block 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect the division in opinions of a guest some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
A car accident in Deptford: A cyclist died in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a traffic road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 British time.
The driver stopped and intervened with an ambulance team, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist was killed in an accident where the driver left the scene, on Childers Street, which was about a mile away from Saturday's accident site.
The London police said they were working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets are closed, buses are rerouted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Hurt in Disturbs · Global Voices
Six prison officials were injured in high-security prison riots for men, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin Prison, in the Worcestershire area, on Sunday, around 9:30 British time and still going on.
A special squad of Tornado officials has been invited to calm down riots involving eight guards in one wing of prison.
Officials sustained minor facial injuries and were given assistance on site
A spokesman for the prison administration said, "We've deployed specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident that is under way in Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that those responsible will be forwarded to the police and could be extended to prison sentences."
In Long Lartin prison, more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden of the prison was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, a special task force was called into prison for serious riots in which the staff was attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be useful in the areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression hits Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa passes through desert southwest areas with her remaining energy, carrying with her the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorology Authority has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will announce rain Monday night.
The National Meteorology Administration in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogolon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these rainfalls will likely benefit because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to US drought control agency, a little more than 40% of Arizona has been hit at the very least by extreme drought, the second highest category,"weather.com said.
First, on its way, hurricane Rosa will lead to a slide on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific, and that's why it'll start to sink.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The showers in the parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a huge risk of flooding.
"The total rainfalls from three to six inches are expected from Bai California to northwestern Sonora, and maybe even up to 10 inches,"weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico with the force of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its lags are the great showers in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the American southwest desert," the National Hurricanes Centre said.
These showers are expected to cause life-threatening floods and apply in deserts, as well as gliding in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. British time.
He's been taken to the hospital, and he's in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are calling for those who have any footage of the events on their cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the plight and rage" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the plight and rage" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the glow, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most real legal minds of our era, lawyers with great achievements in public service," said a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched the appointment of Kavanaugh indirectly as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are trying to "supervise and interfere".
The Senate's first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican party official for CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase.
At least 384 people died, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Pal on Friday when waves up to six metres high (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, taking many to death and destroying everything they've come for.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and they did not immediately escape, and they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster resolution agency, in his address in Jakarta.
"Cunami did not come alone, he carried cars, balvanas, houses, hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800km per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Pal.
Photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than the power of an atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of the long, narrow bay has increased the power of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "volume" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had been torn down.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be more along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Paloo, in the area of Donggal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Donggale, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to threatened areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticised for failing to report that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show a man on the top floor who panics about the coming tsunamis on the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
Earthquake and tsunamis have caused a power shortage that has cut off communications about Palu by making it more difficult for authorities to save their lives.
The military started sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization must have arrived from Donggale in Pal, where employees were stationed in tents erected in the office's yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the road, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the inflow of foreign funds, supplies and people is possible only if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami falls on Pal on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be tempered.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been buried for two days under the ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Ro hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that for hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel spread through the paraglider circles, whatsApp sent desperately to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26.750 during the ATM charge at the Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from Brink's workman who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in a fun complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, said the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time as Ye and has used the title for the title of its eighth album, which was published in June.
There was a change ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to be promoted by his new Yandhi album.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", the author said.
In addition to his current professional name, West said earlier that this word had religious importance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with Big Boy's radio host.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means the only one, to Ye only – which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without cartoons and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore they wouldn't use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to conquer the Mexican people".
The army fired on peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in the field, said the investor and art intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US authorities issued posts on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally lacks an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, announced its plan last year: they aim to be first in the area of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubled funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happens in the United States, Lee said in an interview with the CNN this week.
Lee, whose book "SuperCiles of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the most ranked American Othello player, and was later CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee confessed to earlier technological competitions by the US government such as Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they planned the next competitions where future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"Don't take away Chinese academic leaders, it's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant individuals from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen their efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctors from the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences gives subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, in the United States, the Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to include partners from industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of an Electoral Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation that sought to form a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on state name change
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims their northern neighbour's name is the property of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could jeopardise the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether a minimum of 50 per cent would go to the referendum needed to make the referendum valid.
The voter's question said, "Are you in favour of NATO membership and the EU while agreeing with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliament members have said they will be managed by the result of the vote and that the result will be decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when a total of 66% of voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote because of my children, we belong in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and son Dusko, voted in a Macedonian referendum on change of name, which could pave the way for NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs outside tents that were crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they do not want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring over the necessary investments to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is above 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will vote 'yes' because it is more than 80% of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the ballots were inserted.
He said the result of "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will take part in the referendum -- below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents plan to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would vote yes.
To make the referendum a success, it requires 50 per cent turnout plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense and achieves a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling got rid of Brighton's defenses in the victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at the Ethyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean attacker took the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three defense players, Brighton, before he found himself on an open field.
Aguera was then surrounded by three green uniforms.
He pushed himself around one of the defense players and was faster than a few more at the edge of a goal Brighton.
Then he added to the left side, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first blow in the penitentiary to return the ball to Aguero, who by right-handed diggered goalie Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," City Pep Guardiola coach told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers an initial advantage in the turmoil of the Premier League.
He scored goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's field.
He's wonderfully added Leroy Sane to his left flank.
Sane touched it several times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The sky blue attacker threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.
The city fights Hoffenheim in the team stage of the Champions' League at 12:55 Thursday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Synsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game of advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still out there playing.
At least the Rockies have a direct pass for the 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we're not playing for anything, even if we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams is probably going to be at the highest level compared to all the other ones this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals are still due to announce the initial team for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw in the situation.
Scherzer, who would have been 34th time to start a game, coached on Thursday and will throw on Sundays when he usually rests.
The D.C. right-handed man leads 18-7 this season for the average deserved wounds of 2.53, 300 stand-outs in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh,'s election, as he spoke about the importance of the republican elections in half the term.
"All we've done will be at stake in November.
We are five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – although I didn't actually run for office, I am a candidate because I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using every possible means, seeing evil, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to gain power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a "resistance and distraction" mission.
"And you saw it in the previous four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, evil and dishonest".
He cited a democratic senator and member of the Senate's judicial commission, Dianne Feinstein, by the name of which prompted the audience to be loudly insolent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I am waiting. That was indeed the worst language of the body I have ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour members of parliament who have been said not to be welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement from the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East on Friday reads "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I believed shared similar political views began to expect me to make 180 degrees turns and take views I would never agree with, whether it was a national security or a single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's followed by a series of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, condemnation of the centre policy and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments sent to me are mostly political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a series of sexist or racist insults every day, but do not retreat.
The thing that disappointed me the most in this political era is that these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and with every voice of mistrust or by changing the rules of selection the party narrows down.
I've been given a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been trying to get me to bow my head, be less loud, and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the Prime Minister Thatcher government's neglect that caused my primary school's classroom to literally collapse, I've been trying to advocate better public services to those most needed, either as a local councilman or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused with my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that when the country comes to Brexit that will endanger households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not sent to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that by removing the threat from the party or the political trick, they will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unrepentant Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final score, but there is no doubt Ayr won the deserved victory in this exciting game of the day at Tennent's Prime Minister's League.
Now at the top of the table, the only undefeated of ten teams
In the end, the home team won the victory thanks to superior defences, as well as a large number of opportunities used, and Coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru, good for you, they took their chances better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Naderson in the 14th minute by Frazier Climo gave priority to Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo penalally increased Ayra's leadership before, just before halftime, he achieved a solo attempt to hit a 17-5 score for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose's second half started out well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the stretchers, and below, Ayr increased his advantage by the attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair MacPherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose again used the numerical power with Bruce Colvin's untranslated attempt after a period of severe pressure.
However, the hosts also returned when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card because of the foul over the Clima without a ball. MacPherson achieved touch down from the penalty line behind the upcoming Ayra mall.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow to the penitentiary and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt at host.
Still game star is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the catering industry after learning that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes about and plays along with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
Two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan plans to live after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the daily Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, ocean blue flags are flying.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with slogans: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty."
Across the mainland of Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast they lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict over natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the longing to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the largest in the last few decades while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict by the international court of justice on October 1st after five years of the council.
"Bolivia has caught a rush, in the spirit of unity and clearness, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice verdict on large screens across the country, in hopes that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia and the claim that, after decades of cramping negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also plays a big role in Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is pronounced only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have reversed it.
"The problem of getting to the sea has attracted the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold these negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – is using the issue of exit to the sea as a political crutches.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit to the Pacific," he added.
"A verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not lift nuclear weapons until they trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honour promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicting leaders.
His comments arrived at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be at the border to restart the nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and meeting with Kim Jong Una in North Korea.
Ri says it's just letting go of dreams that the continuation of sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pyongyang in terms of giving up the nuclear arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit of Kim and Trump.
On Paris fashion shows presented the latest lines of huge hats you will soon see on a nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 plays, shadowing everyone in Paris's week of fashion.
Extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the runways.
The most prominent Valentine's play was an over-emphasised hat with a wide feathered edge that swallowed the heads of the model.
Among other glamour accessories are watermelons with decorative stones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had curly lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other one resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you are lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after La Bombe, a straw hat with a two-foot perimeter seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that designed this very impractical hat that flooded the social networks, sent another great creation on the runway – a straw bag for the beach that is almost as big as the model that wore it.
The gassytonrant bag of raffia with reeds and white leather lunch was a prominent detail of Jacqemus La Riviera's collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity Stylisher Luke Armitage said of FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for next summer, since the designer has made such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-named fashion accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of language is essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of extraordinary results on exams, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, selected careers and a place in the society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curricula and programme, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable election object for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands, that's a good thing for him.
If you speak to him in his language, it pleases his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a A grade in the final exam of high school.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received A's from the Mandarin language in the final exam in high school, while 72% of those who learn German, 69% of those who learn French and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish also received A's rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in independent schools programmes, and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that employers cited in the difficulty of filling up jobs is precisely the lack of those who know foreign languages.
Hence, knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in the world of globalisation.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they know another language, they will have a real advantage in the future because it is a skill for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to a Youth survey conducted among more than 4,000 British people in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
As a result, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those used in emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be several languages he will be able to choose from in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages are of crucial importance for the future of the country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see the first performance of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday at a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about the six-game plans during the Lakers pre-season.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of election gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the coming week including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court is awaiting, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's reunion in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours at East Time tonight, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia under live feed on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearings this week regarding Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which it was tense over charges of sexual harassment, and an expected vote in the Senate has been postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the far-reaching goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans achieve a better result in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said the meetings were held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as possible as we enter the election campaign season," Reuters spokesman Trump's campaign said.
Scheduled at Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's gathering could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News reports.
On Saturday, it will be the second time this month for Trump to visit West Virginia, a country in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, who doesn't stand well in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his poll rating," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows combatability to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the fours on Saturday afternoon might be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of the slaughter is a fully invented concept in sports, but one of the ones that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think has the swing right now?
"They led six points, and now four points, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points higher, with twelve more in the game.
The Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there are many things that give them encouragement, among other things the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points of possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last punch and led by his example.
The shouts of the celebration grew louder during his round, to eventually play a key blow for the draw in the fourth match when he and Thomas lagged behind two after two.
His final blow, which won the match with 15 holes, was welcomed by a similar cry, one that reflects the belief that the American team has hope.
"You just have to do your best and take care of your match," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder's Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European couple won all four matches and a game without error.
"Mollywood" was the only couple that didn't play God's punches on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience has strengthened them at the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could win a potential European victory as the sun sets on the fields of Le Golf National Club.
The best thing would be both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergi Garcia, the hero of the four ball game that morning, when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
One god shot and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedes in a hole they couldn't even spring from to the end.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to watch closely because of interactions between couples, advice they give and which they do not give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage over the final day, but this session of four has also shown that the US team has a desire for a fight some suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 a.m. the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's matches in the game with four balls and fours took the top 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, made the first two victories over the indisposed Tiger Woods, increasing the results so far on Le Golf National's field to four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorn fought to return the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States has given more resistance to the four tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points in 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they were perfectly composing and overcoming tired Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, flashed for moments, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to his partner Henry Stanson in the fours tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Yet, Europe did not go according to the plan of this pleasant clear day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tournament set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They fought hard to win 2-1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to later return and defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history has a team come back after four points behind individual fights, although Furyko's side that defends the title is a sufficient draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it seems they could not carry out Sunday's attack.
North Korea reports that "no speech" on unilateral disarmament unless there is confidence
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepens its mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the UN's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good faith", such as nuclear and rocket testing interruptions, nuclear decommissioning and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no proper reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no talk of our first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's resistance to the "phase" approach of denuclearisation under which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the importance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US president and North Korea leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work on "denucularising the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korean security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States does not give up ‘denuclearisation above all’ and increase the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even against ‘an end to war’," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can throw us on our knees is the dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump the US leader spoke of in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "That this problem of denuclearisation is being negotiated with South Korea, and not with the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not come into such an unending position."
However, the tone of Rio's speech differed dramatically from last year's, when he said at the UN General Assembly that shooting the American mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racetate" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea implements denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last for two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must remain strictly and without giving in to implementation until full, final, confirmed denuclearisation is reached."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in an effort to prevent the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompez met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with words that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after only a few hours for making "gangster demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to disarm the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "responsible measures".
He said Kim told him that "responsible measures" required by the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho learning culture "all night long with the help of caffeine".
One academic noted that the world’s leading university students are often ignorant of basic self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medical sleep at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course he considers to be the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to initiate this course was given after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you only telling me this now, in my graduate year?'
She said no one ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
This year's course provides students with the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports performances, as well as improving their overall state of mind.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university health service, said the university decided to introduce a course after students were observed to suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course covers a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of the room in the dormitory and students should click on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of sleep shortages on athletic performances and the importance of routine before sleep.
In the second part of the participants were told that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects there is for you to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride over the "awaken night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the lack of sleep becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and a quality one, should be "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, as the result of lack of sleep moves the brain into a starving regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student in California, helped Professor Czeisler set a course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to pass a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarms in time for sleep and awakening and take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the Circadian rhythm, thereby causing trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goals defeated Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressing defeat in the guests when the Dolly Menga shot down Steven Gerrard's team to defeat 1-0 of Livingston.
The team from Ibroxa wanted to win the first victory in the guests after February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team made Gerard the second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leader of the Ladbrokes League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspiring position of the Rangers never came close to equalization.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, and they were behind the Hibernian because of the naked difference.
The Rangers could face further problems after Linen Judge Calum Spence had to be helped when he was thrown on the side of a case.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that beat Ayr and placed it in the batfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt opted out for the same eleven Livingston players who took points to the Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team was pushing opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston used his time better with the ball.
It was a little short on reaching the goal just two minutes after Menga first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the player in the middle of the field missed a big chance and kicked his ass next to the goal.
The deep free blow by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to kick past the goal, end of the stand.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their last-third game gave out more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have got a pen in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former goalie Ibroxa, Liam Kelly, had no major problems defending the blow to Lassane Coulibaly's head and tamed the shot that led Ove Ejari.
Although the first goal of Livingston in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship of power during the game, no one can argue that it was deserved, if for nothing else, then because of the effort.
The Rangers couldn't fight the deep free kick of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga as a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately yielded the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly came running from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to urge guests to play exactly as it suits them, with long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase its advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was very good at holding up the attack on Jacobs, so that Lithgow would then send the ball around naked from the corner.
The deputy Rangers player, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game asked for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882 on this day 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become a device known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the main resistances of science, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the movie "Korona Coronada" from 1950, in which they played seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, a crackpot!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory
They can thus "see" a protein that is common in many types of cancers, and then re-injection.
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovary of the woman who received the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify the malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their conversion to the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2 and re-injection them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "supports the growth of several types of cancer" including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and the "teaching" of the same as how to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a strong support speech to Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on the SNL show.
Didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was screened in a study during Saturday Night Live after a show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat titled "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
"So many times I've talked to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?
So if I cared about racism, I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
The SNL started a sketch show in which Matt Damon played and in which the Hollywood star mocks the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's judicial commission regarding allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They were teasing me!
And then they say I've collapsed," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "it will wear Superman's cloak because that means you can't order me to do it.
Try love."
His comments caused the crowd to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were visibly ashamed, Variety reported, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio has been completely quieted down."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many by performing a song and hunting it disguised as a bottle of Perriera.
Westa was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not withdrawing from the evildoers."
But show host Karen Hunt tweeted that West was simply "what he truly was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he embraced and spread the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it would now "be previously known by the name of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the rates of Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper named Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lyon, and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to symbol, and then to "artist previously known as Prince".
An attempted murder charge after a person was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast
A 40-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Court for Violations on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the series "The Game of Thrones", Kit Harrington condemned the toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who swings with a sword in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) collapsed on the stereotype of macho heroes, saying such roles on the screen mean that boys often feel they should be rude to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture at the time of #Metoo.
The whale who recently married a partner from the Leslie Rose Game, 31, admitted that he had "a strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I am personally quite troubled by the question – what have we done wrong with representing manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic macho culture because of the depiction of characters representing themselves as men.
He continued, "What is innate and what is a matter of rearing?
What is it they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to fit in with a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think it's actually one of the main issues of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not agree to the presets or sequels of the Game of Thrones after its completion next summer, saying he had "ending up with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Keith will be playing in a theater piece of Sam Shepherd True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in the game of the throne.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this fantastic show that won the emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/side: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change from the previous situation.
In the past, HIV has usually spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of viral blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT is widespread.
Studies estimate that due to the conservative understanding in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Viral transmission is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff published data on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US MP Maxine Waters denied that one of her staff published the personal data of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
A Democratic MP from Los Angeles argues that these claims are made by experts and web pages of the "Ultradesk Wing".
"Lying, lying and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared on the network Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The release of information came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Preservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post related to the Waters office and publishes information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect claims - is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie."
The statement by Waters soon sparked a conviction on the internet, brought by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial exudes anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament needed for a member of the Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he mustn't be angry.
He can't be sassy.
He can't question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who has been running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also appeared via Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they are accountable before the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous for all my staff members".
Screen review of Johnny English again in action – a young spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 by achieving "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with the sequel "Johnny English: Reborn".
Will an ironic autosaly about how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, the ghastly, incompetent Johnny English rubber face has been given a new opportunity to blow something up – with his name more than anything to say that it is a general comic creation designed for territories with cinema audiences whose English is not native language.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre claims of the highest glamour, carries in himself a little Clouseau, a speck of Mr. Bean and a crumb of that guy who played only one note in the theme tune of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also originally based on a traveller and an international man wrapped in a veil of secrets that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclay TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest J's venture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knight's armor and the rotor's knives briefly rang about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission are confidently adding comic elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not for adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's gigs in the style of silent films in the image of Mister Bean.
Now it's a very current topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the horror of agents on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, a pompous and depressed character who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the fall in political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterly played this character designed by the example of Theresa May, but the scenario is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies are compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the smut Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially teaches lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegs when English holds a spy academy in the film's "school of Rock" manner.
Englisha quickly returns to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to be reassembled with formerly overly patient partner Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine has been slightly spent.
So Batman and Robin to blow things up are again at the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and happiness to the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelija Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comic events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, making a mess of sneaking aboard Volt's luxury yacht and English is starting a real anarchy trying to get acquainted with the interior of Voltina's house using headphones for virtual reality.
Obviously, great effort has been made in this final sequence, but no matter how sweet and cheerful, the whole film is made for children.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with any roles for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work for four days a week and be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan for the British to work on for four days a week, but they were paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to transfer the time they save thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would continue to receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "accompanie" the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The move to a four-day working week was approved by the Union Congress as a way in which workers can exploit a changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits into a party approach to economic rebalancing for workers, as well as a party industrial strategy in general."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power out of the hands of the "insane directors" and "professor" in the utility companies.
The plans of the opposition's office also mean that the current owners of water supply companies may not recover their entire investment because laborers could impose "rejections" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and to create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the value of private sector companies to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy speaking for the 60-minute show about whether the FBI's investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and is calling the question of whether an investigation of the Bureau could prompt some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a correspondent for the 60-minute show, Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unequivocal."
But Senator Graham's voice seems to be confused.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a fierce accusation would be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she appoints can't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will bring together tens of thousands of people on the great Central Park lawn who will not only enjoy performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 citizens festival, which was first held, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the abolition of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the Citizens of the World project with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-called "clitiquism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world have claimed that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have advocated a number of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to publish promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements arising from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, a partnership between investors and UK realisers who have promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", vowing that Rwanda will allocate $35m to care for the country's malnutrition, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become a historical footnote," said Ambassador to the Food Powers, Tracey Ulman, live concert visitors to London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced it would finance a project to fund the power of nutrition, whose interventions will touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the often asked questions on their page, which reads "why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world says, "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
But like all great civil rights movements and against apartheids before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, to be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – interior secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of Interior and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that the Russian engagement in Syria – namely, there are legitimate governments – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure, together with our navy, that sea corridors remain open or block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those present at an event organised by the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He made a comparison with Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less composed of the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, saying Russia owns only one asset, and its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after Trump's administration's mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which represents a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin become a "secure" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the pipeline is North Stream 2, which is worth $11 billion and which should double the existing pipeline capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for Washington's bitter opposition to this project are purely economical and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the option to choose suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has sparked a reaction from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Union of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Union of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" presidential candidacy for 2020, said Senator of the state of Massachusetts
State Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at City Hall in the city of Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, transferring the source The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city council, saying he "is taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called for criticism from Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet published on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, poll results released Thursday showed that most of the electoral bodies voted for Warren do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The poll showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48 per cent against candidacy.
Other sound names from the Democratic Order discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was talking about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's support rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after a Monday night incident
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, can be linked to what is happening to other families who suffer the consequences of PTSD and the vulnerability with which our soldiers are returning," she told the public at a rally of support to President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a burning topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added "they come back a little different, they come back tighter, they come back wondering if there is respect against what their comrades soldiers and pilots have given for this country," and all other members of the military.
He was arrested in the town of Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and charged with domestic violence -- assaulting a woman's person, obstructing domestic violence and possession of weapons under opiate charges, according to what Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Administration, said.
18 countries, D.C. supports challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a review of a new US policy that deprives asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts submitted a friendly report to the court in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who dispute this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions that the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was held in custody in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have explained that the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are coming, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
A new US asylum policy has annulled the 2014 Committee on Immigrant Appeals, which has allowed non-documentable immigrants and flees from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The state prosecutor of Columbia District, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and thus the chamber violates the principle," the friendly report said.
Lawyers further argue in the report that the police that prevents immigrants from entering harms the US economy, and that they will likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
In June, State Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their countries of origin for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or for their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on politics as of 11 June.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people around the world face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palo as the death tolls in search of survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Ris Kusum by comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the devastated town of Pal.
"Emergency is delivered to the bodies every minute.
The government lacks clean water."
The residents return to their homes in ruins, search for flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees are overrun.
Some of the injured as Dwi Harris, whose back and shoulder are broken, are stationed outside Palua Military Hospital, where patients are given help outside due to continued strong follow-up earthquakes.
His eyes are filled with tears as he talks about how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of committing "violence with propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four pages in the U.S. daily praiseing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to a paid addition of Chinese daily China Daily to Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the US Congress elections to be held on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marks what US officials have said to Reuters, a new stage in an escalating campaign run by Washington to put pressure on China.
And while it is common for foreign governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where each other is increasing tariffs on imports.
In contrast, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed at exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and formerly longtime mayor of Iowa, who is China's main exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, by placing a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at a kiosk located down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about the problematic economic path of China, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under the firm rod of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to make an offer" his article, although it did not state what the paper was about.
Republicans deter women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with debacle Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts warned that a number of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand by the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue are very intense and most Republicans are already showing that they want to vote.
There is no going back in these things," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article for a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute request to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm down the voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, says in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters cried out "november is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, while Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to persist with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
"People say it's already high, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided women's voters in the suburbs and in younger voters between 18 and 29, who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which detailed the charges of alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts were of the opinion that negative reactions could occur if republicans persisted in their appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Big Old Party," the NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, as saying earlier this week.
"It is not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with the issue and how they treated it," he said for the news channel Guy Cecil, the director of the Priorities USA group, which supports the choice of Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight tendency toward the side of Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they felt the same way about Ford.
Following the Flake initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford, before the Senate Justice Committee last week, testified under oath that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals while attending the party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web network inventor plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform called Solid, whose creator is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to that information.
In an exclusive tweet for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta's intention was "world domination."
"We have to do it right away," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal data store on the network or POD (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on the user who can access what types of information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform, a number of employees of development engineers hired to work on a project and a community of programmers.
As of this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their overnight business models will be completely destroyed.
"We're not asking their permission."
In an announcement Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to secure commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in discussing the neutrality of the network.
Although inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Open Data Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's Cross Celebration Assigned to the Priest in World War I
Celebrating in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was decorated with Victoria's cross as a fighter in World War I was placed in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29th 1918 for the attack at the cities of Bellenglise and Lehaukourt.
But a few days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had won the greatest British military confession.
On Saturday's parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial plate.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploits were awarded.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Queen Canal "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire with battlefields and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the fire line and, with the "greatest heroism", led the platoon forward before he rushed without any help to the Polish cannon and cut three of the military squad.
Colonel Vann was executed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that caused obedience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored for participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get Pepa Pig
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually make it impossible for you to watch the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and was displayed live during the night on Channel 5 Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just as the Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Great Britain were amazed when the transmission interrupted Pepa Pig.
Many were not at all impressed that they stayed up all night until early morning for fighting.
One Twitter fan described this break in cartoon transmission as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is the government's regulation that says that at 6 a.m. the content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, on the transfer issue.
"Pepa Pig," yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about replay, I think we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday, when they will be with us on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a break, there were correspondences and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll cut the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferiored” due to sexuality
The Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
A 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that represented Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly of gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
A regular director of a longtime program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months due to illness.
Appearing as an apostasy on the first Laverne show, Daley said that during his childhood he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of less value and feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, US producer Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 was "surprising."
Daley got married last year to an Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, and said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you experience so much while you're so young," he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple came into play as the parents of Robert Black-Daley's boy in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just that "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead was I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I simply knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life -- swimming in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of first song - Proud by Heather Small - who echoed in it as he prepared for the Olympics and from which he was still trampled.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. British summer time.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he'll play his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to regain form so this won't be an unhappily turning point.
Mickelson, who's playing on the 12th time biennale, Captain Jim Furyk sent on the bench in Saturday's four-balls and four-balls.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time main winner spent a day cheering and improving the range in the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not the ideal choice for the demanding Le Golf National court, where a long irregular terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their games this week in the ninth game with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say more.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes very much in himself.
He's a member of the Celebrity House and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I sure as hell didn't imagine he was playing two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career on the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a mere game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience knows that a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup individual matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a match played in the city of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seva Ballesteros had the advantage of five points on Americans, but ended a competition with a narrow difference of 14-13.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderram, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," said Bjorn, imaginary after watching team 2018, which won the 5-3 score Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win this trophy and that's what the focus remains.
All the time I've been talking, I've focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street -- the biggest players in the world."
Remarkable of the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you test the ultimate possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players - do your best tomorrow.
You're leaving your partner now, and he also has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of these big turns the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in the Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with such a rush, it creates a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We formed our configuration according to that and we prepared the guys so we could try to perform a little magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead a counter-attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in a position like this because I think it can cover all the way," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship on hold again
A new frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace aged warships from the Cold War, but will not arrive for at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship in the brand-new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoted by military spokesmans.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after the delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class that were ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods -- it should be possible for the latest frigates to be deployed up to two years without returning to their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which should have allowed Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time they start to use, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 arrived in the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and return it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "soft and hardware deficiencies" that would make the ship unusable if it were deployed into a combat mission.
Software shortages were of particular importance because ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by crew of some 120 sailors -- exactly half of the number of people who operated the old Bremen frigates.
Also, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy to reduce its impact and restricts the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of the heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the size of ships similar to those used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
Problems related to the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy is in fact " running out of ships that can be deployed."
The official said this problem grew over time because the old ships were written off and no replacement ships were obtained.
He complained that none of the frigates of Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on a property in the mountains of Scotland aims to discover how bats use landscapes in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will follow the ordinary bats and sopranos, and the brown long-sighted bat and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be set up at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employees and volunteers of the NHS will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of bat calls and what kind of calls they do.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser at NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each type uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and what is the best way to maintain the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK decreased significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by works on construction and development, which have a negative impact on bearings and loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical treatment of construction material, and attacks by cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, bed inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a big bat area here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good habitats.
But there's still so much that we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses the importance of verifying whether bats are on the property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother’s litter kills up to 400 females and young women, likely to result in the extermination of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by animals and the law prohibits them from killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers file charges against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges as "false news," saying people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has made charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American named Katherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Supposedly, after that, he paid her $375,000 to keep this incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, who were 142 million in video on Instagram Live, hours after the charges report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports by calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the Golden Ball conqueror said in a camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame by talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "inadmissible privacy doubt reports," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "non-material damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents delivered to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after an alleged incident and told her that he was a "99% good guy" who had been let down by those "1%."
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and that they photographed her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "awesome of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says she's now looking for a settlement to be annulled because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at a time when the attack allegedly took place, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juva for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "grow forever" if it loses its world leader status in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "distressing" is what the UK said about the BBC -- if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at borders in the event Bexit remains without an agreement could cause job losses.
The plant from Burnaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced close to 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain exits the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK producers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on the "right on time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, a break at the border may occur, leading to delays and shortages of parts by industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "accurately calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only to enjoy our current success, but also to take this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but also of other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been an extremely successful series of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the Union Union Union Union Union union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this are closed, they never return.
The government spokeswoman said, "We must present a precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House says
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled by another week" because the fight against candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in elections, ties between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstructions of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby endanger Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been a matter of speaking in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was also talking about sounding to record talks with Trump and the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, amid rumors of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI on Friday to conduct an investigation into one week's Kavanaugh indictments, delaying the Senate's full-term vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News channel Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been established, it could be this week, and could be delayed for another week considering all other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disprove this claim: Sanders has not held a brief address for journalists at the White House since 10 September.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a small number of short speeches were not the result of the "theatrical behaviour" of TV journalists, although she said: "I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerating."
Then she said direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without giving evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much as possible and you've seen us do it over the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace short press talks."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or press conferences when visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the crowded journalists unbridledly and occasionally strangely.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about fears related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express the state's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the costs of resolved EU citizens' status requirements operating in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal were continued during the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this has been a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Friends from across the EU, and wider, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting our patients and communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
Defence team player State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's defeat 31:27 of the Vanderbilt Commodores club, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the field line and simply collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on a stretcher and took it to further interrogation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed his surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/range of injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red uniform, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total shootouts Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged higher real estate fees in the UK
Customers from foreign countries will be charged higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds used to help homeless people according to new conservation plans
This move will neutralise Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Greater taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds annually - to help the homeless
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes in purchase of real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, theresa May will be announced today.
This step will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn, seeking to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
Greater fees will be charged to individuals and firms who do not pay UK taxes, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight sleep in the open air.
An additional fee, which was introduced two years ago in addition to the existing fee, which was introduced two years ago to another property and to purchase for rent, could be as much as 3%.
The vault expects the move to increase revenue to £ 120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy people who do not have UK residence, which is why prices rise, and customers who first buy real estate are becoming harder to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in taxis to help a number of young people get to their first home.
He accused construction firms of holding high real estate prices by buying the first one of land they did not use, and asked Mrs May to give up the quota for affordable houses as soon as possible to break the British "a shame on housing policy".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the suspension of zero triggers.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to the prime minister to restore the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as the worthy British.
The dream of ownership of the house has become too distant for many people, and the inhumane sleep in the open still remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "find ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
The 40-year-old Scots enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeast, currently ranked third in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish prime minister's league last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was on the B-team and that was it," Ross said about the Sportsbound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors, as manager of Sanderland, include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former club chief Alloa Athletic says he felt no unrest because he comes after such big names at such a big club, after refusing to offer the Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this point will be in this "will I be able to return this club to the prime minister's league?"
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the prime minister's league," he said.
"It is not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I will be able to consider myself successful only if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross was only in the third year of his management career, after spending a period as assistant manager in Dumberton and 15 months spent as part of the Harts coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the fall in the third category, and St. Miren dragged off the edge of falling into the lower league to the champions of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirque, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled taking over Allo's club.
"I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management and now I've been doing it, in my entire adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I am now."
You can listen to the whole interview on Sunday, September 30th on the Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. on British summer time.
The perfect time for a cup is Saturday at 5:30, revealing the research
The summer heat wave has increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, there was a growth in sales of 2.7% in July, but restaurant traffic fell by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, from the consulting company CGA, who collected data, said: “A lasting sunny time and longer than expected participation in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as in June, when pubs grew by 2.8%, and restaurants had an even larger decline.
The decline in traffic in restaurants of 1.8% in June only deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinking have achieved a far better result with higher growth compared to the comparable results of the previous period than was the decline in restaurant traffic.
The pubs focused on food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinking sales increased by 6.6% per month, with food sales falling by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for Entertainment Content Analysis and Restaurants of RSM, said: "This results continue with the trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
Weather opportunities and the impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors when it comes to out-of-house sales.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the decline in sales of 4.8% annually will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a bit of the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slower introduction of new brands.

Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from his parents and teachers, reveals research.
Research involving over 20,000 higher-class primary school students revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" order that shows parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, makes demands on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 higher-class primary school students revealed a rapid increase in the "false Insta" order, referring to the site for sharing photos Instagram.
The news strengthened fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said they had a clean "main" order showing parents, but also had private orders.
One mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter has discovered a teenager who calls others to the words "rape me."
A study conducted by the UK's Digital Consciousness and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual assembly of that governing body.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete, and the chairman of Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including 200m and 400m in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC expert, remained immobilised after a transit ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote, "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could show if I would recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A traitor commercial where mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that manufactures traitors has shared opinions on the Internet with an advert that compares the suckler cows to the milking cows.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent traitor", the company for consumer technology, Elvie, published an ad inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that the new pump provides for mothers who betray milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between haystacks and cows with a song that says, "Yes, I'm milking but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not ubiquitous, it's my breasts."
The following is the chorus: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself."
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different audience reactions, while many said it sheds light on the milk industry's "happening" milk industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and be born like us to make milk, but they take their babies away a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't they use it to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else said, "It doesn't make any sense to me."
Others stood in the defense of advertising, and one woman admitted that her song was "breathing".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this if I was still breast-feeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I figured it out right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny commercial aimed at milk - betraying mothers (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and they feel like ‘cows’.
This isn't a praise or milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wire or pipe and stops in the breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out as they betray milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at the company Mother, commented: “Pumpa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between breast-feeding and milk cows, we wanted to put into focus the issue of milk and all the challenges that go along with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time an Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Yakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find guardians for children.
Traditionally, most of the guardians themselves were migrants without documents who were afraid to compromise their chances of staying in the country by coming forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs official, told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not previously been convicted.
"Nearly 80% of people who are either guardians or members of the foster home are illegal in this country, and the good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we'll keep looking for these people, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to get children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules according to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will make a video call instead of personal, to ask an immigration judge for the law of their status.
Those who are found not to meet the requirements will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay closed, the greater the chances of becoming anxiety or depression, which can lead to an outbreak of anger or attempted escape, the shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks have been raised in larger institutions such as the one in the city of Tornillo, where size makes it much easier to overlook signs that indicate that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian country, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at a session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "the war against terrorism is almost over", where more than 36,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "a holy battle until we have eliminated all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly in charge of training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the matter of refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for "expanding irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to make these returns possible," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in the last major rebel uprising in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish accord has deterred a massive attack by Syrian forces supporting Russia in the province of which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and fighters from the Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, which would "be extinct".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee composed of authorities and members of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
Moualem presented the conditions of the government of Syria for participation in the work of the committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, recall and scandal earlier, end his mandate.
This would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic end of the presidential term of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the impact rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to the Nielsen agency, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC has exceeded cable rating with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with breaking news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer drama producer "Selected Survives" on ABC channel, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Schovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only Funny Parts: and several cruel truths about getting into the Hollywood Boys club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos also has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories that come from Washington can decide the future of the Roe v. Wade abortion law, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the state of global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that six hours of watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Strah," about Paul Manafort's jacket of noisy skin worth $15,000 (a suit with a thick display of haughtiness), he wrote Washington Post) and the implications of picturesque descriptions, uh, anatomy, Mr. Trump, given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"The part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and director of the pawnshop show, commenting on the rotation of the cast and daily complications of Trump's show (critical of the American Football League, the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleissa this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of about 80 degrees (27 °C), but he closed himself in and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

A large inflow of money from the side in the most uncertain middle-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
A recent end to the district's suburbs of Pittsburgh has led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who headed the second district since last spring's snap elections.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally formed in favour of the republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a campaign to fund the campaign between the main parties' fund-raisers, the Committee that raises funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broadly watched special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District in March.
That position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little priority to the Democrats.
The United States considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdraws
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the task force management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140m in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would be difficult to hit the central American country with a high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a follow-up to last year's summit that was a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering into the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, and in fact interrupted any review of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
On behalf of Mr. Bolton, the White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing you know, there could be a special investigator Robert Mueller's report on the possible Trumpo obstruction of the judiciary, which now has significant evidence in public files.
Mr. Mueller, according to reports, also directed his investigation to reveal a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's election attacks.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to re-emerge before the voters and perhaps even the jury.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several such breaking points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an invisible position since this paper reported last year that he has proposed a secret shot of the president and expressed speculation that he is not fit to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from the Times is incorrect.
"How are we going to react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in the middle-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump is going to call for responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers are hosting the Rapids in Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after an impressive remy in Spain against Villarrell at the beginning of this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League group.
The injury to the knee has prevented a binding player named Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until an unsolved match with Willareal's final score of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for the next.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and went with the point.
We may have been able to take them all the way, but all in all, the unsolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we went back in second and we were better.
A big European evening awaits us again Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they had a good score in the last game, although with the support of the audience we can certainly push through and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened with my injuries to change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have right now.
The team's in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope we can move on now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep with worry about pension savings.
Despite the fact that the subjects had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with members of their families.
About half of the people covered by the survey of Nationwide said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said they talked about it with their children.
"People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on the subject," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at the Nationwide company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to be provided with him, for such decisions can be a significant factor in pricing.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing choices can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Take care of your legal documents: In the root, prevent legal battles.
Give you the authority to make decisions on medical care so that you have an authorised person of trust who will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the conclusion of a grant agreement for finance.
This means choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and care for paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly parent finds himself in a situation where he needs medical attention and is taken to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with multiple shots from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle as he walked home from his evening out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. on British summer time as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to grow.
As ties broke, relief officers could not obtain any information from the province of Donggale, areas north of Palua that are closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paloo and Donggali, on the island of Sulawisi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawisi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was struck by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a county that stretches over 300km (180 miles) of coast on the northwestern island of Sulawisi.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawisi.
Pala and Donggal have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggali.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is situated on a seismic Pacific fire circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumata.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that rocked the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatre, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake hit the Pydie Jay region in Aceh, causing collapse and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami destruction of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Big earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 people dead, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily captured.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion that he committed domestic violence, interfered with domestic violence and resisted arrest, according to a report published by the state police agency Alaska on Saturday.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit and was granted a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where a plea of guilt has been pleaded "certainly not guilty", the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he's facing a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B violation, which is being punished by a prison sentence of one day and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she related her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
Connections and power supplies have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social networks there are video records showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The federal prosecutors in New York City are looking for a death sentence for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used the rental truck of the company Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to a request for the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
At both points, it is possible to impose a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saip caused injuries, damages and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendose and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," according to a request for punishment.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York City was committed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of release for the admission of guilt, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose a death sentence.
The conservative MP says that NIGEL Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel dissatisfaction" with the eurosceptics, as one of the MPs Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
conservative representative Peter Bonne said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "go out" so far that Mr. Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in an attempt to unite her deep-separated ranks was highlighted by conservatives who advocated staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from the Chequers despite attacks and supporters and opponents Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it proceed with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and laborists to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the Ottawa rally that he wanted to "refuse the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
An MP from Wellingborough said, "I'll fight for Brexit, but we need to get the Chequers out."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
Brexit supporter Andrea Yankees, who also attended the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a strong message to Mrs May, she added, "The Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel dissatisfaction" if they are about to fail a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us -- the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "it won't pass".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel dissatisfaction.
"We're mobilizing the people's army of this country that brought us victory in Brexit and we won't rest until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved "Torijeci v Brexit" after the group was formed this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus" plan, for the uninterrupted state at borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts patriot spoke of her future during a participatory meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, again ran for the November elections against a Republican representative at Geoff Diehl's House of Representatives, who was co-chaired by Trump's Massachusetts campaign 2016.
She's at the centre of speculation so she can face Trump 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electricians using the participatory format of the meeting since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.

Arrest after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La, announced Saturday the arrest of a shooting suspect in which a basketball player, LSU Wade Sims, was killed Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at a press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released, asking for help in finding a man who can be seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus Southern University early Friday.
Wade Sims was shot in the head following what he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson hit him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, owned by a weapon, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge County Police Station.
Junior of 6-foot-6 who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season with 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russia's Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his order guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear on Saturday that the order of the teams would play a big part in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettle to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at the start, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action wheel from a wheel that the driver Ferrari reluctantly forced to leave the free interior at the risk of lagging behind after a double move in defense of the third turn.
Max Verstappen began from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran most of the race relying on his tires to get to the quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a rough day since Valteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team did a really remarkable job to achieve one or two formal finishes," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinsten at a rally Saturday for insisting that she did not release a letter to Christine Blasey Ford in which the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused her of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify to Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, dangerous and lying.
The only thing that could have happened is the wonderful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the posts and the information that's leaked to the public, and then they say Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public- no matter what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let you go public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let...No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- yet Feinstein denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story go public," Feinstein told the board, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come across the approval of the president, who at the rally on Saturday night commented: "Let me tell you, it was really a bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president insisted that Democrats use them for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the evil, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediaite conveys the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday by winning five to three in a back match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants initially took advantage of the two goals of Patrick Dwayne and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie led the domestics to equality before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened it out for Dundee before two of Lucas Lunvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elte League season for the Adam Keef team, which came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth two-party season, and the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwayer opened the match in the fourth minute, 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilier and doubled his leadership four minutes later.
In the crowd at the beginning, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt assisted Cawnie for equalization at 15:16.
By the end of the first period, Dwyer had secured the leadership of Giants with a second goal that night.
The domestic team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in measuring the force with the goal at 27:37.
Cawnie and Charles joined together to help Nielsen bring Dundee to the lead at the end of the second period, and he achieved the fifth goal in the middle of the final period to ensure his team's victory.
Giants, who have lost four matches since now, welcome Milton Keyneses in the next match Friday.
Air traffic controllers lost their lives to ensure hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia declared a hero after he was killed by ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
Despite his colleagues running away trying to save their lives, Anthonyus Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Airport Sis Al Jufri Palu, who was rocking hard.
He remained to ensure the safe takeoff of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was at the time standing on the runway.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transferred to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Paloo.
Our heart is breaking because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state's disaster mitigation agency says the approaches to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Boutong are limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as numerous bodies remain below the ruins, and many cannot be reached," said a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
Waves that reached the height and up to six meters devastated Pala, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: She was driving ambulances every minute of her life.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross Indonesia is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the army of the state: I ask you all to work all day to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota says one person is being led missing, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members must have been evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon they were unable to trace the passenger.
The airline states that in co-operation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators work to find this man.
The airline did not immediately reply to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact sequence of events.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy announced that the plane ended up in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew over the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to make it to the emergency exit through the water that went down to their sinking waist.
He said the crew was panicking and yelling, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked near the dock repairs also helped rescue the inflatable boat that brought passengers to the coast before the plane sank to a depth of about 30m (100m).
Air Safety Network data indicate that in accidents registered in PNG, 111 people have been killed in the past two decades, but none of them were involved by Air Niugina.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution closed the case in a retrial against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Ministry analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he was using cell phone data to make a photo of the whereabouts of defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was received from several phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, carried by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
Asking the prosecutor if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that he claimed that Chambers had met about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett is that Tellis specified time after Chambers died from his phone erased her messages, calls and contact information.
He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to begin on Sunday with a closing statement.
The judge said he expects the jury's trial to come later in the day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and return the popularity of the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons are once again gaining popularity in Great Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing after a racist text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing on a discriminatory basis after getting a text message from a mother who complains she's another black person."
The couple denies being racist, estimating the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plassco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed discontent when she came in on the first day of 2016 she realized that she was the new nurse of children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
NOEA yet another black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and had been expecting a Filipino instead, carried on by the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a one-day fee and was sent home by a pick-up.
Maurice is now suing a couple by asking for compensation for dismissal, as well as a $350 a day fee for six months, to which she was originally hired to live with her family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding that I know it's discrimination."
On charges of racism, the couple returned that the cancellation of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they insulted her they would not be able to believe her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco, his husband, told the Post.
But would you trust your children with someone you insulted, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Qualifying the suit as an extortion," Plasco said his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and had been in a very difficult situation."
You're going after someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behaviour and thinking.
The Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: It is difficult to put in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little stuffed bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with both happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having your kid achieve something and you're proud of him, even though it wasn't really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always credited all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was immediately transferred to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
He regularly called to say it was bad, and they did not expect him to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly stopped working and stopped running through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before that and everything went out.
I could've just sat there and waited, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, boarded a plane along with the other passengers, who did not even dream of what pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I got my head down, and my tears kept running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieved women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the Welsh Bridge are putting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide when he was 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
But before he died, he left work because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people know there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Do not sit down and keep your mouth shut, talk."
Mrs. Humpreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was in a mood, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas, he was at the very bottom, when the children opened their presents he looked them in the eye or anything else."
She says his death for them was a huge trauma, but they have to get over it: it leaves a huge gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we'll move on and fight."

With the FBI investigation opened, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and scope -- maybe that would bring us together," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the board is falling apart" because of the irreconcilable party attitudes.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is caused by choice of moment.
Congress elections are held in just five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans go badly, as expected, their attempts to be elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
On Saturday, George W. Bush phoned the senators, lobbying for support from Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes up your report?
It will vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide and confirm by his vote his appointment as Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of defects from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 defects were recorded last year compared to 2011 when the figure was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs that traffickers charge.
Pyongyang didn't make a public call.
A large majority of the North's defectors will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a firmly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors illegal, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have been markedly improved in recent months.
Early this month, the two countries' leaders met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped denuclearisation talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, with a wider consensus that he would work on denuclearising the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
Without confidence in the U.S., there is no trust in our national security either, and under such circumstances is not taken into account that we are the first unilaterally disarmed," RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court hysterical" and said he was unsuitable for the Supreme Court's service due to his temperament.
Pelosi presented these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted that way hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he talked about his family and his high school age,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, assessing allegations against him by a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" organised by liberals to anger that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform his post in the Supreme Court since it showed his bias to the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if he would try to recall Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi caved in.
I'll say the following -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not just like him in the Supreme Court, but not in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of District Court District Court of Columbia.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrats, is concerned about the possible Kavanaughi rulings against the Law on accessible health care or in the case of Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would alter certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be courted and that we are expected to say if it is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justified anger, anger that's been gathering for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere executive director, who said she was crying too when she was angry, but if she had developed a technique that understood that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed a way to shed anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office where men were mostly, is that when I once cried for indescribable anger, an older woman - a cold boss who I was always a bit afraid of - grabbed my neck and pulled me to the staircase.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad, so they will be glad because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on the Moneky Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she found there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
That wasn't a very well thought out decision," she told me 30 years later through laughter.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had already moved away, it was lagging behind in fundraising, and she swore she would not enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger over chauvinism -- from which she got caught in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my monument.
She cried"?
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonadas of trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is yet to be seen, the dispute between the countries in the long run can benefit Beijing, experts argue.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning early this year by taxing key Chinese export products including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest blow took place this week with new tariffs that hit $200 billion (150 billion) items, which are practically taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has returned each time with the same measure, and the latest one is the introduction of a rate of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the second largest global economy appears to be not going to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to meet the demands, but public worship to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, US pressures in the trade war can positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies in the long term.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a ghastly economic downturn in one of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready" to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in restoring a war-torn country for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas that destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use the help of rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the United States with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National van Paris field, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw a ball into the water at the 16th hole, leaving the match to France's Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinars has brillianted in all rounds, and has become one of four players who has ever made it to 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost to 5-4 Throbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost two to one to Ian Poulter of England, who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European tournament winner of all time with winning 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy we won the Cup again.
Here is an important team and I am glad that I could be of assistance," Emotion Garcia said after a European victory.
He's handing the Staff over to his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods two to one in single matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the best players of all time who won 14 of the greatest titles and is behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team has been struggling all weekend to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there were moments when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup board, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
