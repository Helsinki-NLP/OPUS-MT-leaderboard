It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised he'd help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to our necks.
Tom was pretending he didn't notice Mary watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves stalked the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been up to now?
Tom's a childless man.
I don't live in Boston.
They were suing the government for damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's getting a little yellow in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would've denied the answer.
I'm obliged to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spat on the gum.
I really love your big sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be sassy with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
Who do you usually have lunch with?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop making noises, Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes a ham with eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than take the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom, I wrote this report.
Do they buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Actin' is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Should we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
I run my nose every time I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me like shit in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still cost money.
Tom promised he'd help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't exactly love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
Tom is obedient, even obedient.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
You don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want some tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're also getting checks.
Vesnikov's costing one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
The Macedonian has four verb ways: pronounced, conditional, command-and-recommendation.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her lines as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you for a second, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be the Japanese economy next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
What do you mean you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a kid's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom drove me to hell.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd love to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a scandal out of a good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trolley.
Who do you have on the list?
He has a very strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom regrets is food.
Be careful not to get in the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
You want some tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day they try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still yes.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a rusty room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
She smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I gave him a slap.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly sick and tired of giving speeches because of the difficult speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
It's licking.
When do you learn?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right to it.
Didn't you hear me yell?
Take a walk.
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back.
Take out the clamp.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Didn't you want the prize?
Look at the diamond.
I'm glad you're glad.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is stupid.
We went bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a dive height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The electric heater warms the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the treetops.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll recap the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
His sleeve's stuck.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone but him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked right next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom told everyone by mistake I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came down to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
It's a shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where am I supposed to park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom had a bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's stockings are torn apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I've got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling too good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multiphase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the sink.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
This mustard is really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She'll have to leave soon.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
He's been blocked.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him that he would remove the stains from his nicotine if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
The powdered carito is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving around town with his brake up and he didn't notice.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you like bowling?
Excuse me, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make a fuss.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What difference does it make?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such a pain in the ass.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
Your bucket's powering up!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom's skillfully writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They must be dropping the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes flashed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can accomplish anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
I'm the one you wanted to meet, Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom's richer than we thought.
I never intended to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard-cores, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom pulled his knee off.
Where do the pinolas come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom came along, and the crowd was clapping.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking a turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not leaving, so make sure it's okay.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking throats.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling much better already.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm being threatened.
Tom's arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always picking on his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Your prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems happy.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was sick and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do as I know and I can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix everything.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't beat yourself up.
I'm not safe here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a dirty dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honey to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom had his eyes lit when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Can you help us at all?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl hailed me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that riddle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue. This is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they're eaten by humans.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends money, but he's not water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's end this.
I've told you a million times already that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book weighs.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's always lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very badly muffled by sounds.
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you teasing me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels protect us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't do any good.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
That's what I'm talking about.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's a real hero.
Where'd you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary everything about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood in front of her.
There's more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six lazy headscarfs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's getting dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love walking down the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the essays.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we'll be eating cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I was gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need some sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Tonight's good for me.
They were heading east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The pyramids that fell off the roof are torn apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have kicked us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
Just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's an emergency.
You'd better go.
Tom's got the exit.
I've got two machines.
What'd you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drunk.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on a bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amoebes are life-long.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't necessarily mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French people write their word for "bubamara."
The crane can lift 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good at?
We're pretty good.
The pork was cut into dice and fried.
Ask a professional person.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of kind.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
Gangsters extorted a large sum of money from a rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
Your conscience bites, doesn't it?
I'm a bloodlust.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first about you.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a tissue, your nose's running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeats the question.
They were originally farmers.
All you have to do is trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything to regret it.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely gets out.
We've set up a tent.
I thought it wasn't gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Let alone stay.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing pajamas and a bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence isn't right grammar.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are more reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree hindered the road.
Don't interrupt, Tom.
No more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
He's doing his maths best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can get it from her.
Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
At each wedding, he wants the groom and each funeral to be the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a nice evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not relevant to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please give it your best shot.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out his pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long does this medicine take?
I don't need a bed.
Get us a face on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not record their happiness.
I still don't know what we're supposed to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
Usually, what is the cause of the pain?
We're addicted to work.
The box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's mean.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
It was pouring sperm; it had a lot of sperm.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I vaccinated against the flu.
Just try.
I want to dance, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one-legged.
Is Tom interested?
It's right here.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how best it is.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's valuables.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm covering for Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
Why is she not more dim?
It's not just a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not wiser.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you come out like that, you'll catch cold.
Is it still hurting?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got shot.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've been making white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We're doing all the drama we need.
We believe in God.
We need to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go alone.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom's a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow, I still can't believe it.
What's a shortcut for?
Thanks again for coming.
They're baiting us.
The wounded soldier barely walked.
The sun just came up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's to prevent Tom from doing it again?
Tom often takes down movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light bounces away from the water.
Tom stabbed the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
Are you all right?
Sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
They couldn't have been avoided.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was watering his garden with this hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gifts.
Tom was a working man.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the sink.
Do you want me to make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the more important capitals.
What's under the covers?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's all drinking tickets.
You ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom approached them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her lily.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they used to talk about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
Who should we start worrying about?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship went down without a doubt.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
My job hurts.
The question is who's going to do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Everybody happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me what it was.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He's on foot going to school.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very cocky.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He ended up in fourth place of 56 runners.
Don't make a fuss.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds pretty good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Knitted wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are at risk.
Tom made a proposal.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to watch her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We heard it very carefully so we wouldn't miss a word.
I already have plans this weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make up for it.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he's had a few beers.
You have loving eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna get better... when the willow comes out.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when does he have fireworks?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't betray anything.
Just yesterday I was thinking about you.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling.
The big question for which no one has found an answer, including me, despite a 30-year study of the female soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The villagers reap harvest.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we split, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is your head all over me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand how valuable that painting is.
Everyone's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Good luck to me!
The concert is over with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Hold on one second.
I've got things to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's quite enough air here.
She's married to nothing from a man.
The wind's steady.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything like this.
The old man took it before he died.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I blinked him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got the measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you call Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm talking about.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
The one who can hear butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They pulled a draw to see who goes first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job to do.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like goods!
But if I was in Brazil, I'd be more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my work hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I've got the flu, and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled down, warm it in the microwave.
The stream is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw him.
Tom's knocking a little bit.
Tom's very immature.
What are they up to?
How's the cylinder volume?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's had a drink.
I liked your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the counter.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom's got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales are a species of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Is he brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, how about you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
She's about to roll.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
You took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm good for that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get cold.
What are you drinking?
How it came -- so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the hall.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Does Tom bother you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been feeling well for two days.
It's too thin.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The coming out of this rain does not come in consideration.
I'll have them go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an asal.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
Long time no see, boys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing a fucking egg at Mary.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
And what are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
And who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that cord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already do.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy was impossible to swim across the river.
Tom had arrived early from Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old housewife has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely saved ourselves.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see Mary sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little dazzled.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people feel that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Dude, you can't just walk up to a woman and grab her -- that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's going on here.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into several waterproof parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'll wash the dishes.
Let's leave this topic alone.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose your temper.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not as shy as he used to be.
You know what I mean?
Don't make a scene now.
What was said to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were guys in groups everywhere, some playing jamleys, some tile, some with a ball, others riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain of love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I was just having breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy's coming from inside.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He hit his head.
We're out of here.
Get the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's getting mad.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's hard to make new friends.
It's funny how people in tropical zones eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell who loves the baby because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.

You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false clue.
Tom was fighting.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a spike on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail eventually.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.

Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?

Why do you object?
I'm sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first person to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Count how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does she cost there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was having pneumonia, I was just checking into my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.

I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
I don't think so.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what tom needs to do.
My mom buys me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you've told them right away.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the solution?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it'd be best if you called them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
Then we were eighteen years old.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate cauliflowers.
I'm in a bad mood to see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Go on with it.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They've been drinking you.
Tom started complaining.
I think you should choose her.
Behave yourself.
You're magnificent.

Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I swam in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
I've been a lot worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
Nobody writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has his rights.
I'm only calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you have to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's cursing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not very tough.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom was looking around. He wasn't expecting anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.

I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get scared.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.

I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be okay.

What's your favorite French guilt?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom was apparently used to this kind of problem.
You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's dead.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.

I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.

I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.

He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?

Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You're dirty.
Everybody kept quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You've given up on the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
It might seem strange.
No one can save themselves from death.
That's not gonna help.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble a lot of times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?

When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom's become famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.

I promise.
This is really annoying.
We need more American slang on Tataba, under emergency!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this seat available?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
In any case, I wouldn't want to get loaded.
Does no one want to sit with you?
It would be really nice if you didn't say anything.

Where's your weapon?

Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.

I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.

What kind of situations would you take advantage of?
Can't we start over?

I'll give Tom whatever he needs.

Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?

It's my job to get early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom could hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom's very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, clear the room.

How much of our bodies are water?

Don't take longer than five minutes.

I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?

I'll turn around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one else did anything.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped out the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
I carried him.
That gave me an idea.
The fed in the watch broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, after me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Kids need love.
That's his job.
Let alone if I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to save the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom shut the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's get a sledgehammer.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they pay pretty good.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There could be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear is green.
Tom regretted what he said to Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom's getting all glum.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just got off the phone with them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom, you've combed your hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're trying to get started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a letter of thanks.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned over the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone acquires their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when washed.
Truth is purpose, not destination.
I'm hiding him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I ran away from class.
Tom's still tied up.
You ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard for me to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll have him go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.

Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him out a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is such a good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted the situation cleared up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
There's no way this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's gone.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's licking up.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say that Mary Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Is that possible, Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the crime scene.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saves the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's going to tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's all yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a gardener.
I'm gonna have to try to handle this on my own.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom texted me over 30 yesterday.
Are you sure you know this isn't making diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
You dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unsustainable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich apart.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom's got two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left uneaten food on the plate.
Tom changed course.
There's no living man in the classroom.
Missile's flying.
We laughed.
Tom was a little smitten.
Tom's just visiting.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was thoughtful.
Tom tried to look busy so that Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I've got his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers flow quickly after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
In addition, I can fly.
We're out of money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I don't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never been too strong to be anything but who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't make me hot.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Sometimes children fear darkness.
Stay back.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's sad.
Kube's hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's what I liked about him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them crying.
It's too bad I didn't ride a bike in here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What'd you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to overshadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
You didn't give them a chance.
He showed up all of a sudden.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He trades in semi-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what needs to be done.
Tom's not gonna catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I didn't know whether to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We waited.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come visit us next month?
Marionettes run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were teasing her because of her clothes.
You'll be confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he had to do.
I'll give them one more chance.
He just called me.
Failure suppressed him.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Even she doesn't understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm bees of health.
You can leave now.
They're stalling.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
The tourists weren't happy.
Tom's room socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like spiders hunting flies, but they let wasps and hornets break through.
You're even prouder than a pawn.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left the key to his desk, just like he used to.
He took off his fur jacket downstairs, went upstairs, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing about this, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was wrong with Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're City.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Is there a long time left, Tom?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that?
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This handle doesn't spin.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my own legacy.
"Why did you break my vase?" "It's nice to meet you."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
There's a big day waiting for us tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me breathe.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
He's watching TV now.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can chain me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat stuck his claws in my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What did you do till so late?" "I spoke to your ex on the phone."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little burdened with something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're bothering me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I hit him in the jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going to take a break for lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
They all turned Tom down.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's a lot to tell.
I heard what you're saying.
We have to face facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten up.
We're really good.
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?

How do you form a set of nouns?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got a nasty cold from him.
It's getting better.

You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get mad.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're really good.
That was a sneaky trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not done.
Tom was put in jail for spying.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom aren't too disappointed.
These little letters are only read with a bat.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a chopper.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I won't hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sorrow in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do what you say.
He'd do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't mean.
I decorated my room.
This is madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Leave Tom to make his boss.
Our Chun was approaching the small island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute, I'm done with my laundry. I'm gonna go get it.

When was the last time you fed the baby?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.

I'm humping.
They're gonna fire me because I'm so late for work.
I thought it might be nice to buy you some earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a trick.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
No smokers here.
Are you still working on the freezer?
The city restored that old historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's really ugly.

That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's in the pool with his friends.

Everything went well.
Where are my bags?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our best.
I'll pay.

Did anyone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They talked quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going to the point.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were being chased.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig wells for you.
I've got a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're a good cook.
There's no shorter path to the top, only to the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
It's obvious you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automatic cars are now spread out.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He's gone to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The organist was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a eggs.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipe?
They picked her well.
What does it all mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, witty, and pretty girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a bum.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
He's getting dressed up to take a bath.
The river of sweat started pouring on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you hang out?
The movies are great entertainment.
I wasn't looking at anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me like jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all smiled.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight due to unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they're coming back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board's against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was making a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The cork doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to have hot coffee and Tom wants to have coffee.
I gave her a fake address.
I'm in my room.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's on a roll.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take off your clothes.
I'm having a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether or not she can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost got into a fight with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
There was a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm asleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
The Germans have a loose attitude toward nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
You forget your wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They're both screaming.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was treated with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I pissed Tom off a lot.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island’s inhabitants are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent poets.
Can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom's never coming back here again.
Nobody likes crying.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a mountain far away.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's really hammered.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We're here first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We had a very nice meal.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
They beat me up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought a smelly garbage bag.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely gets out.
Tom caught malaria on his way to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom's diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How come you made such a mistake?
You're good at remembering.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to know the answer already.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We're screwed.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boney brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't let me look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls aren't playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele consists mostly of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the difference.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname is perfect for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You took your sword out.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked a mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss the subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a dick!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom wouldn't give up.
Tom was suspended.
They're hooking up.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom.
I'd like a marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrified.
Tom seems to be a mess.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
We may find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're not.
He's been working at the embassy since three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
We might get a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom got mad.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Commendation moves the students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measured on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only as nobles.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can he choose one man?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger stuck deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I get paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't have been safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your children's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear those thunderbolts?
Don't mix business with pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unbuttoned.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss him off, Tom.
I turned the fan on and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not quite true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he hits him, his heart stops.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank loaned a million dollars to the company.
I've got a lot more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
I guess I had too much to drink yesterday.
Tom had a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom shut the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get inside.
He forged the sword from the steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls the husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did he want to see, Tom?
I'm so scared.
Dan's pissed off.
I don't even know which one.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their goal?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool that Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where you visited Mary yesterday.
You've gone too far!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I got a feeling the show's gonna quit; they haven't sold much cards.
Tom's going.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does he swim often, Tom?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
It's my job to read books.
He's been executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting silly.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own faults.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning on cooking Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I get the impression it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Even though Jane had one case smaller than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live in some part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he's gonna pour the torch.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what he was wearing when I met you?
The lightning is usually accompanied by thunder.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom's cornered him on the ground.
This lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to hang out with him.
Excuse us a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you're not sleeping yet?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were making love.
I set fire to the junkyard.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this a little too good for you?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back about my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar sounds good.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and how it holds its head reminds me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would fight back.
She always works hard.
What country are you a citizen to?
Elephant trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I prefer cats.
There's still little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
You can't keep this heat up.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you right away.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you can say.
I can't handle this job.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree sails.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchens.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'm gonna get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin condition.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom can't feel for himself.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise was making me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom's turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I have a sinus problem.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you so.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's skillfully handling a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any Internet sites.
They're dropping the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a spinpop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was crushed with semen.
Tom's fair.
This is what you should do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand what happened to you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
Expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaka's got a flat tire.
We made wood.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her cut your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I was just trying to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a mess.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know what it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We were eating lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've been through the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You only think she's weird because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's not good yet.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, give me a call.
Was he honest?
The filter was empty.
Don't say it.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I did my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still after pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is clouded.
Tom took pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, what about you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I can go.
I contribute.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've come up with everything.
I'd like to know why they erased my name from the list.
Tom put all this together.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's quiet.
Before that, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's very far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
That's not what I was taught.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was letting go of the gnaw.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers at the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
These two seem to be dating again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
It is a moral choice for the translator whether to translate something or not. Some things are better left in the language he produced.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom seems worried.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun constantly varies.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked deep into Mary's eyes and smiled.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
Yeah, you found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on a bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to leave, Tom?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powdered drug.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom measured you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her great-granddaughter.
It's our best chance.
Smells like flowers.
Tom's got a crush.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night they killed Tom.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
He's had a lot of trouble with it.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think he's getting a shot of it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's dead.
My grandmother used to live with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
So our conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were wrong.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen is blowing green light.
English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is rotting now.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom's a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been asleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel just burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you could get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You wonder what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married 26 years old.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening.
Tom's always trying to do what he thinks is right.
He doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the magnificent chandeliers she has in her house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have on your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying the piano.
They need the money.
He's a good swimmer.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as it took to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's got a deal with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
Guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's dawn.
Mr. Gorbachev, take down this wall!
Tom seems startled.
Tom's in the middle of nowhere.
It's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be tough.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you laughing at?
I'll call him right back.
It's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt this loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not really Tom's favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school in a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing your sayings?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was at home Friday night was when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think's gonna change.
That's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just that it's making me sick.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's totally mad.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satisfy my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a four-listed kid.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom seems really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say goodbye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
That sounds perfectly valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's safe.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very much alike with Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept his mouth shut all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming about you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get our souls together.
I'm sure he'll pass the test that's coming up.
We're on our way to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom got pissed off.
This is from us.
On an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary's got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started moaning.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We've got everything.
I made him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's unstoppable.
His girlfriend lost weight.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming, he woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has weak eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants a lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your apron on.
You might be wrong.
I baked cake too.
Tom's got a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
I've already written everything I had to write.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston's worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom right now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen how it goes.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like that before.
You're so cheeky.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tataba really very slow today, or is it me?
Did you call me at Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back with him.
That's the way you need it.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back till dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I had too much to eat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one in that place.
Stop!
Would you like some cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not clear in any way.
That was very negligent of Tom.
It's a double.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them cut your hair.
Distraction is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay good money.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom peeked inside.
At the same time, you are heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live without you.
Let's just say for now you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's what disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom's spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm in charge.
Tom hit Mary over the head with this one.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusherly written.
You should help them.
Tom wasn't even crying.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more regrettable than stupidity and indifference.
They all cry.
Tom was protesting us.
What are the websites from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been snowing all day.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm getting some sleep.
It's not scientifically proven that there's a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking all over for them.
I like your website very much.
I'll get you.
Press this button.
Tom can really fight.
What's bothering her, anyway?
Do you have the keys?
Tom's got his car torn apart.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's being cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is roasted in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is so much like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are plenty of rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees collapsed.
Lions don't distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's a mess.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet wasn't there.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
We're flowing from the right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Uploading calendar to wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They've given us a curse.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The turtles live long.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very tightly.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're amongst friends.
You're getting weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a hot night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from a sub-deck.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for lunatics.
Why would you help him?
Tom lit his shoes.
We lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom loaned me some money.
Do I bother you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's licking his boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom rubs his face.
What good do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
She turns me on when she's wearing those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live upstairs under this one.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's making fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his kid.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third time's the charm.
We need to get away.

You're clear.
I'm against this project.
Weren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's written reports.
It hurts here.
You're worrying Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inappropriate time.
This dog is staring at me like he wants to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they were not real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really nice.

Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it!
Is this correct in English?

She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't exactly know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood.
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom retired.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherry's red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look so good.
You made Tom unhappy.
Keep it warm.
Tom looked like he was being resentful.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become both physically and mentally stronger.
She's a lifesaving girl.
If I could've stayed, I would've stayed.
Please stop.

What would you say?
Make two lines.
Titles should draw the attention of readers.
He was sitting right in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.

What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.

Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
I'm in a terrible pain here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.

I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
A long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it's done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold out there?
You should go to bed early.
Tom felt the danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom's the top guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Did you write in your diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can he do it alone?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
Up and down, we're ready.
Tom's got a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the cork off.
I helped him clear the table.
I was eating a potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to walk down the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I ever said anything to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could have found someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom's been drinking.
I slept in the cone.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what's gonna work.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
There's an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Assal Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
You saved us the bell.
He's got me all over my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems to have stopped.
Your fun continues your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can make it here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The flesh smells bad.
Am I supposed to know you?
Tom's skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing nothing.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just screamed Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm gonna go help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son likes rockets very much.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
You got here before them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent her to the table the new fly he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's a mess.
The landscape is excelling.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating his victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'll try to hold it together.
It's autumn.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so magnificent.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderbolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything on his own.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Soup's too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom peeked into the tunnel.
How could you want to be my friend?
Seems familiar to me.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basil, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a discerning man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered, even.
I'm working out.
She may have lied to you, but she won't lie to me!
Let's just get the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled some coins.
The room was a cranberry.
It's just to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that got stuck in his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how it hurts to get stabbed by catfish.
We're importing wheat from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a thick vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but there he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look into darkness.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it's not like we're asking Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are you calorie potatoes?
They'll get it soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I worry about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make faces for him.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I get your name and phone number?
Tom used to throw rocks at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry about Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a couple of days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
I was hired to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They've all got doubts.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
That's not what I'm good at.
Tom's got a grandma's collection.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are plague transporters.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's out of his mind.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The King did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom says hello to Mary with a wave.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French quite well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would I do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me out a little bit.
Am I here too soon?
It sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his cords.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
The dog gave it to him?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom's gone off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an unspeakable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little frowny.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave himself up to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medellín.
Did you stop beating up your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'll get it.
Survive the species of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom took the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom's moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
The book will help you write skillfully.
This area is in the valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please evacuate the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm making my honey toast in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I've got plenty of land.
The area is very isolated.
I assume the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the count.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick talk.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom's got a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good for sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom felt he needed to be redeemed.
This one's for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He hit the dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
I wrote this book myself!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must isolate it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Take my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who knew that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic about his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs am I supposed to do a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's turning into a pie maker.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
Isn't that understood?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's smoke and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more reliable.
Would you like to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
He's developing addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check on those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Mass is over.
Tom wiped the blade off the jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Do your palate bleed?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer pint on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
We're giving a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father's very strict.
Maybe I'd better come by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you get off?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked sharp through my glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not get in the way of Tom.
This rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did you hurt yourself, Tom?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It's over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression for many periods of his life.
You want me to grab your bags?
I'd trust that with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is going wild.
There were penguin rates on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a tow truck.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I don't talk fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope your new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was gnawing something.
She's studying anal.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on the chewing gum.
Let's do this my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to acquire bad habits!
She's got started acting weird.
They probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda about her interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're also strong with you.
The president looked strong.
Buy what?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a narrow town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's Tom ringing?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer's careful.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now it's time to make up for it.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll manage.
Does she have a dog?
We're resting.
Mary wore fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French more defiantly than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That drug calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be the last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx started to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom fuchersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
He's doing good.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut down the tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini, finish up.
Single couples shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a manual matter.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister rip the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
No sign of Tom yet.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
The sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary did.
That was very helpful.
He hung me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
Bringing in after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
There's a red light on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow came today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How many bets?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circulates through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right toe hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's cooking for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Watch the drawing.
Their houses were built from stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean things like that.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
At what age did you begin to menstruate?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very eloquent.
You were right, guys.
It happens.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
You gonna eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't piss him off, Tom.
It's a difficult task.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
Let alone he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, dear.
They have increased the realm's territory.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about it by now.
My sister and my mother are aunts.
I've been looking everywhere.
Tom's incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
He's gone red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hooked up with a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these counsel in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Take your things away.
Where'd you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What's in it for me?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be around for this.
Any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
I've had a headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars, and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't feel bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I got off the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom needs to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom unwrapped the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood among the ruins.
Tom's a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Hand me the pliers.
The Hague love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the bull.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom had a good time today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we've got.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you up to?
Now this is your house.
How about some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life by doing just what I want.
It's not my call.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
The desire is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary getting ready to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, and brought it up; and they reaped it; and the river that was overthrew was a well.
He feels hate for his dad.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom drove Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a printed mistake.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I was barely saved from getting caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom came back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by winners.
Tom was the only one on board when it exploded.
Who's going to make up for the zen?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You cheated on me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one actually knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
You were looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're embarrassing.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We've got fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost here.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red at dusk.
I came to wish you luck.
It would be a pleasure for you to come.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I don't speak English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan got this right.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's warm here in hell.
I've overlooked that.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
It's cold in here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Children, if you'd stayed here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
Beautiful!
The palace has a tall tower.
Kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's moving away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.

I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
Let alone if I didn't do it.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why won't anyone help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying that?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll kick you out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for your meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's been raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's been blind since birth.

Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?

His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.

Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.

Tom seems delighted.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's her.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're disorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Are you a sport?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.
Tom lied to us the whole time.
Tom's never said he'd help us.

The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.

I only practice to look good when I'm naked.
Thousands of years make up a millennium.
I'll put it on your tab.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's an honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you present it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
- I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I like cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm gonna go hide.

I'm waiting for the green light.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I've been waving my head off.
Tom told me he's planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to the end.
I'm gonna go change.
You hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.

We can get started.
Come alone.
Run a pencil out of your pocket.

Write to Tom.

Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom's waiting for us.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was raining two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The hoove cannon calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.

Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He called his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom's permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate it.
How many cups of coffee a day are too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I was clapping my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I raise a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much as I do.
I've washed one.
Write down your date of birth.

I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is there a difference?
Come visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your bag?
Most will help her sleep.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll get the dishes.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
He's been doing a lot of intense work lately, but he doesn't see the slightest result of it.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not convinced.
That's not necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming by.
I'm just as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
She spent the day last night drinking in a local pub.
I'm in.
Do you need a rend?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
You wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen rainbows.
I don't think they were following us.
I feel free.
Just keep smiling.
You haven't noticed the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have any tea.
I'm tired.
But that's no argument!
Tom's got a pie.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave Tom alone.
I've been through the shock.
That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
Then we were just a few people in the middle of a group of gorillas.
She started sticking her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
Should I not invite Tom to my party?

You travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the back pain you had?
That's what everybody does.
Tom's often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
A is a set consisting of Articles B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three went back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom exercises violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
Let alone Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.
Tom's had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
Your car's on fire.
She was able to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the strength of will when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is rustic.
At your service.
I like watching football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this much food?
This is one of Boston's most popular restaurants.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I'm gonna have to clean up.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Was it hard for you?
Tom could barely hear his voice.
Don't say a word.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to cancel.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
She's pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep it off.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I'm starving for you to lean.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to take our minds off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Vardi the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom could never have done it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new wristwatch.
Doesn't look very different.
Study yourself.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
We're embarrassing him.
That's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did you get it?
Tom wrote me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse is right up and down.
I don't know anybody like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the jewels last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetal movement?
I can't do it alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All the comments are too much.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them help?
Tom flushed his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not mistaken.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
No gold virtue is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I've been napping there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
They're such a couple!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's loud in here.
What can be done?
I assume you found him.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going to the point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
The snow is one foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's biting the rattle.
Now I'm gonna go look for Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom, listen to me right now.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without trouble.
You got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.

What can we do for her?
I really like this wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not quite happy with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He ran off so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It's got sentimental value.
I asked her to dance with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me long.
Tom's in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.

He was in the mud to his knees.
You told Tom about that, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's resourceful.
He's an honest man.
Your pajamas are too big.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
It's still good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom's here to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of the interpunctional signs is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.

That's really great.

Do you want us to take you home?
That house was built out of bricks.
We've made no conclusion.
Tom came by around 2:30.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat's incursion.
The crowd was clapping.
I'll let the detlins grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what are you looking at?
We're in the middle of something.
I was too tired to go on.
It's got its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson yesterday night.
Can this page be used similar to Twitter?

My dad bought me a digital wristwatch for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's human.
Don't you feel lonely?
Did you cook coffee?
Don't like it so much.
Stop when you talk to me.
He's always happy.
The forest was very peaceful.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intrusive.
Most of the clothing worn by Europeans is produced outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search the Internet.
When I was younger, I always traveled by hitchhiking.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
You're so negative.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here?
When I pee, something like a gnaw comes out.
You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I play volleyball a lot.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That's what he's gonna teach them.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
Let alone if I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom's in a hurry.
We're ready to fight.
I suggest you listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.

This time has passed especially quickly.
There's no way out.
The stormy rain of the night made it harder to save survivors of the downed ferry.
My wife's hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom got mad.
Look at the count.
There must be a key.
You cut the apple.
All the balls are yellow.
I got a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they hit anyone?
The factory produces toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like cattle.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of humanity.
It's still for sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
From time to time, I'd have been passed by a carriage.
Tom, put the gun down.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do my job in one day.
You almost rocked yourself out of terror.
Suddenly I felt old.
They piss me off.
You were getting some sleep.
I'm ready.
He killed him to avenge his late father.
Tom took a cookie.
I've been learning French since I was 13.
Men aren't really that different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite oils to cleanse the face and nourish the skin.
I'm so sick of French.
I don't care if there's 20 girls.
The bull is sickening.
Tom's walking.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't get it.
Born in 1960.
How about one?
Baburas are usually mild in taste.
I'm shaken.
It could rain today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Don't you think you'd start picking hairs out of that?
How are you gonna get away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you going to do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing to do.
He's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom, listen.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The noise will wake the baby.
I'm late for a spinach.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the two-seater with Mary watching TV.
We don't mind.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm not usually at work on Monday.
I'm a fool to trust them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
I'd be broken.
There's a lot of traffic in the bar.
He's throwing the idea away.
Tom was more and more surprised.
Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dishwasher work?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, this soup is too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do whatever you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You'll have to learn more next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody wants Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom's got two seats.
I'll send you the recipe.
It'd look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like best.
Your transgressions defiled the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I have terrible news.
If possible, I would like to experience once again such bitter love as the basic one.
I saw Tom around.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom broke the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom suggest this?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to watch the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We broke up our conversation.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't focus on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became addicted.
I just want the money.
I don't say bad things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How bad was Tom hurt?
Was he compassionate?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that possibly mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't pick.
Is there any sugar?
Dan and Linda finally moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
He looked funny.
Tom plays in the band.
We live together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry, isn't it a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
Aprili-li-li!
Tom used to say that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I've decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have to work your ass off.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I take a picture with or without flashes?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was playing.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They're too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's a full-age man now.
We don't sell alcoholic drinks and cigarettes to minors.
I came back on a bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The struggle seems to be about to end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's a dick.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and get it over with.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
Think what you want.
Where I can find a hospital.
Don't ruin the party.
I can make that happen.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a few months.

The cure worked.
Tom can play guitar.
Who broke it?
Liner's short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you someplace where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, lazy boy!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one likes us very much.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom's got the candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything's ready.
She's in a bad mood.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Get rid of it.
Have you decided yet?
Tom's listening.
Can anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I'm in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It's been hard for us.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on the chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was from them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital, recovering from what he's overdosed on.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were getting ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's the man.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this isn't the right time or the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom's untrustworthy.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet cap up.
That's good training.
This chair is self-evident.
I should have said no.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactics.
I've lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my libe.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should be sorry for them.
I don't bargain.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guest.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
It's quite a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Keep Tom busy.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom swears too much.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through deeds.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
Such behavior was childish of him.
I'm walking with her.
That'd be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little embarrassed about Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the carriages.
I've been kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is delicious.
We're on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom's very strict with himself.
She's a nerd.
Lemonade's cold.
The lamp was swinging back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom's a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom doesn't have manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell out of the tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the mild things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will go astray.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
You stabbed me with something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Take care of Tom.
They look familiar.
We've got work to do for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Contact her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you with me.
I like to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see him.
Did he sleep at least a little bit?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snow Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new to this town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
It was a great concert for him.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're busy enough with worry.
I don't think Tom's gonna be much help.
Tom seems worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there's anything he can do to help.
We could've gotten by.
This isn't anybody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend girl was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, a football field and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should have given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom, let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds perfectly acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trusted and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give up.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't shut up.
She shut down the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two breeds in the Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's hands are tied.
Tom's been set up.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them.
The noise has disrupted all the city.
A person who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
Tom was a pain in the ass.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears attacked clothes.
Tom was barefoot.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
The girls don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined it.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I grow cattle.
She borrowed the ruler.
I'll see you around.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom do the same?
The thief turned himself into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsed.
I wish I could've helped you more.
You can't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I passed her by car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Ask him to join us.
It will not be easy to do so without great help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They've given her a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You're gonna have a wrinkle.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser throws out hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here by my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone helping me.
They don't want that.
Tom takes over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
Valuable stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You've got to ask your mother's permission before.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're a lot of chicken.
It's been a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
Quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things nobody else remembered.
You can easily tell them apart.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote his homework.
I counted to 200.
Check this out.
Shall I go?
A boy looks like a monkey.
Butterflys are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you take money on a loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project isn't going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
I want you to express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I've got homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily ashamed.
Is everything getting there in a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom's always been poor.
That's a beautiful ring.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a large amount of money from her.
Can you help me figure that out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was to return to her home to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make webs.
You really talk a lot.
It's possible it's too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what another says.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter isn't married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom's innocent.
Tom, it's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're out of your mind!
It seems to me to be the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm going to do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound died.
Who cut your hair?
I don't really understand it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't take it.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It's been a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom's not talking to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'm gonna scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
You want me to watch him?
You're such a hater.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you think of contacting them?
There's nothing you can do.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
You should be okay.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's soulless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was enjoying listening to music.
Try your shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did you say Tom was gonna start his party?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a very good job.
My legs are still in pain.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to appreciate his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to watch over you.
Stop where they are.
Are you her pimp?
"She loves music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut his hair.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The nurse gave her an injection against the flu.
Did you try talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a cliff while he was cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help it.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the compositions were good except for yours.
I don't think Tom's going to be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday's gonna fall on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I was.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one's here.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it unless you show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing looks like a drunk lunatic anymore.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking his clothes off.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This is almost working.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The bandits tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their arrogance.
Dan missed no episodes of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
We'll be right here.
Why do they do that?
I studied college for four years and got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, all that's left is ash.
Tom wants every vegetable except a cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll drive Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to shut him out of their company.
Those who mix verbic endings of "tea" and "tya" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened next?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
That's not what I was counting on.
I was careless.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom caught her cleaning up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom saw two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences this month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really bad.
Would you like some cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I feel a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all-wise and all-godly.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's got his car well.
You're interesting.
I can win this time.
All the people on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to get him a present.
I asked her to describe him.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks the Caucasus language, does not have common phonems or common letters with English, can completely overcome English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom was laughing.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has his own closet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Take care of this mess.
Blood flows through blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
Why didn't you help us?
I'd like to learn French a lot.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned a lesson the hard way.
You showed my friends the forgeries.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
Excuse me.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm fed up.
He was eating a kale salad.
I'm gonna run.
Tom's chewing something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom never visited Boston.
I'm glad to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get the ice.
Come and have a look.
Do you think you like it?
Innocentness is often a blessing, not virtue.
Tom's heart rate's up.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She insisted on how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, courageous, and yet I don’t know what.
Have you lied to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You're busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I was embarrassed by heteronormal propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't take much longer.
The virtues are their own reward.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were doing.
I don't know how to act here.
We should advertise on TV.
Tom nodded.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right for me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
I've got all this stuff waiting for me.
Is this diamond real?
You know I don't eat meat.
He seems very sleepy.
Yesterday I prepared a mushroom roast.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!
Although the rainworm owns both a male and a female reproductive system, it needs another individual to fertilize.
The failure shamed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom passed out.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm going that way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The temperature on the surface of the sun is supposed to be about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd's gone crazy.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to examine him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
It's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did you want Tom to eat?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
You ever write Tom a letter?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're just in time.
I was kind of sorry for you.
Cigarettes suck for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavalier would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't play Tosha.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would have said no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant at the time.
Tom never lost hope.
I have to spend more time at work.
What kind of situations would you do that in?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Luckily, this shed is stable, or last night the storm would've knocked her out.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got everything written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll give up.
Mary’s eyes lighted with pleasure.
It's evil to swear.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm sick of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's acting secretive.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller cheated on him.
Everything's in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the fine.
I want to know who that phone call came from.
Were you home at 10:00?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'm gonna make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple matter.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to talk to her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Tataba's new version.
It looks aimless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Is that really what Tom did?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not into sports.
I'm amazed, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Let your horses know.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt so alone.
I'd love to try new things out.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He did wonders.
The glands secrete chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best you don't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I was giving her help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
Good to see you, Tom.
I was kind of sorry about her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could've said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It'll happen soon enough.
Hey, it's suffocating in here.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom was gonna say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom behaved decently.
I guess I'll just have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay whatever you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak louder?
Where's the meeting going to be?
Let's play Truth or Challenge.
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started going through the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers very much.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife is sick of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebites are one-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's so stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but it's more durable today.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
They could have been followed.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a bank.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to talk to him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He's gone soon.
The children were so excited after the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You defeated me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her foster mother.
An international language would be very useful to mankind.
I was giving them help.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom's got mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Nice weekend.
Do you like soda water?
Tom winked at the girls.
We've had a terrible exorcism.
Tom seems different today.
Throw them off deck.
Japan as a country has many different features.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
Don't be so perverse!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your pay.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom launders money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Well, didn't you say you can swim?
Don't put pressure on Tom.
They betrayed me.
And the paper's gone.
Tom can't express himself.
Attendance at the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating lamb creams, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We waited for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is heavy.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor's looking at the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke is rising in the air.
The printer doesn't work.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's feeling much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the game.
Tom doesn't want a party.
Looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm an only child.
We don't want any new accidents.
There's no way it could have been Tom.
I'm gonna kill you.
Most people have a strong resistance to getting up early, even when it has to.
Give me the gloves.
I was watching Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be familiar with the oils and submersibles for motors.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't fire them like that.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You get sick, right?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary was gonna enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running to me.
Tom seems very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituents of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I have to go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much of an appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom was soon lost in the crowd.
For the record, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a beaver.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you keep your eyes shut when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her entirely.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agree.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's roaring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't offer us a cup of coffee to Mary.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the Semire.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the frame of the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm happy for that.
It's like I screwed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I are flying the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour until the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird raised the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom isn't the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to take the time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do to them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got the wooly hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's really strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was hurt.
I have a guilty conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're making a lot of noise.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with your parents?
Tom's got something to do with it.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I pay my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his hearts together.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to take a bath.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just be in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little dumb, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's you that matters.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them at their choice.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt from the other side.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm in the middle of something.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom's been gnawing loudly.
It was Peter.
Tom started snorkeling.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaking out.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to listen to Tom for the first time?
Tom, relax your hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the alco flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Though I am a man of honor, I am a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there any problem I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
She deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to investigate something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary kept him quiet.
We met in a monk.
How was Tom acting?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is space black?
I'm sorry.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't growl.
Tom's conscious.
Tom pissed off Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be coming today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the power of will.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I came by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do this one time.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they still have a cure for that.
Every member must attend.
She didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You must let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go see Tom.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You cut your clavicle while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was a pain in the ass.
This isn't an easy decision.
His prophecy came true.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was up to something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom hilling.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve for that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave him to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy as hell.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost his heart.
You don't need to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't take credit cards.
It was all right here.
- They look a bit apprehensive.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of my house on slippers.
I think Tom's a crevice.
I don't give a shit about a terrible infection and the ovary and it's out.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't work.
It's out of the question.
Tom's heading for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He sometimes behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
It's probably not a good time for this right now.
I'll be back in a moment.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake of caps?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes to talk.
I've got to ask you a few questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even shaken story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is sacred land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he couldn't play tennis.
Where did you find her?
This was on top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we had a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you getting into it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people do you have in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You pulled your ankle off.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little pompous.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy these things.
Not here or there.
Phone books are fascinating.
You don't need to be defensive.
This is the most beautiful pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
