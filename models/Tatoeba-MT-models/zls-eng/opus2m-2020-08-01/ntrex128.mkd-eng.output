Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that they “look like Muppets ”
Some members of the congregation are amazed at the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be a subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party is concerned that "he rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh, the Welsh twp means "stupid/dude", and pwp means "ha".
A Plaid member said the party is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party was "free-minded" about the change of name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" (an. Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any words by which members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave Wells the power to change his name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public consultations on proposals that suggested great support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of members of the assembly, the commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to pass a draft law on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members of the assembly and designing the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a right to her territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for a change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are quiet as the churches in Harlem face problems
" Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialise differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings filled with a type of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and therefore the day these churches close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the Whites' congregations before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists moved away in the '30s.
The congregation of black people practicing their faith nearby takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of sellers on 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson's parishioners had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillone.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillone in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the unprofessional leaders of the church, and part of the Episcopal diocese.
The church board - the church’s governing body, composed of unprofessional leaders - wrote to the eparchy in July with concern that the diocese "will require the transfer of expenses" to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old kid in lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the day of opening the lobster season, authorized organs said.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel stated that he first thought it was a thrill to catch a lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ He bit me!
You bit me!”
The whole keybone was visible to him," Hammel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
"I have called for everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'' Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the children's hospital working in San Diego, being seduced as if in critical condition.
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gills, said at a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark was spotted in the area, but decided that the shark was not dangerous.
Gils added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorised bodies have closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's taking over Boots, Supercoma and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of stock houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom that weighs £2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household sector declines, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 shops everywhere in the country, and will be presented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the space of shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of Boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, the first of which opened in Crayon, southern London last week, and the second one opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and buying smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly look like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos' stores in hundreds of shops, and he also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which according to them increased the sale of groceries and made the purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganise its beauty departments and pharmacies ended successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement on how to split profits from chemical goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "Anger" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound contract
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Dan left "Anger" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of Truly for products and household accessories.
The two's business is linked to the Gop brand of Guinea Paltrow.
This 37-year-old morning programme manager told Instagram she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a TV golden girl confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghemshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean she no longer has time to devote herself to their brand of Truly for products and household allowances.
Business is linked to the Gop brand of Guinea Paltrow and has been said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain at one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long - lasting future that she would send over the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all the affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the opening.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe's headquarters full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s programme guide, one of Britain’s top-paid stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in pillow and candlestick products, clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Kap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity (I am the star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We are not commenting on his business ventures".
Serious talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media about making comments some would consider "non-presidential" and because he is so positive for North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice disguised as a "representer of news".
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the deuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders of the UN's General Assembly that the North sees no "adequate response" from the United States to the early moves of North Korea for disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We are in great agreement with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results -- completed missile samples, helped release hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking to Kim.
"It is easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead of him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no natural disaster was declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children, ” a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that are constantly affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for nature’s anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure, and it spent a lot of money on roads and tracks.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of reelection next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.
Look: Daniel Starge from Liverpool team equals against Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from losing in the prime minister's goal league in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri passed the ball to Starge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before heading it to the far-off rate.
The ball moved high above the 16th as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante coming and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just kicked."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 in half after Belgian star Ed Hazzard scored in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the "blue" put his heel back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before he kicked the ball almost halfway through the court, and then sprinted into half of Liverpool.
They quickly handed in Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, leading Hazzard into the 16th.
Hazzard passed the defense and finished the network of a remote stasis with a left foot impact along Alison Becker's Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples in the team stage of the Champions' League at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, the spokesman for the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho agency said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was hit by a shot-up of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious contact with us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in a facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and as police say, they will inform the victim's close people.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no entry was allowed or exit the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants are now told that it will be hours before they can return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying "it's so horrible".
At 2:00, two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was outside.
Many police officers stood in the cordon watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or contact Anonymous crime fighters at 0800 555 111, quoting entry 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue of parliament became the latest memory strike in the "prescription of history" dispute
Its persecution would be poetic justice for its "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "madness" and "experience to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure would become a goal in front of the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclast of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
The beautiful presentation of Sir William Humo Thorneycroft’s Cromwell is evidence of 19th - century opinion and a piece of the history of a figure many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it's a completely accurate play is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer ripped up and killed a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only after his last name "Juan", was found dead with a severed artery, dressed in blood near the stakes of the market in Liupansui in the province of Gizou, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place vaccines on pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Kinghai, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig carriage.
He declared that there was a great boar in the trunk with blood on its mouth.
The forensic survey confirmed that the 550-pound boar broke up the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said my cousin, named "Wu", according to a quote in Gwayang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Juan entering the market at 440 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
Market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police are gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs who attacked humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig put a Welsh farmer next to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will rain in the southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
The rose brought winds of 85 mph, a hurricane of category 1 of 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning over the Pacific Ocean and is heading east to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to introduce a large tropical moisture north of the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical damp with the near - approaching depression will create abundant rains in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, the flow of ruins and possible landslides in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rains that will be approximately 2 to 3 inches [2 to 3 inches] an hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid floods are possible because of the rapidly exacerbating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
In particular, it is recommended not to go to the desert on foot at the opportunity of tropical rain.
The torrential rain may cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The near - approaching depression will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch in total are possible, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning before the rain spreads more late Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rain will spread to "four corners" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperature are expected throughout the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be found in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the Middle East.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast points to the possibility of super-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony Thursday of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the staunch political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular conversion programmes at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, put together an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's committee that he was 100 percent sure Cavanaugh was getting her piano and he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said it was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, saw it on Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To show it better, it is an audience of a size similar to a playoff contest in football or awards at the film academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led in front of all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After moderately the Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him shouting as protesters Friday morning as he tried to enter the elevator for the hearing of the judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as they reprimanded him, and all this was transmitted live to CNN.
"They stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "you have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was due to vote to advance Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate for voting.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominated next week, which was demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and several senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had great meaning, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over coastal
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Cackers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect mutual costs is "integratedly absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: police arrest suspect Ditéon Simpson for the death of a sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Sims' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Ditéon Simpson has been arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge's police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a CBS partner WAFB said.
After they questioned Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge's pathologist's office announced a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head against the neck.
The department thanks the refugee unit of Louisiana state police, the criminal laboratory of state police, police at South University and citizens of the area for the assistance they have given in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked police for its "activity in search of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot Beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 catch balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, basketball team coach at Louisiana State University Will Wade said the team had been "destroyed" and "in shock" since Sims died.
"This is what you worry about all the time," the coach said.
Vulcan casts ashes on Mexico City
Pocateptel volcano ashs have reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
A national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity in the crater and have been registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was followed by more tumults and earthquakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in the settlements of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increased activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Gojo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence clashed with the police for public order and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used their thumbs to stop the fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted "There is no forgetfulness, there is no forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local press said.
The tensions remain high in a region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low because of the boycott by people who are against secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said she no longer hopes Catalonia has the chance to gain independence.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
While winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence have been struggling to keep the dynamics this year with many of their most famous leaders either in a self-elected persecution or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and a consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, filming a protest to support police, said the conflict was backed by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before a trial last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we saw from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderi: Men arrested after driving a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly crashed a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged and the building itself.
At one point, he may have been shot with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga's win won the 1-0 Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The improved Livingstone has stifled the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernyan in second position.
Gerard's side has lost its victory in the season's championship and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which are eight points behind.
Earlier, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the six-game division, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but he pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after skating the blow with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
Guests gladly let Rangers dance ahead of them, knowing that they could create problems with their actions.
And that's exactly how the crucial goal came to pass.
Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set Menga, who only touched the goal of the 16-year-old.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the hosts, so goalie Liam Kelly mostly didn't play.
That scheme continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos is a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of Rangers' skills, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set of action on Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen were constantly passing it and was constantly defended, while two penalty requests -- after Halket's dispute over Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for hand-to-hand play -- were rejected.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston - Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was remarkable, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still held Connor Goldson and Joe Waral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they were once under Gerard’s guidance, they are now lagging behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once were they able to open the hosts – and that is a small awareness of the Rangers, who were found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed admission in Colonya
There were smiles and blue skies Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They have deteriorated due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed for Kolonia to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds also pleaded, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposed protesters reflect the division of a visitor known as a hero by some German Turks and criticised as an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident on a trip to Deptford: cyclist dies in a car crash
A Velosipedi died after a car crash in London.
The clash took place near the intersection on the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and came to an ambulance, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The clash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist in a car accident on Childers Street, where the driver escaped, about a mile from Saturday's clash.
Metro police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been set up and buses have been rerouted and it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers have been injured in riots in a male prison with a high level of security, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Vorcestshire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Teams from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited in one wing.
Cops are treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison said: "Specially trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, police for public order and peace were called into prison to deal with serious riots in which personnel were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (can be useful for the dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression will hit Arizona, but that is what will likely happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest region, causing a risk of sudden floods.
The state meteorological station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, down to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and State Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move along a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The State Meteorological Station in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricanes Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches on the edge of Arizona's Mongolon.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rockies Mountains and Great Basin, will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to benefit because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Sushi Monitoring Authority, almost 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
First, hurricane rose's path led to ground dives all over the lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles [85 km] per hour, is 385 miles [385 miles] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north by 12 miles [12 km] an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific and decreases.
So rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain,"weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is the many heavy rains in lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States," the US State Hurricanes Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and ruins flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsamer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace on Midsamer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock district, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage of the case to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the Democratic Party's greatest malice and anger".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the most cruel and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump told a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the Democratic Party's greatest malice and anger during its nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blassy Ford that he committed sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
I am not running, but I am really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump said Democrats have a mission to "resist and interfere".
The first key vote on Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, the senior head of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many were driven by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves of 6m (18 feet) hit the shores of the sunset, bringing many to a certain death and destroying everything on their path.
After the 7.5 earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB agency for intervening in the disaster of Indonesia in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, dragging cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea with a speed of 800km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centres in Palu.
Photos of air released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that energy released from the massive earthquake Friday was about 200 times more than energy released from the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow shore, is possible to strengthen the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "volume" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the ass of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a post, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floors of a building shouting insanely, warning people on the street about a tsunami approaching.
In a few minutes, a wall of water crashes into the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power cutoff that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to co-ordinate rescue activities.
The military started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While the staff of the World Vision of Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in cerady shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as the relief groups began the dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to come if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a hole for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how, when the news began to circulate about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliderist community, he was desperately sending messages to WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended with only a gray tickling mark, instead of a son.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26.750 in cash-charging ATM at "Newport of Cayote"
Thieves stole 26,750 dollars from an employee in Brink's who was supplementing an ATM at Newport's Key, according to a press release from Newport's police station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: rapper changes his name to Jay
Rapper Kanje West changed his name to Yeh.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature previously known as Kanje West".
Forty-one - year - old West wore the nickname Yei for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to cancel "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said the word had religious meaning to him.
"I think 'egg' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," said the News at the beginning of the year, discussing the title of his album with radio operator Big Boy.
"What does it mean I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left Kanye, which means the only one, up to Jei alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of the many known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former West associate, J.Z., also uses his name with or without a cartoon and all capital letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico's VD President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would "never use the military as a repression of the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to students and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States should double research funding in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the U.S. government made statements on artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number one in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"Doubling the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Li said in an interview with CNN this week.
Li, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houndon Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest-ranked American kidnapping player and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee thanked for previous U.S. government technology competitions as a challenge in the Robotics Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when the next match will be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of science by artificial intelligence," he said.
The China State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation is funding people in academic institutions similar to how the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organisations spend money on researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an Authorised Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, they currently invest more than $100m a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission for the Security of Artificial Intelligence had no effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requirements for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and boycotting campaign doubted whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The referendum paper issue said, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13.00.
However, turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The poll, released last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, showed 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
To succeed, the turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero in Manchester City spent the entire Brayton defense goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton’s defense in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Ethyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between the three Brighton defense players before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four “greens. ”
He bypassed a defense player before he ran several others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then handed left of it to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right side of the network with his right foot.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you scored in that moment."
But the initial advantage of "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the prime minister's league.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he took Sterling to the far-off stage.
The attack on the "heavenly blue" put the ball into the net before it got out.
The city will fight Hofenheim in a match of the 12.55 Champions League on Tuesday at the Raine-Necar Arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rockys.
Since Nationals were eliminated from fighting for the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Sherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still implications for playoffs for the Rockis team, which are leading a match ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockis' team had at least a wildcard for a 5 - 2 victory over Nationals on Friday night, but they still struggle to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we are not playing for nothing, at least we will be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals are still due to announce a starter in a week, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Sherzer to throw into such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start 34th time, was training to throw on Thursday and tossing normally rested on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand man is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike points in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Mythins for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation over his choice of Brett Cavanaugh for the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' turnout in early elections.
"Everything we have done so far will be put at risk in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I am not running, but I am really fighting, so I am everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, seeing wickedness, insolence.
They don't care who they hurt, when they need to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and interfere".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, rude and untrue".
He mentioned Senator Diana Finestein of the Democrats' ranks, set up by the Senate's Judicial Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with a cry of disfavor.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Ah, what.
No, no, wait a minute – that was a very bad body speech – the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Labourists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When the activists of the Moment in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in line of members of parliament from the Labour Party to which we are told that we are not welcome – just because he is expressing his opinion.
My fellow parlementary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement has criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with earlier leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham's East Labour Party stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party's parliament, council meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "lighter, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the labor party, and any opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never otherwise take, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media calling for conviction, a denial of the policies of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the labor party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the labor party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for "no trust" or a change of the rules for selection, the party becomes with closer opinions.
I have received many counsel over the past two years saying to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not why I came to politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the labor party as a student, provoked by the government's lack of concern that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed them, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes down to Bregzit to hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the labor party.
But I have one message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how many judgmental threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeated Air is heading to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderful entertainment match of the day of the Scotland Football Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved opportunities, carried by the home team, and Coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose stated: “Praise for Ear, they have made better use of their chances than we have. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Air a head start, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Voriors, enabled Melrose to improve numbers, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted point.
Climo extended Ear’s lead with a penalty, earlier, exactly at halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17 - 5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose got off to a good start on the second half, and Patrick Andresson's point, converted by Bagott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruardid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and from the beginning, Air continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDowell, converted by Klimo.
Ear's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for an extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team threw up and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to knock down Klimo without the ball, McPherson took a touchduan from the penalty line on the back of the sharp attack on Air.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took the hit of David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
Still Game Star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Star of Still Game, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move to the catering industry after it was discovered that it was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series, which is screenwriter and together plays along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
Duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last season and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Kregling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, though Scottish Sun's source suggested Kirnan was trying to join Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the covert-falsified naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the motto: “The sea is rightly ours.
It is our duty to return."
Through landy Bolivia, the memory of the shore lost in Chile’s 19th - century bloody conflict of resources is still fresh, as is longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the largest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and calm and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision taken by the international court on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of native origin, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not rule in the favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favour.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to assign Chile to decide that it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments suggest that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have reversed Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the problem of the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of rebooting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to believe that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to the declaration of ending the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest shops in your vicinity
If you want to improve the size of your hat collection or completely block the sun, then don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway you blinded on Fashion Week in Paris.
The highly impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eyes of the runway.
The piece that was highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide bead in the form of feathers that flooded the model’s head.
Other too large additions included zirconia watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment full of glasses and a diving tube, and another looked like a melted corner of ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that giant hats can come to shops near you.
The big hats came very quickly after "La Bomb", a straw hat with a barbed two feet wide, carrying everyone from Rijana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cool fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation after the runway, a straw bag for a beach of almost equal size to the height of the model that pulled it.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia board and a white leather handle, was the piece that was highlighted in Jacqumus' La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity Styleist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused such a great influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for over-addition."
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding test results, which is only being stepped up by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement customized school programs, we see modern languages as still popular and desirable as an electoral object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, he will do so in a courtship.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since this year's recent test results, we can notice that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students learning foreign languages achieved a higher score of "5+".
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young ones will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen as an electoral object at the same level as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes, as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the Committee on Employment and Skills of the OK in 2014 noted that for the reasons that employers made for failure to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter which career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically favour the polyglot over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults from the OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to talk, and the French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important in the OK when looked at in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future will bring.
At present, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the country's future, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be viewed as “International Communications Skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will take the Lakers to a debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait almost ended for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in the first pre-season game Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's gonna play, it hasn't been decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," the Lakers' official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play limited time.
After training at the beginning of Sunday, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pre-season at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for the Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of myths as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled myths in the coming week, including visits to favored places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation of his election to fill the Supreme Court's empty seat is on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans can lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you view it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Time zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia on the Internet with live feeds on YouTube.
This week, it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who has become tense due to charges of misbehaving from a sexual nature with an expected delay in the Senate vote until one week, while the FBI's investigation continues.
The primary goal of a series of myths is to help the Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
Thus, from President Trump's campaign, they said the five myths next week are aimed at "incentivating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible as possible as the start of the difficult campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be named.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to Metro from West Virginia.
Saturday is the second visit to Trump to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisei that the president must come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team shows courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one - sided seasons, the fours on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what Cup Ryder needed.
The curvature of happiness is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're a little lucky I guess," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of leading four points and another twelve games.
According to Spit, Americans feel they have a weak wind in the sails even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spitt was excellent and led by example.
Those strong celebrations grew stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to a leveling of four or four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His blow to the 15th was welcomed by a similar cry, telling you that he believes the American team is not out of the picture.
"You just have to take a deep breath and worry about your competition," Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable story of Cup Ryder.
The strange but wonderful Europe duo is four out of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple without bad punches Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad blows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine Friday morning.
That series and the way it seems to flow their energy to and from this noisy group ensure that they are the players who will win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Flitwood or Molinars.
It's preferable both at the same time to different holes.
However, talks on European fame remain unwarranted.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he joined Alex Noren.
A missed blow and two doubles from the first nine buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they do not follow, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership in the last day, but the season of four also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, suspected.
The Europeans led by 10-6 on the last day of Cup Ryder
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of Cup Ryder after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the two-win attack while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy you lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team, which had many failures in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans resisted the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't get the lead.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points of 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After they "smacked" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the worn-out Woods and US rookie Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, played great at moments, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested as morning double couples lasted, returned as Henrik Stanson's partner in the fours with defeat 2 & 1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kotka -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive victory of 2&1 over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in double couples and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost in the initial, two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cup Ryder, a particular team has recovered from the lack of four points in an individual game, although as bearers of the title, Furik's team has had enough equal results to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says there is “no way” to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepening mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country will give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" in last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, decommissioning nuclear test plants and obliging against nuclear proliferation and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints of Washington's resistance to accessing nuclear disarmament "in phase", under which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to working towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to give in to strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Rie did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not end up in such a dead end."
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles towards the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" with a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "complete destruction" of North Korea, much more commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "It takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "Sanctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exceptions until full, finally nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time has not been well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea is committed to meeting with Moon this month for disarming a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "adequate measures".
He said Kim told him that "the appropriate measures" he requires are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight growing macho learning culture by staying up all night with caffeine.
A researcher discovered that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about basic self - care.
Charles Chaisler, a medical professor at Harvard Medical School and Women's Hospital specialist Brigham, designed a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic results, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of a dormitory where students press on coffee glasses, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and about how inadequate sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine in going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," Professor Chaisler added.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even in order to avoid thickening, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into fasting mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student town.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competent institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that is broadcast from electronic screens and the LED light, which removes the circus rhythm, leading to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal brought down Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Stephen Gerard's dismembered team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team won the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as the manager who left his team with eight points behind the rogue leading team of Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time, and Rangers' setup lost its inspiration and chances of evening out.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston has gone on third, and they're only behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after Line Judge Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for head injury after he was apparently hit with a distance object.
Gerard has made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semifinals of Cup Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingston who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy with the way his well-trained class was suffocating opposers every chance.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
It was supposed to score, two minutes after the start when Menga's first play put Scott Pittman down to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-row player missed his chance.
Then the impact from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute he and Stephen Lawles clashed, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not signify the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but the former goalie of Ibrox Liam Kelly did not suffer from the head blow of Lassana Kulibali and the weak blow of these Edaria.
Although the beginning of Livingston's 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' blow again.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga as a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his blockade line.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hacket caught a lot of long-term additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on a corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty request since he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson did not approve again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor · Global Voices
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday of the morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE OFFER ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the gamer counter.
Since then, it has become a major strength of science, the gamer's counter has become a major foothold of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bell of Colorado", which features those seemingly unconvincing, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that again? ”
Rogers: “It is a gamer counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactivity into minerals."
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name and so forth exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch ” decommissioned cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch ” the stray cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the alien cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory
You can “see ” protein honor in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The test vaccine yields promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify the alien cells, the cancer of ovarium has disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can “watch” protein honor in many types of cancer called HER2 and then return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Institute of Bethezda Cancer, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarium, lungs, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells works when treating a certain type of leukemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp outfall, wearing a hat with his motto, after a show Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast Saturday night, after a useless performance praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that evening, called Ghost City, in which he wore an inscription to make America Slavna again, he began criticising the Democrats and repeating his support for Trump.
"Friendly when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday, evening live show started with a satire of Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Cavanaugh in front of the Senate's legal affairs commission, linked to charges of sexual assault on Christine Blazey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the video of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that it was hard to get behind the stage because of his drop.
"Behind the stage, they made fun of me.
They said, “Don’t show up with that drop. ”
They made fun of me!
Then I was told I was in a submerged place, he said, according to Washington Exzeminer.
The news continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" he said he would "put his superman hat on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments attracted disdains from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show seemed embarrassed, Varajetti reported, one man told the publisher, "The whole studio is lost".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many by performing the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for the support of the crowd. ”
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was his own and it's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for which I believe he accepts and spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Caine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, also known as Puff Didi, Puff and P Didi.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist from previously known as Prince.

The star of the Trons game, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a master swordsman as John Snow in a violent, medieval, fantastic series of Trons.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #I am now saying.
Kit, who recently married the game star of the Trons, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" on the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we sin with manhood?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood, thanks to powerful male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by TV and what on the street makes young boys feel like they have to have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the extensions of the Game of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he "ending up battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will perform in the restoration of the true West of Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Game of the Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a guy who had a love attraction with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic show that won Amy's awards.
The two are married in June 2018 on Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 800,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread through some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who had HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Junan.
Year after year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sex is an acute issue to the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination of LGBT community people is high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will once marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data presented by a member of staff related to a Republican party senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had released personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on the pages of Wikipedia lawmakers.
The L.A. Democrats assured that claims are on "ultra-right" sympathisers and websites.
"Lying, lying and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech of Utah.
The information appeared on the internet Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel ran on charges of misbehaving against Brett Cavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court judge.
The information presented shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Preservative locations such as Gatesway Pandite and Redstite have announced that the IP site that identifies the source of the post connects with Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff has been released, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"These denials are nervous," Flysher wrote.
"This shows that she does not have a temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he mustn't be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not wonder about the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Democrats related to Judge Cavanaugh, who was indicted by critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent institutions and police of false claims.
"We will allow offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and will be legally responsible for all of their actions that are harmful and dangerous for some and all of my staff".
The thought of Johnny English strikes again - undermined the spy scams of Rouan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for elements of Bregzit in every new film with a British connection, and that seems to be true for this renewal of the franchise of the fraud, action comedy Johnny English -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Will careful self - mockery of how clearly we are in the balance of being the new export opportunity of the nation?
Despite all that, the person with big eyes and many faces of the incompetent Johnny English has been licensed to "frozen" things for the second time - his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, designed for cinema viewers in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts to carefully glamour after a bit resembles Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bean and a part of the boy who plays a note from the Kochii song at the opening ceremony in London 2012.
Its foundation is the traveller and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now forgotten Barclay TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor's feathers hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor looks weak and somehow superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy accidents aren't as inventive and focused as the silent lessons of Bin's Atkinson character.
The theme that has been going on all along is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of an agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
On the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combat figure and already suffers from a complete melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this character of quasi-Tereza-Mei, but there is nothing special about the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a private school, but "black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all the stuff in the Royal Secret Service, they're back in action and they're meeting the fatally beautiful Ofelia Bulletin, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odysseus of absurd actions: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they make desolation after they smuggle themselves onto the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English starts a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the house of Volta.
All the brakes have been removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there's a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a part of his talent?
Labourists deny plans for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week -- but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "response" with the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be more prone to workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking member of the party told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a working week of four days is an drive that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary elections campaign.
However, aspirations have not been accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to grab the power of "the directors without a face" and "professors" in the utility companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deductions" because of unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of company boards and to create inclusive property funds with 10 per cent of private firms' capital belonging to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, is making a statement on "60 Minutes" as to whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh might change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least a week and has been up-to-date on the matter of whether the bureau's findings may reconsider some Republican senators withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, "60 Minuti" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"Anyone she named could not confirm.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring celebrities and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held seven times, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of a project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a telephone call or another useful piece that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Golbal Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert really a way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-aktivism" - people who feel like they're making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed they have registered more than 19 million "activitys" from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to identify dedication and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and hints resulting from their activities, 10 billion of which have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children take advantage of their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with insufficient food in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Food Power said before the crowded people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been taken on calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding of the project, the power of nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the often asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will not succeed.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Li Fournes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
Washington can "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has discovered, as Washington Ezeminer quoted him as saying.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a front for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that seaways remain open and if necessary by blocking their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organised by the Energy Consumers' Alliance, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while talking about Russia as a "unfavourable pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" North Stream2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Moscow a "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of the pipeline at 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance ran into resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industrys (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will look closely" at whether to run for president in 2020, Masacusec senator said
A senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the election in the middle of the mandate.
During a meeting in the town hall in Holioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the town hall and said he "leads the state in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as the Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that many voters in its electoral unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Masacusec's "likely" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the University of Saffolk/Boston Global Centre for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination and 48 per cent against it.
Other known names from the democratic party discussed with the nomination in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Trek Paylin's posttraumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally.
Trek Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and indicted in a domestic violence incident Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I know how the other families who are torn apart because of the more traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told an audience at a rally on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "are coming back a little different, they are coming back solid, they are coming back and wondering if there is respect for what they and their fellow airmen have given to the country, and every other member of the army has given it to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by a female attack, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vassilla Police.
18 federal states and Washington city back challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker challenging politics, En-Bi News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender, representing Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum claims in the United States originate as nations with constant gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls a decision by the 2014 Migration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public defender, Washington's Carl Rasin, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of laws at the level of federal states, federal and international level".
"Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to a petition to the court (amicus leciae).
In addition, defenders in the letter claim that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their country of origin for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Seshns said in a political presentation on June 11th.
The asylum was never meant to solve all problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby in an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes and choose from their listed objects to save something they can.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-magned earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Tears were in his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the fifth - floor hotel room he was in with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China for "malignment" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily by listing the benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China's paid addition to China's Tea Daily in De Moin Register -- the best-sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US congress elections on November 6th, China dismissed the indictment.
Trump's indictment that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked a joint US service for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce commercial promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war that level the import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, who support the Republican Trump Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda advertising in our free press".
"In the desemination of propaganda, the government of China abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing ads in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China has rejected his offer of publication" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans step away from women's voices ahead of mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already been said to want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no turning back,' wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell College at the University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said he suspected that the pressure to investigate the FBI of Senator Jeff Flake (Republician from Arizona) would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "Noembru" in protest in the Senate's hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs commission, decided to continue the nomination of Cavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony, said Mick.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they are tall; that's true.
But they may be higher, especially among independent women's voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggest there may be negative consequences if republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to the EN-BI-Si news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Cavanaugh will go to the hearing, it's about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that assists in the choice of Democrats, the news channel.
However, Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, although many accept the first-time page.
A new Yu-Gov poll suggests 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or probably trust Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations brought by Ford, as well as at least another one, of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in front of the Senate's legal affairs committee, under oath last week that Cavanaugh was intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court judge of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Network, starts with a start-up business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legend project in technology, Inrapt, is a company built on an open-source platform called Solid, on Berners-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do this now," he told the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "net data storage" or a shortened floor.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluk, Sleek and Spotify to make all available to one viewer at a time.
What is unique about personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a particular type of information.
The company calls it "personal data strengthening".
Inrapt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a deal to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications by using tools available on Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of the world network of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesman for the Internet's neutrality debate.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the consortium of the world network, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the internet," Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: A Known Carrier of the Victorian Cross of World War I · Global Voices
The only English church priest to receive a Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, honorary Bernard Van received his confession on September 29, 1918 in an attack against Belengliz and Lehaukur.
Yet, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military medal.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandkids at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather got the medal.
According to London's Gazeta, on September 29th 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Channel de Saint-Quettin "Through very thick fog and under strong fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the shooting sites and led with “the greatest courage ” ahead, before attacking a cannon nest alone and disabling three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I can never fulfill, but it's something that makes us modest".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give".
The fans of combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead received Pepa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Belator 206, not having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The list of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six with the main card shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., except Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the British viewers remained appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Pigs.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of battle.
One of the fans on Twitter described the transfer of child cartoons as "a painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of Belator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa Pig", yes"
The president of Belator Scott Kuker said he will work on a schedule that will include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about playing again, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we transferred, we got a lot of messages and none of them were favors.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number to five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of the fans, and we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "they're all not like me"
Speaking on Radio 4's first edition of Discov on a desert island presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the long-standing Kirsty Yang show took several months off because of the disease.
Appearing as a secondary figure in Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else while growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me power and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexuality.
An Olympic with two bronze medals has become a famous supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man -- US film maker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar, who was 20 years old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was connected to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father did not accept to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say "you won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I simply knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- jumping to the home audience of the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride from Heather Small - who turned to his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he still had difficulty.
Discs on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, a horse is out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mikaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Championship Ryder game, but will have to change its shape to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Michelson, who plays the biennial event, the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double couples and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of attention, as often represented by the United States, the five-time winner, he shared the time to cheer and practice his game, in the range, with the hope that he would fix what is holding him back.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National playground, where distant rough strokes are a regular penalty when heeded.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mikaelson, in the ninth match of Sunday, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in pair with beginner Tommy Flitwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans, missing four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, the Mickelson game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the celebrities and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went like that, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He likes to dance, like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna be past Nick Falldo's record for the most played matches on Cup Ryder on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Cup Ryder where he never reached the best results in his individual career.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven half, although Furik said his presence was carrying something immaterial on the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's resourceful, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun playing with him, as did this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead to individual matches in the last day of Cup Ryder can easily turn into a certain position.
The Dane debuted at a match in Walderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "were crossing the finish line with only noses", with at least a 14-13-pound lead.
"I remember we had a great lead in Walderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost in Walderama, when we won for a bit," Bjorn said, picturesquely, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going to be ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play right.
This is not over as long as the game is going on.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
I say all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side -- the best players in the world."
He added Bjorn satisfied with the results of his players on a heavy golf course: “I don’t want to give premature assessments on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We have individual games ahead of us tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then you test all the abilities as a golfer.
It's a message to be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he needs to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they played in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the last day's changes, because he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment starts in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We're setting the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McLroy's most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the boys because I think that's how we'll cover everything," Bjorn said of the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed again
The German Navy's latest frigate was scheduled to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated warships from the Cold War, but it will not happen until at least next year due to wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rainland-Faltz, the leading ship of the new class frigates Baden-Vietmberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the daily DiCate, calling for a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014 but the problematic issues following the delivery hampered the fate of an ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Vietmberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth-technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is the rarest maintenance -- it should be possible, the newest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power across the oceans -- will be out of date by the time they enter the service, DiCate notes.
The frigate with an unfortunate fate F125 reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to a ship builder after delivery.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of key "superver and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because ships of the Baden-Vietmberg class will have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and restricts the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rainland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - a rise from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's reduced maritime force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem deteriorated over time because old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Vietmberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust taps the secret life of bats
A new survey of property is being carried out in the Scottish mountainous areas in order to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help manage future protection activities.
A study of the National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow the ordinary and soprano-Lilies, as well as brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameramen will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
En-Ach-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all videos will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
Then a map will be made of dwellings to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a nature protection adviser at En-Ti-Es, hopes the results will reveal which areas of living are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development that affects beds and the loss of dwellings.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky strips for flies and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
Yet, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on Triv property in Damfris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Triv," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He stresses that it is important to check whether there are bats before real estate renovations are done because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, torture, or harass or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the bat protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn much about bats and other species, we simply don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers will sue Germany's magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called rape allegations "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, which has released the charges.
Portugal and Juventus's attacker is accused of raping an American, named Catherine Majorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her 375,000 dollars to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spigel said on Friday.
Speaking to a live video on Instagram of its 142 million followers, hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything is good," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the accusations they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damage due to "moral damage beyond the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the charges took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anonymously, according to documents submitted to the court in the region of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent ” of“ a good boy, ” but he gave in under that “one percent. ”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was an agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to a deal without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge and was concerned "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to amend the treaty because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and moved this summer to Italy's 100m-euro giant Juventus.
Bregzit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Bregzit, said business minister Greg Clarke.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britain told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Bournaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border congestion in the case of Bregzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The plant in Bournaston -- produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"According to me, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be an end to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, the CEO of the Toyota in Bournaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain voiced concern about how leaving the EU without an agreement would operate cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, Be-em-we says he's gonna close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "right on time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a break at the border that, according to industry, could cause delays and shortages in parts.
It will be impossible for the Toyota to store more than a daily inventory at the Derbishire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "rightly done to avoid such border checks".
"We should have an agreement. We should have the best agreement that will allow us not only success in which we will enjoy the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC's Radio 4 programme today.
"The evidence not only from the Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
The Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Bournaston for 24 years and has been a representative of the union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House said
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" because the fight over Brett Cavanaugh's nomination as a Supreme Court judge continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Muller's work, which investigates Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential violations of the president's laws.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender, thus jeopardising Miller's independence, prompts gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was considering carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with reports released last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a conflict at the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which will further postpone the Senate vote.
Trump Sara Sanders' press secretary appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been established, could be held this week, and could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things go and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists at the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said a small number of briefings are not due to a lack of affection for the "great influence" of television journalists, though he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have considered those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this more often, and you are witnessing that we have been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system regarding fears related to Bregzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire to remain behind Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering costs for resolved EU citizens' status applications operating in lower-level public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their citizenship.
The colleagues from across the EU and more widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi is undergoing emergency surgery after having suffered head injury
Christian Abercrombi, a defensive player (linebacker) at Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury at the match Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the side line of the playground and just scraped on the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombi oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in a stretcher and took it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in red uniform in Tennessee State following a transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five knock-offs Saturday before he got out of the game, resulting in a total of 18 knock-offs this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying properties in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry expects the move to raise up to 120m pounds annually, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to secure an affordable home and focus on those with high income.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to boost the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount, which besides the current administrative fee, includes higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120m pounds annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-citizens of the United Kingdom, which has led to price hikes and has caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to engage in this process of buying property for home.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This new policy was announced only weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut administrative fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices of land-holding properties, but did not use it and urged Mrs. May to change the access homes quotas in order to repair the "frightful home situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive home reforms, including housing controls and ending evictions without justifiable reason.
He also wants the advice to give them greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my prime ministership to the return of the British dream, or life to be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes in just as easy a way as the valuable British people.
The dream of owning your own home for many has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland" · Global Voices
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "find ambition" was in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club that is currently in third place in the first league with only three points less than the club on top.
This summer, he moved to "St. Mirren's Stadium" after returning "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish prime minister's league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat, and that was it," Ross told the Scottish "Sportsound" on "BBC".
"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always something pulled me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Attorney, David Moyce, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the prime minister's league?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the prime minister's league," he said.
"It is not an easy task to bring this club there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I return the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, in which he entered his career after working as assistant manager at Dumbarton and after 15 months of engagement as part of Hearts' coach staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the third league drop and returned St. Mirren from losing the title in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls taking over "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because it was going well, I made enough money and enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever during my entire adult life."

According to one survey, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs that are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "Suntime and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of pubs increased by 2.8% and restaurants decreased significantly.
The decline in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants worsened in June.
Pubs and bars that mostly sell drinks have seen a much larger increase compared to previous years than restaurants where decline was observed.
Pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the sun’s periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, drinking sales increased by 6.6 per cent during the month and food sales increased by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst from RSM, said "These results follow the trend we saw in late April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly striking as a complement to the current pressures that generate costs.
The long warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for local owners who mostly sell food and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much needed exhale."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the stalemate in the announcement of new brands.

One in five children has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents and teachers.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News increases fear that such profiles publish sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" profile that shows their parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, has created a profile of social media that hides it from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photographs are shared.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile that they show their parents, and they also have other private profiles.

A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Chiefmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secretive.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" of the "Scottish Athletics" board
Elid Doyle was selected as the executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and President Ian Byty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the lead in this sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has great respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help to the proper direction of sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200m and 400m titles at the Atlanta Games in 1996, besides winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games and now appearing regularly as a commentator of the BBC, could not go after having suffered a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show whether I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was arduous, but I was able to recover completely, I could go back and practice agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows caused division of opinions on the Internet
The company for the production of breast pumps caused a division of Internet opinions when it announced an ad in which breast-feeding mothers were compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the quietest breast pump in the world", the user-oriented technology company Elvie has published a funny ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of haystacks whose lyrics sound like this: "Yes, I milk milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't seeds, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pumper, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts. ”
However, the advertising that was posted on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it emphasizes the dairy industry's "happenings".
"A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stolen from them only a few days after they are born," one of the comments reads.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra (‘Elvie’/ ‘Mother’)
Another comment is: “It is understandable that this is both traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A really inappropriate ad."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was truly “funful. ”
"I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breast-feeding.
It made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a genius product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad intended for mothers who milk milk (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like “cows. ”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house as they milk the milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR at Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is indeed a revolutionary product and deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk and dairy cows, we wanted milk-milking using pump and the challenges that bring the same to the centre of attention, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Yakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly although border crossings at the monthly level remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of jeopardizing their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child’s sponsor.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, senior immigration and customs officer last week testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons do not have prior criminal record.
"In fact, 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to process children quickly, authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them will be required to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to present their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered uncanny to receive relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely to ignore the signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends may increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem urged Syrian refugees to return home, though the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory under the pretext that they were involved in the fight against terrorism and "will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the country's territory destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of Western countries" of "bending irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stand in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish accord prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draw up an honest constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem has determined the conditions for participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump to win second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential term, which most liberalists probably hope, is interrupted by impeachment and scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency final ever seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the strike-time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and has almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that Fox News on average has 2.4 million viewers in prime time, which is 1.7 million more compared to four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" by MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is announced.
"This is like the fire people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designed Survivors" drama of ABC for cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capital was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skowl, a veteran in comedy writing and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he's really funny," said Mrs. Skovel.
There's a certain fun value in the whole mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roy case against Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you're no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been looking at a panel of experts that debated the use of a $15,000 "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a bomber jacket of skin by Paul Manafort's Noisy of $15,000 ("fat arrogance clothing," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Trump's anatomicals.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"A part of what he does and what gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show is that he brings you something new every night," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's rotating team and daily shifts (carriages with NFL, praises for Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching "MSNBC" while recording on CNN.
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Inflow of external funds in the narrowest mid-term elections in the race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Congress Area receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganisation of congress areas from which there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is being run by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another area of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kit Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th Congress area, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th Congress area.
Maps have been changed since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old areas have been manipulated in favour of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congress area is a difficult contest to finance campaigns among party main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congress Committee for Campaigns (DCC) and the National Committee for the Republican Party's Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the 18th Pennsylvania Congress Area election held in March with wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador for support for China, and then quit
The diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of Trump's organisation.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only with regard to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
Proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and murder rates in it.
As the internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they want the conference to advance effectively and put an end to any thinking on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal thinking of the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing you know is the release of Special Advisor Robert Miller's report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign has been linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the assembly of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to re-emerge before the voters and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many insecuritys here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it for his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unstoppable march of democracy has accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What do we do if Mr. Trump resigns to Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot seat after the newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly filming the president and speculating that he was unsuitable for the post he performed.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in "The Times" is incorrect.
"What will we do if the new investigation of Brett Cavanaugh requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for a Congress that Mr. Trump will accuse in the middle of the elections?
If we fail all these tests, democracy awaits her long winter.
But I believe that this will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath at a table with a swastika logo.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers with an optimistic attitude ahead of the "Rapid Vienna" clash
"Rangers" are hosting a clash with "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, and are aware of the fact that after the game against "Villarreal" in Spain at the beginning of this month, victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-row player due to knee injuries, was prevented from showing up during the season until the unsolved game 2-2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a springboard towards greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We have entered the game believing that we can achieve something and come back with a points.
We may have been able to give a little more at the end, but the unsolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
We have another big European night ahead of us on Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll get back and we'll get a positive score.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened, or my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope now we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women can't sleep at night because of this pension-saving fear
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they talked to their mates about long - term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care unless you have a moment to share your wishes with them.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Please include your financial adviser: your advisor may also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or secure a self-insurance by your own means, if you have them.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out the full power of healthcare so that you can empower a person of confidence to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the potential for your financial resources.
In this way you would choose a person of trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines he is taking and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asks.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from his exit.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act".
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are appealing to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Because of the interruption of communications, relief workers cannot obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5 - degree earthquake's epicenter.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Further, several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300km (180 miles) on the coast of the northwestern island of Sulavesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy, Central Sulavesi, especially in Dongala's coastal region.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moravali on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit and west Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawa, close to Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake with a shallow focus hit Paddy Jaya County in Aceh, causing desolation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen structures.
2018: Big earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for family violence charges
Trek Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin's oldest son, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, a consensual report released Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Matt-Su detention facility with an opportunity to leave if he pays $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when he was asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to prison for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with B-class violation, I fined a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case in front of Alaska's veteran court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in a report on the crime of domestic violence and possession of alcohol weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after saying her son's violent behavior stems from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulavesi, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media is circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for suspect in New York terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that hasn't been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle road on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan and run over the pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to a report of the intention to seek a death penalty delivered in the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death penalty on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and purpose," prosecutors said, with the way Saipov carried out it described it as "ugly, cruel and depraved".
"Sifoulo Habibulajevic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state's intention was reported.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death sentence case was prosecuted in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 grounds of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, instead of accepting a plea of guilt, and to impose a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence earlier asked prosecutors not to seek death row.
Party MP Tori says NJEL FARAZ should be in charge of Bregzit's negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the party's "Tori" conference promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former Ukip party leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's MPs proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
conservative supporter Peter Bonn at a march in Birmingham said the United Kingdom would "be out of the EU by now" if Mr. Farage were a secretary for Bregzit.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in terms of unifying her deeply divided members was highlighted by counter-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bregzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Cekers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregzit persons, counter-Bregzit persons and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bon said at the "Leave Means Leave" pro-Bregzit rally in Solihal that he wants to "refuse the plan from the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now," he said.
The MP from Welingborough added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the plan from the Checkers."
Voicing his stance against the EU, he said, "We have not fought in world wars for now to be subject to.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, also attended the march and told reporters: "I am simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Cekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who are due to our victory in the elections.
Please give up the checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a targeted message to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said at the assembly that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to hand over Bregzit, and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has enabled us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit faces marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly in the city centre.
After the group's assembly, a small number of activists who wore banners titled "Torijevci v Bregzit" appeared this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked conservatives for security issues they faced at the opening of a conference on the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for the border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is no thing called a good Bregzit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he "will think twice about running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe announced that a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future during the town hall in West Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's re-election against Republican party representative Jeff Dil, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holioc was its 36th meeting with voters since Trump came to the presidency, whose maintenance uses a city hall format.
One of the audiences asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top."
Suspect arrested for the shooting and death of basketball player Simms from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team was arrested on Friday.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Ditéon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the East.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Soutern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result of it died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, "247sports."
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, owned a weapon, and fired at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a 192-centimeter-high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played in 32 games with 10 hits last season, i.e. on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caught balls after the match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to world title after the team gives him victory over Sebastian Bethel
From the moment Walter Botas qualified before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a big part in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton at bay while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered the boxing first and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action one of the one that forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the inside of his free risk of staying away after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly get to the finish and outrun Kimmy Raiconen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44th round boxing but could not increase the pace in the other eight rounds, so Raiconen came to fourth place.
It's a tough day today because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has made a truly exceptional decision to have its own couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestein at Saturday's rally about her insistence that she did not post a letter from Christine Blassy Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh of a sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were " mean and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and evil and ruthless and dishonest," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks of information, they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finestein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Financial with information on charges against Kavanaugh by Ford as early as July, and was published in early September, but Finestein denied that the leak of information came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish her story," Finestein told the committee, announcing "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their debauchery, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to step on to regain their power and control," the president said as the "Mediaite" announced.
Elite League: “Dundee Stars” 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in the competition against "Dundee"
"Dundee Stars" compensated for the loss of the Elite League framework match Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dandi on Saturday.
"Giants" took advantage of two goals reached by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host before Dwyer returned the lead to the Giants.
Francois Bushar equalized for "Dundee" before Lucas Lundvald Nilsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season within the Elite League for Adam Kefi's boys, who retaliated with victory over the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides in the season, with "Giants" winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., by adding Kendall McFol, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Sullivan provided the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to achieve the score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that "Giants" took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them again with a powerful game and goal, resulting in 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time secure Dundee's leadership in the second-term competition and he secured his team's victory in half the last half of the fifth match.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next game Friday at the Milton Canes home court.
A flying controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane escape from the earthquake
A flying controller in Indonesia has been celebrated as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people safely fly.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong sequential earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But while his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey airport in Palu, which was constantly rocking.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's plane with a flight number of 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesman for "Air Navigation Indonesia", said that that decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be taken to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of victims may reach thousands, and the disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even be accessed," said the spokesman for the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho agency.
Waves that reached six metres have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Quartar assistance carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets everywhere have been robbed."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini plane crash now says one man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated on the plane that fell into the lagoon in the Pacific in Minnesota now says that one man had disappeared after saying earlier that the 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated by a sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and others were able to cross the water that reached half of them and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port’s reconstruction also helped rescue, with the aid of an inflatable ship carrying people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in accidents by PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst established a time frame on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted the jury's use of phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, said "The Clarion Ledger".
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to refute this genre's negative attitude by including positive messages in his music.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that the hip-hop has moved away from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their resuscitation through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?!
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a “racist ” message
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired on the grounds of discrimination after a mistake received a message from a mother who complained about the fact that she was “another black woman. ”
The married couple deny being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion".
Linsy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016, following the first day of work of the new nurse Giselle Morris, she learned that she was black.
"No, no, no, no, no." Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "comfortable" she had fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had done her job badly and had instead expected the nanny to be of the Philippines, she announced "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350-a-day layoff for six months, an engagement that will include her living with her family, what she was originally hired to do, but without making a deal.
"I want to show them that these things should not be done," she told "Post" on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The married couple retaliated to charges of being racist, saying that Mrs. Morris's dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told "Post".
"But would you trust your children to a face you have been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying that the lawsuit was a "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had the baby only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you attack someone in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Padington publishers fear readers will not be able to connect to a talking bear, the new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, stated regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book first before it is published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington's huge success.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a small bear-shaped book, would still be optimistic if his work had not been well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But since you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost as if you had a child who had reached something in life: and you are proud of it even though success is not due to yourself.
I think Paddington's success has seen it that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always credited the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to say that the situation is very bad and that she is expected to not survive," said Mrs. Edin-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that the doctors gave her to maintain the pump of her heart slowly decreased and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit back and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm."
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz mourned the loss of her daughter boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieved women lay cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
"They all remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it'll have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to them and who can talk to them, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you need to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davis' long-time friend, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eyes at all and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death is a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to go through this: “That sort of thing is destroying the family.
He leaves us broken.
But we must keep going and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future has been uncertain since the FBI started the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time investigation, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "is falling apart" under the rooted partisan's impasse.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is due only to timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, or on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, meanwhile, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has been "declining" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has dropped since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Bjeong-seug Park, quoting data from the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, said there were 1,127 crossings at the border last year compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs for human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea eventually gain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Korean people illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where there is the longest border with North Korea and which can be easier to cross compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them into force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stalemate of negotiations on denuklearisation.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho accused the sanctions imposed by the United States on Saturday of stagnation in progress since then.
"Unless there is confidence in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security either, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysteric" and said that if his temper is considered he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did so, they would say she was "hysteric," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional about his inauguration, sometimes even yelling and crying while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling allegations against him "the grotesque and co-ordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is evidence that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has proved to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think she disqualifies herself with those statements and the way she attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to take Kavanaugh off the post if allegations against him were confirmed and the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth in front of Congress or in front of the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she is concerned about the possible verdicts Kavanaugh will bring against the Law on Access Health Care or Roy versus Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Cavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger that she can't free from without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “A woman who worked as an executive somewhere helped me, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated is when I once started crying with unspeakable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager who I always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach out to you."
Patricia Schroeder during that period was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on a ship titled "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well thought out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and Seven Dwarves.
Given the fact that the campaign was launched long ago, she did not have enough funding, so she promised not to enter the race if she did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 each would give her just $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During a speech that announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overcome by emotions, or thanks to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me, you'd probably have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the event.
"You would have thought that "Klinex" is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can be a good thing for Beijing
Opening fire with the start of a trade war between the United States and China was deafening even though the battle is far from over, the clash between countries could be useful for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation significantly escalated during this week by introducing new $200 billion (150 billion) goods tariffs, which effectively taxed half of the goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has every time returned to nature, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return the United States to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays out well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis as the interdependence of the two economies will decrease.
"The fact that with a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing, conditions can be created for the start of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any country is much more dangerous than previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the New American Security Centre, which is a tin tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee returns, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has remained devastated since the long war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renovate areas devastated by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that reflected on their everyday lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime welcomed the aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe achieves significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team in the Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a European field and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe has recovered the primate since Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, led the ball into the water in a couple-3 to the 16th hole in his first blow, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was prominent in all circles, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 after the tournament in the current format began to be organised in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest-ranking European team player, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most prizes in the 25.5-point tournament during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been really hard this year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," the emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He now gives up his countryman John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, score 2:1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
It's about the amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 big titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has been working all weekend to direct the game towards low-grass terrains, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik said, after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
During a period of time this morning, we made it difficult for the team from Europe.
We fought.
Drop down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them credit.
We've been outplayed.
