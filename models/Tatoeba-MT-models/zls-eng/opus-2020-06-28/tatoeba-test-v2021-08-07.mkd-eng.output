I prefer goat cheese to cow.
I prefer eggs from a half-breed.
I prefer black.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I'm sure I sound ridiculous.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
I punched a box in his jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I drew the word “Alice ” to point it out.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I gave up.
I'm growing goods.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like the wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss cooking for my mom.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I like to learn French very much.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the Queen.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I spit one out.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with them all.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
- Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Are they all happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or banana?
I've got my head on straight.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to get her home.
I need to pack.
I should go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed my room.
Did you go outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatseba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on his face.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the Chun.
I slept on a bus.
I cut down the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this just too much?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day cleaning the snow.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mom?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
That means "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfying?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place available?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still can't be trusted.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love the horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Does Tom die of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is it bothering you, Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I say we go home.
I'm starving to get you down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I doubted it that way.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you even if I was burning and you were the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to pick up.
It all makes sense.
It all seems aimless.
It always happens the same way.
Can't be any coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
That's not possible!
You're the one.
He did a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
You didn't bother me.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's a disappointment.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
Doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; either way, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
I guess it's not helping.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I'm fine.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made myself very clear.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'm gonna be okay.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty good.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake if you borrowed Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we had to leave.
I think I've made a mistake.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think it's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom is mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a stickler.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a tough guy.
I think Tom's in vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough to eat.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're freaking out.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should deal with this on your own.
I think you've done enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd get him some help.
I was going to ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was doing it.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you'll have a job to do.
You didn't like the prize, did you?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you could swim?
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd be living with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in a lot of pain here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
It's a multiphase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'm gonna do the job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is dead.
It's starting to get in our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a well - known paragraph from his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It was funny-looking.
Looks like you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
Seems familiar.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
Looks like these two are dating again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
It's made me sick.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It might seem strange.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetric.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you so.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this would get painful.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I've been in the room.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
It was raining two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I'm truly sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check that there can be negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medicine they prescribed for you.
It's a child's game.
That's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's over.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost got to go.
It's really fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risk plan.
Too bad the concrete's not on fire.
It's fast enough on foot.
It's a simple job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He's been decomposed.
It's just a pain in the ass.
It's been a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and fake than be pessimistic and right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's time to close.
It's a studio here.
It's generally known you're not fond of Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
It's easy to tell them apart.
I guess I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
Seems to me that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's how you need it.
It's evil to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressing up.
It's darkening.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get cold.
It'll happen soon enough.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's good.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take us long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel someone needs you.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't have much priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light here to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a printed mistake.
It's obvious to all of us that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
That sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's a bust.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's too bad.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's awesome!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not right.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like a kari.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
It's really strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
You can't handle this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It relaxes a lot.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I don't care.
There's wind.
It's work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to blow up.
It's been all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and directed it towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It's been an early day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
All right, you were here.
Everything was so easy.
It's been an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my duty to spend the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
That was an amazing experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a hot night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was awful.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
You were having a good time.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been shown that dogs’ fleas jump higher than cats do.
It was magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
It was blowing up a lot.
It was amazing.
You had to.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was irrefutable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a shot.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't do you any good.
It's good work.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk by tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to hear you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote down everything that was meant to be written.
I already wrote my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone helping me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overworked.
I turned this whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.
I've been betrayed.
I've been briefed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was reckless.

You'd better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserved better.
You'd have done the same thing in my place.
You did a bad job.
You've done a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about that, right?
You've already done that.
He did his best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
They hurt you, right?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't have who else knows how long.
You don't have to be insane to work here.
You know what I'm talking about.

I pay my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't thought about it, have you?
You haven't seen one of those, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?

You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be fine.
You're gonna get confused.

You'll be my guests.
You'll be notified in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get them back.

You're coming with me and a dot!
You're gonna have to ask him about that.
You're gonna have to study harder next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never see you in that club.

What's wrong?

You look very handsome, Tom.
You made some money.
He gave his word.
You're worrying me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
You might have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.

I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.

We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.

You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.

You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all our money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You're out of alcohol.
You've got too much to do.

You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're wrong, Tom.
Your eyebrows look strange.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
Your health is very important to me, so why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's a good memory.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is difficult.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your pronunciation is almost accurate.

Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty hot.
All your stuff is here.
Your wishes are my command.

That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call back anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were texting me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You see, you already know the answer.
You look like you're cold.
Looks like you've got an infection.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You should ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Don't overdo it.

You sound very safe.
You got your ankle up.
You're so beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird because she's not white.
You traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're backwards.
They got you drunk.
You've been through a car accident, but you'll be fine.
We missed you.
It was of great use to us.
You're right from the start.
You've made white again!
You bought Mary something.
You defeated me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
You overdid it!
You have a rash.
You're busy enough with worry.
You got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me give Tom a message.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You made Tom miserable.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen worse.
You've been postponing this for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to survive the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not like you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You did great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You worry too much about him.
I wouldn't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
