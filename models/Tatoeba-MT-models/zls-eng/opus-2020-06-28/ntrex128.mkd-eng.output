Wells National Assembly members are worried that "they look like Muppets"
Some members of the congregation are amazed by the proposal that their name be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this can be an object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party is concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not speak Welsh: in Welsh, twp means “stupidestest/stupid”, and pwp means “how. ”
Plaid's member said the party is "unhappinessful" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party's works were "free" about changing the name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" (ang. Muppet) was great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is similar to that of the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on which any words by which members of the congregation will be appointed, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave Wells the power to change his name to the Wells congregation.
In June, the commission announced the results of consultations with the public on proposals that provided great support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Welsh parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultation.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus may cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill for changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members of the assembly and design for the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their title when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in a bid to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's bells shrunk as the Harlem churches face problems
"The historical, old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, neither of them are here."
He said missing bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in another way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer living rooms in the neighborhoods where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started from".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings filled with a type of people that will not help the remaining shrines in the settlement.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "so the day will be accelerated when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built from white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis -- a metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodists congregation moved away in the 30's.
Black congregations that practice their faith nearby take possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the sellers on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillone.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly referred to the carillon as "the ring of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part of which was brought by non-skilled church leaders and a part of the bishop's diocese.
The church board - the church’s governing body, composed of non-skilled leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese “will require the transfer of expenses” to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some parish members have complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old when diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock near the beach of Beacon in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he first thought it was a thrill of catching lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I was bitten!
He bit me!’
The whole clavicle looked at him," Hammel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the children's hospital working in San Diego, seduced as in critical condition.
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The beach savior, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but decided the shark was not of a dangerous kind.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torza.
Authorities closed the beach on the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles has noticed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Super Comrade and Debenhams with beauty shelfes in the style of stock houses full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant market in beauty in the United Kingdom weighing 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales continue to decline, large branches of beauty will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, and will be presented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
An investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of the shelfes once designed for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its own Boutique makeup series, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Craydon, southern London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and tending to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury's, said the shops would increasingly look like stock houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discountes with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's began to store Argos in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which according to them increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganise its beauty and pharmacy department ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement over how to split profits from chemical assets stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celeste, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty shelfes to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be able to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "infuriated" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound deal
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den went "wraged" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11-million-pound deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their product brand Truly and household accessories.
The couple's business is linked to the Goop brand of Guinet Paltrow.
This 37-year-old head of the morning program told Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their profitable life-style branding business at the last minute to focus on its new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when TV's gold girl admitted during a tension meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean that she no longer has time to devote herself to their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
Business is linked to the Gwineth Paltrow brand and has been said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones soon left Britain for one of his cottages.
One source stated: “Truly always tops Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-lasting future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all those affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
Marlow headquarters have a warehouse full of products that are ready to sell."
Experts believe that the departure of this morningtime program manager, one of Britain's most paid stars, can cost the company millions because of large investments in pillows and candlesticks, to clothing and household products, and because of the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years now.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the ambassador to the brand for M&S and replace Ann McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebry.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We don't comment on his business exploits."
Serious Talking “And Then Falling In Love ”
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media to comment on what some would consider "unpresidential" and because he is so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice disguised as "representer of the news".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's denauklarisation.
But the negotiations for de-sclerisation have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ry Young Ho, told world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States for North Korea's early moves to disarm.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We agree well with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results -- completed missile tests, helped release hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd before him.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was displaced, no major disaster was declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children, ” a team is putting together to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if it will allow international agencies to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that keep affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling through many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A medical ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims has headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign focused on improving Indonesia's old infrastructure, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the face of the election next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
See: Daniel Starge of the Liverpool team equalled against Chelsea
Daniel Starge rescued Liverpool from losing to the Prime Minister's League by a goal at 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to the Starge at about 30 yards of Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before he directed it to the remote pole.
The ball moved high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumpy Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starge told Liverpool.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I was just kicking."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored the goal in 25 minutes.
The “blue” attacker passed a fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the ground, and then sprinted into half of Liverpool.
They quickly passed with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then set up a missile, taking Hazard to the 16th.
Hazard passed the defense and defined the network of the remote stairway with a left foot impact next to Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples in the group phase of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake victims and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into an earthquake of 7.5 that struck on Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a shot from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mercside, was found this morning.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with a stab wound to Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Brian Ohagen stated: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenheed who saw or heard something suspiciously contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesman that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in an object.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and as police have said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no entry, no exiting the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants were now told that it would be hours before they could turn back.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that now the whole area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She keeps repeating “it’s so terrible. ”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was out.
A number of cops were standing in the cordon watching the flats.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous crime fighters at 0800 555 111, quoting a record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament became the latest memory blow in the fight to "rewrite history"
Its persecution would be a poetic justice for his "Falsian" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, stated: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure at the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the works of his forefather, Thomas, in the previous century.
The wonderful presentation of Cromwell to Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th - century opinion and part of the historical image that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of the parliament of external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it's a fully accurate play is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer tore apart and killed a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a market farmer in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only after his last name, "Juan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near the market in Liupanshui in Gicou Province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pig farm pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xinging in Kinghai Province, China.
He appeared to be traveling with the cousin of the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door of the neighboring pig’s cognac.
He stated that there was a big boar in the coven with blood on his face.
The forensic survey confirmed that a 550-pound boar broke off the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said my cousin, named Wu, according to the quote in Gwaiang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Juan's family and market managers are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked humans have been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig impaled a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring torrential rain to the southwest United States of America
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves across cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane of 5.00 Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression has begun over the Pacific Ocean and is heading east to the west coast of the United States as Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to bring a large tropical moisture north into the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up 10 inches of rain to Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropic moisture with the approaching depression will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause rapid flooding, a flow of ruins, and possible skating of land in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rains that in some places will be approximately two to three inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Maximum 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most Arizona.
Rapid floods may be caused by rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to go to the desert on foot in the possibility of tropical rain.
The torrential rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will lead to a local flood of rain in parts of the South California coast.
Rains of more than half an inch may be possible, causing rivers from ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rain will expand into "four corners" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected throughout the United States due to Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of a dramatic difference in temperature will exist in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
It is expected that most of the central and eastern United States will have a warm start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the peninsula.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our forecast for the longer term points to the possibility of above average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly took place in the 1980s, Kristina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the free political situation continued, with speakerships breaking regular shift programmes at the last moment of Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that he was 100 per cent sure Kavanaugh was picking up a piano and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen announced, saw Friday.
The company counted on average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties measuring people who look at offices.
To show better, it is an audience of the size similar to the playoff competition in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavanaugh's appointment, led in front of all the networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the entire hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After moderately issuing a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him as protesters calling Friday morning while he was trying to get in the elevator for the trial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was reprimanded, all of which was transmitted live to CNN.
"They're standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks were all covering hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote for the promotion of Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do it if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the allegations against the nominated next week, which was demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and with a few senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had great significance, as it was obvious the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on the coast
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the loan costs is "totally absurd".
Fire at Wade Simms: Police arrest suspect Ditheon Simpson for the death of an athlete at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diteon Simpson has been arrested and detained in custody for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a CBS partner said.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he confessed to shooting Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The parish pathologist's office in eastern Baton Rouge announced a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department thanks to Louisiana's state police fugitive unit, the state police crime lab, the South University police and citizens in the area for aid they gave in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for its "activity in the search for justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot beet grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the basketball team at the state university of Louisiana, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Sims's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," the coach said.
Vulcan throws ashes at Mexico City
Ejecting ash from the Popocatepetel volcano reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go to the volcano after the crater's activity began, and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The centre followed more rumblings and earthquakes.
Social media pictures show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City’s settlements, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists noticed an increased volcano activity of 45 miles (72km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters of independence clashed with public order police and after thousands joined in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by public order police threw eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fighting broke out, and the police used their thumbs to stop the fights.
For more than a few hours, independent groups shouted, "No forgetting, no forgiveness," and on the other hand, union protesters shouted, "To Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local press said.
Tensions remain high in an independent region, one year after Madrid characterised the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, although the turnout was low due to a boycott of people who are against secession.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
Demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
The sixty-eight-year-old electrician, Narcisse Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance to gain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamics of this year with many of their most famous leaders either in self-elected persecution or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording a police-support protest, said the conflict was backed by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before a trial last year, announced he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested After Getting A Car In House · Global Voices
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after driving a car again in a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the building itself.
At some point it may have been shot with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Advanced Livingston has signed the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed to one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's country lost its victory in the championship this season and will face leaders of Harts next week, behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the six-game division, and Coach Holt still has not faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed a chance against cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they scored the goal, and their directness caused a lot of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but dragged the attack around the goal, and then Alan Litgoev could only point his efforts away after he slipped the blow with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
Guests gladly let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could create problems with their actions.
And that's how the crucial goal came.
Rangers missed a free blow, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga together, who only touched him gave a goal from the center of the 16th.
By then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but could not penetrate the defense of the hosts, so goalie Liam Kelly did not play most of the game.
The scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos is a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the skills of the Rangers' goalie, Alan McGregor, and Litgoev took the ball away from another set-up action of Livingston.
Livingston's 16-year-old was constantly passing and was repeatedly defended, while two penalty claims -- following Halket's challenge for Glenn Middleton's replacement and one handball player -- were rejected.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and score for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was remarkable, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on the line.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as Gerard once was, they are now lagging behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and it is a small awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Colonja
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They deteriorated because of problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons as saying they were trying to prevent a 25,000-strong crowd from the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdishs also pleaded, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposite protesters paint the division of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident en route to Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A Velosipedist died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of the streets of Bestud and Evelyn, a traffic accident with a major rumble in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and came to an ambulance, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist died in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver fled about a mile from the Saturday crash.
Metro police have said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been placed and buses have been diverted and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Larythin Prison: Six Police Officers Hurt in Disturbed
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-level male prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Martin in Worcesshire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Special Forces from the Tornado unit were brought in to solve riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited in one wing.
The cops are being treated for minor injuries on the scene.
Prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to handle the ongoing incident in HMP Long Larythin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for this will be handed over to the police and may pass extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, public order police were called into prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for droughts)
It is rare that tropical depression will hit Arizona, but that is probably what will happen early next week when the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state-run meteorological station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, down to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be on a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The state weather station in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Centre for hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the edge of the Mongolian.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rockies Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are outside the risky areas of rapid floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to benefit because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Monitoring Authority, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category," said Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path led to ground sinks all over Mexico's Lower California Peninsula.
Rosa, still in hurricane power on Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with freezing waters in the Pacific and is shrinking.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours of Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
"A rain is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," Weather.com said.
Rose will then move north through Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move upwards through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening hours Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains are many heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States," the state hurricane centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and waste streams, as well as landslides in the mountain regions.
Midsamer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if someone had the cell phone footage from the incident to step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the greatest wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the Democratic Party's most cruel and scandalous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the biggest wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Thursday's convention, strongly and emotionally denying Kristina Blasi Ford's accusations that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and for her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican exits in early elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I don't run, but I do fight," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump said Democrats have a mission "to give resistance and to hinder".
The first key vote on Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, and the total number of victims increases
At least 384 people died, many were taken away from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves of 6 metres (18 feet) hit the coast at sunset, treating many as certain death and destroying everything on their path.
After the 7.5 earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB agency for the intervention of Indonesia's disaster in the Jakarta briefing, said.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, dragging cars, trees, houses, hitting everything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at 800km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 1,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and torn bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPT) said energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released from the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The city's geographical position, which lies at the end of a long, narrow shore, may be increasing the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shot of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be further along the 300km (180 miles) coast north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a post, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday that it had informed us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said waves came at about the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared by social media you can hear a man on the upper floors of a building shouting crazy, warning people on the street down the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a power cut off from communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened just for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had plans to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia rose over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in tarpaulins in their office's yard, they went through scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's too bad.
Even as relief groups began their dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign relief experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to come if the site of the disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be wonders that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been locked under her thumb for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state team for paraglidera, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paralyzing, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how when she began to circulate news of the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa in the paragliderist community, he was desperately sending messages to whatsApp's competitors from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of ticking instead of a son.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26.750 in cashing in an ATM at "Newport of the Cay"
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26.750 from an employee at Brink's who added a ATM to Newport's News of the Key, according to a press release at the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While busy, another man ran from Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed His Name in JJ
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yay.
He wrote on Twitter on Saturday: “The creature formerly known as Kanje West. ”
Forty-one-year-old West wore the "Yei" nickname for a while and used the nickname for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande for a show that had to cancel for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although he used it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said the word had religious significance for him.
"I think 'ej' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with radio-man Big Boy.
"What does it mean I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Yeh alone, to the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of the many known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Dede, Pi Didi, or Didi, but this year he published his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
West's former associate, JZ, also uses his name with or without a dash and all the capital letters.
AMLO, Mexico, promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's V.D. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repressions on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlateloko Plaza that "he will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
The military fired at peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people in the time left-wing student movements became entrenched in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funds in the field, said the investor and practitioner for AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Doubleting the funds may double the chances that the next major AI achievement will make the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 80s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked US player of the kidnapping, and later was the director of Microsoft Research and the head of the Google branch in China.
Lee thanked himself for previous competitions in US government technology as a challenge in the robotics of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when the next match will be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that takes academic leaders, it is corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that "green cards" should be automatically offered to doctors in artificial intelligence science," he said.
China's State Council issued its Roadmap for the development of the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's State Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organisations are handing out money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should cover partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that required the creation of a National Commission on the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not acted for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is laying down the right to its territory and vetoing its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and boycotting campaign doubted whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the referendum's validity.
The question of the referendum ballot said, "Are you up for NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow bodies such as the EU and NATO to enter Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia broke down.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Djorgyevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in Macedonia's referendum on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018, in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The poll, released last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Thelma TV showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed Brighton's entire defense for goal
Sergio Aguiro and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Ethiopia Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot to look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean attacker received a lift in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed three defense players on Brighton before entering the open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "green".
He got around a defense player before running several others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then passed left of it, on Sterling.
The English attacker used his first visit to the 16th to return Aguro's ball, which with his right foot beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City Manager Pep Gvardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to give you the goal at that point."
But the starting advantage of the "heaven blues" has given Sterling the battle for Prime Minister of the League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before he took Sterling to the remote pole.
The attack on the sky blues brought the ball into the net before it came out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the League of Champions' Group in 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rain Nekar arena, Germany.
Schercer wants to play the spoiler against the Rockies.
Since Nationals were eliminated from the fight for the playoff, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Schercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for playoffs for the Rockies team, who are leading a competition in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western national league.
Rokis' team had at least a wildcard for a 5-2 victory site over Nationals on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
Nationals still have to announce a starter in a week, but they're reportedly inclined to let Schercer throw it into that situation.
Schercer, who is about to start 34th time, was training to throw a throw on Thursday and throw away usually on Sunday.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike points in 220 2/3 innins this season.
Tramp Mitins in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation over Bret Kavano's election to the Supreme Court as he talked about the importance of Republican exits in early elections.
"Everything we've done so far will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, you see wickedness, impertinence.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "to give resistance and to hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the angry, the wicked, the rude and the untrue".
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein from the ranks of the Democrats, set up by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, in which the audience reacted with calls of indignation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute -- that was a very bad body speech -- the worst body talk I've ever seen."
Labs no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When current activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in line of parliament members from the Labour Party to whom we are told that we are not welcome – just because it expresses its opinion.
My paralementary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement was critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement of the East Labour Party meeting of Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party's parliament, the council meetings on Friday night were just the same.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "gooder, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, once began.
It becomes increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is considered acceptable to the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to change my thinking completely and to take views that I would never take otherwise, whether it was national security or the EU's internal border.
Whenever I speak out loud, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical harassment of social media that calls for condemnation, denying the centre's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this kind of experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great awe for professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request to "no trust" or to change the rules of selection, the party becomes closer to thinking.
I've received a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then, "it's gonna be all right."
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since 32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by Tacher's government's carelessness, which literally left my classroom to collapse, I fought to improve public services for those who need them most, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way with my political views and areas of dissent with ongoing leadership.
To those who supported Friday's request, all I want to say is that when the country comes to Bregzit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Moment, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how judgmental or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeated Ear Goes Top · Global Voices
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph in this beautiful entertainment match on the day of Scotland's football championship.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved used prospects, which the domestic team carried, and Coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Praise for Ear, they took better advantage of their chances than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear a head start, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was given the Vorios game, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed an unconverted point.
Klima extended Ear’s foam leadership earlier, at halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to achieve 17 - 5 for Ear when he was saved.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Andersson's point, converted by Bagut, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, which was carried out on a stretch, and from the start, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford McDoval's point, converted by Klimo.
Ear's V.D., Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted point of Bruce Colvin at the end of his time with ruthless pressure.
But the domestic team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to bring down the Klemo without the ball, McFerson takes out a touchdown from the foam line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klima converted, as he did again almost from the start again, after Kyle Roe took David Armstrong's hit and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the domestic team.

"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia Collegiate with Land Hopes Court Will Re-open a Path to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling a cover-up Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to get him back."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the memory of a shore lost in behalf of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail again after the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the greatest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
" Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision-making of the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign sea exit to Bolivia.
Here comes Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also heavily depends on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean," he said in remarks in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chile territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have taken back Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that making a court decision is unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other", he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the problem with the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States of America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ree spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during a summit in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong Un.
Ree says it is a "fiction" to consider continued sanctions and US objections to the declaration of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first to take substantial disarmament measures.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion audits reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest shops in your vicinity
If you want to improve the size of your drop collection or completely block the sun, then don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy too big hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that blinded the style set up on Fashion Week in Paris.
Ultimately impractical hats triggered Instagram this summer and these designers sent their designs falling into their eyes on the runway.
The piece that was highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige cap decorated with a wide blade in the form of feathers that flooded the model’s head.
Other too large accessories included watermelons with circuses, a wizard's hat, or even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creation resembled full dive equipment with glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted cornet ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
The followers of style predict that huge hats can come to the shops near you.
Too many hats came very fast after La Bomba, the straw hat with a wide two-foot edge that brings everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cool fashion house behind too much impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation along the runway, a straw beach bag nearly equal to the height of the model it was dragging.
The dark orange rhafia bag, with a bordure of Rafi and a white leather handle, was the piece that highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on Fashion Week in Paris.
The style of celebrities, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and the beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive accessories".
John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exams, which only enhances with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement tailored school programs, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable as an election subject in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he will do so in a fervent way.
If you talk to him in his language, it will hit him in the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
Of this year's recent test results, we can see that languages exceed all other items with the highest rate of success in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of "5+".
The figures, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an electoral subject, are seen at the same level as STEM-subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools programmes, as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the Committee on Employment and Skills of the OC in 2014 noted that the reasons for employers’ failure in filling jobs were 17% due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming more and more indebted in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter which career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot before competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to talk, and the French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of the people.
So investing in teaching languages is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the OK when looked at in the future by 2020 as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future will bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the country's future, so this must be taken over in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it must be done).
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will lead the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James run for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James is going to play in the first game of Sunday's presession against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes is he going to play? It's not yet decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training early Sunday, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pre-season of this phase of my career to prepare myself," he said.
A Yu-Tub channel for a Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has started a series of myths as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five scheduled Trumpian customs in the coming week, including visits to favored places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to confirm his election to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans may lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is tonight's Trump rally in West Virginia and how do you view it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., an hour zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia on a live broadcast on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address the hearing of a man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misbehavior with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to a week, pending an FBI investigation.
The primary goal of the series of customs is to help the Republicans get a swing for the November elections.
Hence, President Trump's campaign said that these five customs next week are aimed at "incentivising volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control in the congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as the beginning of the hard season of campaigns," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign for Reuters, who refused to be named.
As scheduled in the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to Metro, West Virginia news.
On Saturday, the second visit to Trump in West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not good for Morris that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Coup Ryder 2018: United States team shows courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the start of Sunday's individual matches
After three one - sided seasons, the four of them on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The twist of happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're a little lucky I guess," Jordan Spitt said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of four points and twelve more games.
The Americans according to Spit feel that they have a weak wind in their sails even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points of four.
Spitt was excellent and leads with an example.
Those strong shouts of celebration became ever stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the levelling of four-four when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His blow at the 15 was welcomed by a similar cry, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of play.
"You just have to get deep and worry about your match," Spit said.
That's all every player has left now.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesca Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but the wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
Molywood was the only single without bad blows on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad blows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and how their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are players who win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's preferable to both at the same time on different holes.
However, talks on European fame remain unjust.
Bug Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he joined Alex Noren.
A miss and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch from the close because of interaction between partners, the advice they give themselves, the advice they disobey and the way strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership in the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's leadership in double couples and fours from 10-6 to the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and the Francesca Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who was struggling to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US team that had a number of missings in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans resisted the four, winning two matches, but couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points of 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, are the second couple in general to win four points in the first four competitions in the history of the Buyo Ryder.
After they crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in double couples, they played great and beat the worn out Woods and US rookie Bryson DeShambu with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods who pulled through two swords on Saturday, played great for moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning double couples, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in four of Dustin Johnson's 2-1 defeats and Brooks Cop, ranked first and third in the world.
However, Europeans were not all after that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the double couples and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in four, but lost to the starting, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Buyo Ryder have a team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as holders of the title, Furik's team was satisfied with the same result to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says "there is no chance" of disarming unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the world's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, disabling nuclear testing facilities and committed itself to proliferating nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a suitable US response," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ree repeated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament "in phase", under which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ree alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general at the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to working towards "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump gave a guarantee on the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to yield to strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal with coercion and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Rhi said.
"The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end up in such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ry's speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the American land was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for that, saying "It takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue completely and without exceptions until full nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to hinder the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo already visited North Korea three times this year, but last time didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that he had made progress, but was denied by North Korea just a few hours later due to "gangster demands".
North Korea committed to a meeting with Moon this month for disarming a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he is looking for are the security guarantees Trump has given in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington
Harvard Students Visit Courses to Get Enough Rest · Global Voices
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho learning culture by staying awake all night with caffeine.
One researcher discovered that the world’s leading university students often know nothing about their basic concern.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of inadequate sleep on learning.
"A girl came to me at the end of the lecture and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said nobody, never told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic results, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students had a serious lack of sleep during Sunday.
One-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a student’s home where students press on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how unsatisfactory sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know it will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, while modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the student in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a hunger mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year of Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student city.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm on when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" broadcast from the electronic screens and LED lights, which move the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Manga brought down Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Steven Gerard's team to defeat a 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team committed the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the lost top team of the Scottish First League Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and Rangers' setup lost his inspiration and chance of evenling out.
Now the Rangers have fallen to the sixth place, and Livingston has boarded the third and are only behind the Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for head trauma after he was obviously hit by a long-distance object.
Gerard made eight changes to the Aer team at the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingston who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-trained lineup choked his opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated the property above the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score, two minutes after the start when Menga's first play went down Scott Pittman to the goal of Alan McGregor, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then a blow from a distance to Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halquet, but his defence partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their last-thirds game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thompson did not sign off on the Colombian appeal.
Rangers were able to score only two shots at the goal in the first half, but former goalkeeper of Ibrox Liam Kelly did not suffer the blow to Lasana Kulibali's head and the weak blow to Ovi Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' blow again.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which, with a cold head, chose Menga as a simple end.
Gerard reacted half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his blockade line.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play a game in which they enjoyed, with Litgou and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team was able to expand the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor was well placed and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head with Litgou.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another request for a penalty since he ran into Jacobs, but Thompson never approved again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE BROUGHT ... the day in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become the main stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 movie "The Bell of Colorado", which features those seemingly unconvinced, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactive activity into the minerals."
Evans: "Say it, it's jumping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name and then exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "watch" alien cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the alien cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize alien cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their changes to a laboratory
You can “see ” a protein honor in many types of cancer and then be returned to the body.
The vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a vaccine - treated woman who is teaching the immune system to recognise alien cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared within 18 months.
The method includes extracting immunological cells from the patient, changing them to the lab, so that they can "see" protein honor in many types of cancers called HER2 and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the US National Institute of Betazda Cancer, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a promise vaccine. ”
HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarians, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzophski explained.
A similar approach by extracting immunological cells from patients and learning them to target cancer cells works in treating certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-tramp out, wearing a drop of his motto, then performing on Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show Saturday night, following a useless performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called Ghost City, where he wore a hat with a inscription To Make America Slavna Again, he began to criticise the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"As often as I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal affairs committee concerning the charges of sexual assault on Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's failure video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had been hard behind the stage because of his drop.
"Behind the stage they made fun of me.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sinking place, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
The news continued: "You want to see the sinking place?" he said he would "put his superman hat on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments attracted indignations from the audience at least twice, and the team at the evening show seemed embarrassed, Varaetti reported, a man told the publisher: "The whole studio is out."
The news was brought as a last-minute replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many by performing the song “I Love It, ” dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
News received support from the leader of the conservative TPSAD group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for protecting the crowd. ”
But the host of the Karen Hunter show tweeted that West "was itself and it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and spreads ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kane West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi’s steps, also known as Puff Dedi, Puff, and P Didi.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dog, has the name Snoop Lyon and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist of the former known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast

The star of the Trons' Game, Kit Harrington, attacked toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of Game of the Trons.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho hero stereotype when he said such roles on the screen meant that young boys often feel they must be firm to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times's culture section, Keith said he believed "something was wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #Now I'm saying.
Keith, who recently married the star of Tronov's Game, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "powerful feelings" on the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, but what is taught?
What is learned from TV and what on the street makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not have participated in the extensions of Tronov's Game when the series ended next summer, saying he "ended with battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will perform in the restoration of the Real West of Sam Shepherd, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever came out of the Trons game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who had a love attraction with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic show that won Amy Awards.
The couple were married in June 2018 to Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/CID: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is great.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the disease’s transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the China government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data from a member of staff related to a Republican party senator as "dangerous lies" and "agreement theories"
On Saturday, US representative Maxine Waters dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia lawmakers' pages.
The L.A. Democrats assured the claims were of "ultra-right" sympathies and websites.
"Liegies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a tweet statement.
The published information reportedly includes US Senators Lindsay Graham's home address and phone numbers from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hetch of Utah.
The information appeared on the internet Thursday, released by a stranger in Capitol Hill during a panel of the Senate hearing about allegations of sexual misbehavior against Brett Kavano, nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The information reported appeared shortly after Kavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Preservative locations such as Gateway Pandite and Redsteight have announced that the IP identifying the source of the post is linked to Waters' office and information about a Waters personnel member has been published, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The article of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they mustn't be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He mustn't ask about the motives of the defendant.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Democrats related to Judge Kavanaugh, who was indicted by critics because he seemed too angry during a hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also called on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big thing," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had reported "the competent institutions and police on false claims.
"We will allow the offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff".
Thinking about Johnny English Attacks Again - Undercuting Rowan Atkinson's spy fraud
It is now traditional to look for elements of Bregsit in every new film with a British connection, and that seems to be true of this renewal of the franchise of the cheating, action comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: born again.
Will careful self - ridicule on how obviously we are in vain be the new possibility of exports to the nation?
Despite all, the face with big eyes and a lot of makeup on the incompetent Johnny English got a license to burn things for the second time — his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for the audiences in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour after a little like Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bean and a part of the boy who plays a note of the Kochi song on the fire since the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveller and the mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now-forgotten Barkleys TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the wings of the rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission and itself contain elements of comedy.
Humour seems to be intended for children instead of adults, and for me, the crazy accidents of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as the silent tricks of Atkinson's character.
The theme that passes through all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated the super-secret spy network in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of an agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combat figure and is already suffering from a total melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this quasi-Tereza-Mei character, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling yourself Johnny English who now works as a teacher at a private school, but "in black" gives covert agents classes: there are some good boys here when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is rapidly invited to Whitehall's emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Beau, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in connection with a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all the stuff in the Royal Secret Service are returning to action and meet fatally the beautiful Ofelia Buletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the perilous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a waste of themselves on Volta's luxurious yacht; and English starts a real anarchy when it tries to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the inside of Walt's house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there's a lot of kids' TV in the entire movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And like other movies with Johnny English, I can't help but think: can the British film industry play a role for Rowan Atkinson to take advantage of his talent?
Labourers deny that they make a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week -- but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they'd take the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "responses" with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more favourable to workers.
The four-day working week transition is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A high-ranking party member declared Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is in line with the party's accession to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "The four-day working week is not a strategy of the party and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of the "faceless directors" and "prostitutes" in the utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deducts" because of unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company boards and create inclusive property funds that will make 10 per cent of the private company's capital belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, making a statement about "60 Minutes" on whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh can reconsider
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has postponed his final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week and is up-to-date as to whether the Bureau's findings may consider some Republican senators withdrawing their support.
In an interview published Sunday, the 60-minute correspondence of Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was strong, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved into a stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
"Everything she appointed could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the festival Global Citizen, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; an end to poverty.
Now is the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012 is an extension of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or another useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Golbal citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel like they're making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens argue that they have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters who have acted for very different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to state commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and indications resulting from their activities, 10 billion of which have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct flow of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, Partnership of Investors and Implementation, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children use their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with the country's under-nutrition after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a record in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food, told the gathered people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been taken in connection with calls for improving the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding of the Ishranta Power project, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road — we will never make it.
But as well as the great civil and anti-partheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to block Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington may "as long as it takes" to use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky discovered, according to Washington Egzeminer.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a front for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy trading, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that seaways remain open and, if necessary, to block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinky addressed the presence of an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the stake and replace the fuel," he said, while talking about Russia as a "one awkward pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, made Moscow's "falcon".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stand has met resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kemph, the first man of the German Industry Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holyock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider running for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the town hall and said he "led the state in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in her criticism towards Trump and the man he nominated as the Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a number of voters in its electoral unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk/Bostonian Globus University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of the Democratic Party discussed on the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin is talking about Trek Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at a rally at Donald Trump
Trek Pailin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he's come back, I know how other families feel torn apart by post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told the audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paileen called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "they come back a little different, they come back solid, they come back and wonder if there's respect for what they and their comrades from the Air Force gave him for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and accused of domestic violence by attacking a female person, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasila Police Department.
18 Federal States, Washington City Support Dispute New Asylum Policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents asylum against victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington submitted a petition to the court (amicus deacae) in Washington on Friday for support of an asylum seeker challenging politics, En-Bi-Si News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a number of asylum claims in the United States come from, as nations with constant gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has annulled an immigration complaint board decision since 2014 allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Public Prosecutor Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of laws at federal level, federal and international level".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to a petition to the court (amicus deacae).
In addition, the defenders in the letter argue that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sashnes ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their country of origin for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessence said in the presentation of politics on 11 June.
Azil was never meant to be a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby at the evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes and choose from their watered objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside for frequent consecutive minor earthquakes.
Tearsy found it in his eyes when he described the massive earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "maltrating" with "propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial in a US daily newspaper listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump was talking last Wednesday about China's paid addition to China's Teana Daily in De Moin Registrar -- the best-selling newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th US election to Congress, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked a joint US service with Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial promotional ads, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war that balances import tariffs with each other.
China's vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing hurts US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Registrar, "now doubles bullying with propaganda ads in our free press".
"In the desemination of propaganda, China's government abuses the nurtured American tradition of free speech and free media by posting advertising in De Moin Registrar," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not really see the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China refused his offer to publish" the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans move away from women's votes ahead of midterm elections due to a debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are silently watching or defending Bret Kavano's nomination at the Supreme Court despite several accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans already have said they want to continue voting.
From such things there is no turning back," wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, neither in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "Noemvri is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who control the legal affairs committee, decided to continue the nomination of Cavanaugh despite Dr. Kristin Blaise Ford's testimony, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women's voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest there may be negative consequences if the republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to En-BI-Si news.
"It is not only about the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided over whom they can trust after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, although most accept the first-member side.
A new poll by Ju-Gov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or probably trust Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought up by Ford, as well as at least one, by Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified to the Senate's legal affairs commission under oath last week that Cavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses that the candidate for a Supreme Court judge showed her the genitals at a party, while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Network Artist plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Network, starts with a start-up business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company built on the platform with an open code of Solid, of Berners-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrudt's intention was "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he told the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "net data store" or a shortened pod.
It may contain contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlux, Sleak and Spotifi to all be available to a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal Internet data storage is that only the user depends on who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes and adequate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company is currently consisting of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers under an agreement to work on the project and community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralisation applications using tools available at the Inrapt website.
Berners-Li said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a statement by Mediam, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "the Inrapt mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of the World Network of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesman in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even when starting Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain founder and director of the consortium of the world network, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: Known Carrier of the Victorian Cross since World War I
The only priest to the Church of England who received the Victorian Cross during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Reverend Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belengliz and Lehaukur.
Yet, he was shot four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had received the highest British military medal.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the medal.
According to the London Gazeta, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Channel de Saint-Quntin "A very dense fog and under heavy fire by cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the shooting sites and led with the “greatest courage ” ahead before attacking a cannon nest and disabling three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make it modest".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Youth Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is manifested by the support given by many people".
The fans of combined martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead got Pepa Pig
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and you don't have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The list from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six with the main card shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., only Gerard Musassi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain remained appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Pase.
Some were not impressed after staying up until early hours for fighting.
One of the Twitter fans described the transfer of a children's cartoon as "some kind of painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of Belator for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Pepa Pig" yes
Company President Belator Scott Kuker said he would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think that when I think about letting go again, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transfer came, we received many messages, and none were kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels "inferior" Because of Sexuality · Global Voices
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "they're not all like me"
Speaking on the first show, Discovy on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular speaker of the long-standing Kirsty Young show took months off due to illness.
Appearing as a side character in Lavern’s first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so that not everyone would be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two bronze medal Olympic has become a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used its performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without division and wants to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man -- American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, on a son named Robert Ray Black-Day, and Daley said "all his eyes" had changed.
"As you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father did not accept to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life -- jumping in front of a domestic audience in the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — the pride of Heather Small — which turned to him in preparations for the Olympics and which he still had a hard time with.
The BBC Radio 4 desert island discos are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikkelson, the horse is out of shape, it was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays at the 47th Buyer, but he will have to change his form to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mikkelson, who plays the biennial event, the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double couples and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of attention, as often represented by the United States, the five - time winner, he shared his time to cheer up and practice his game, in the range, hoping to repair what he is paving.
He has never been the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow field of Le Golf Nassional, where distant rough blows are a regular punishment for recklessness.
And if the ground itself isn't scary enough, Michelson, in Sunday's ninth competition, faces British precision Open Frencho Molinari, who is playing in a couple with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans missing four points before 12 individual matches start hard, Mikelson's game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrities and he's given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's what we thought we had to do.
He likes to dance, like everybody else."
Michelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the biggest game at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's resourceful, he wants to joke with people, and he's a great guy at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun in the game with him, as was this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership before individual matches in the last day of the Buyo Ryder can easily turn into a non-stakeholder position.
The tax debuted at a match in Walderama in 1997, when a guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the line only with their noses" with the slightest lead of 14th-13th.
"I remind myself that we had great leadership in Walderama; we had great leadership in Brooklyn, when we also lost in Walderama, when we almost won," Bjorn said, illustrating, after watching the class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're leaving tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This isn't over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
All the time I've been saying, I've been focusing on 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opponent's side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn added satisfied with the results of his golfers on a difficult golf course: “I don’t want to make premature assessments on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We have individual games coming tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all your abilities as a golfer.
It's a message that should be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best. ”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they played in pairs, exceptions include Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was at the end of the changes on the last day, because he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to middle games.
We set up the line properly, and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with resisting first and facing Rory McCallroy's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter in the most important half of the order.
"I have decided to perform this way with the boys because I think it will cover everything," Bjorn said of the choice in the individual games.
New German warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not happen until at least next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Ryinland-Faltz, the leading ship of the new class frigate Baden-Wytemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the daily DiCate, calling for a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but the problematic issues following the delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wytemberg class the Navy ordered in 2007 will be a substitute for the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and Navy missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is less maintenance -- it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should allow Germany to have power through the oceans -- will be obsolete by the time they enter the service, DiCate notes.
The frigate with the unfortunate fate of F125 reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent into a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Witemberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades to the future.
Ryinland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including the crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase of initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are especially important because of warnings about Germany's reduced maritime force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem deteriorated over time because old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Witemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust taps the secret life of bats
A new property survey is being carried out in Scotland’s mountainous regions in order to discover how bats use the area in search of food.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow ordinary and soprano bats, as well as brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
The En-Aich-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using handhelds.
Expert analysis of sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the bat species.
Then a map of habitats will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, an advisor for nature protection in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are most important for bats and how they use each species.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of housing management, such as the creation of meadows and how to best maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has dropped significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development of beds and the loss of habitats.
Veterans and lights are also a risk, as are sticky flies and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
Ann-Ti-Ses, who cares about more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspection of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland of the Trive property in Damfreis and Galoway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The manager of the property, David Thompson, says the property is the perfect territory for them.
"This is where we have a great bat area in Trive," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He stresses that it is important to check that there are bats before property renovations are done because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and are illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and other species of us, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo dismissed the rape charges, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the charges of raping "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, who made the accusations.
Portugal and Juventus striker is charged with raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spigel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers, hours after the accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is false news," a five-time gold ball conqueror said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the accusations, which they called "an inadmissible transfer of private life suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damage due to "moral damage beyond the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the prosecution incident took place in June 2009 at a hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County court in Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good boy", but gave in under that "one percent".
According to the files, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judgment agreement because she was afraid of revenge and was worried "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now demanding an adjustment to the deal because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to the Italian giant Juventus with a 100m-euro deal.
Bregsit: Britain "will always regret" that it lost car manufacturers
Britain will always regret if it loses the world leader's status in the production of cars after Bregzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota-British had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at the Burnston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the border jams in the case of Bregzit would cost jobs without a deal.
The Burnston factory -- which manufactures Toyota Aures and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, the management director of Toyota in Burnstone.
Other UK car manufacturers voiced concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-Ve and Jaguar Land Rover, will function when leaving the EU without an agreement.
Be-Em-Wee, for example, says he's gonna close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics chain in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "right on time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a break at the border that the industry thinks could cause delays and deficiencies in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory of inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only success in which we will enjoy the present, but rather to seize this opportunity," he told Radio 4 programme of the BBC today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long term warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the factory’s trade union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to one government spokesman: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "sponsored for another week" as the fight over Bret Kavano's nomination as Supreme Court judge, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and a potential violation of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire Deputy Attorney General and thus endanger Miller's independence, spurs gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced Rosenstein was thinking of carrying a camera to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the publication of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid clashing with the Senate Justice Committee hearings in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet established, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things work out, and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists contest the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters in the White House since 10 September.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of briefings are not due to the inadmissibility of the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have reviewed those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, "but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that more often, and you've witnessed that we've been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and the talks with the President of the United States will replace the briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences on a visit to senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York the president may have shown why it is so by its uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the collected journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system over fears related to Bregzit
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire to stay on Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, an MP to the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of determined status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The talks between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of no agreement being reached.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress my appreciation for each member’s contribution, regardless of his citizenship.
Fellows from all over the EU and widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after having suffered head injury
Cristian Abercrombie, the defensive player of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to the "Vanderbilt Commodores", said Mike Authority of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the top coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He reached the side line of the playground and only strupolyzes on the ground," Reid said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put it in a stretcher and carried it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury" and "Tennessee State" try to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red dress at Tennessee State after the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five layoffs on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 cuts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who pay no taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters by his promises to provide affordable housing and focus on high earners.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds strengthening the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three per cent.
The ministry expects to gather up to 120m pounds annually by the move.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties were bought by non-US residents, leading to price hikes and caused difficulties for people buying property after the first time to engage in the process of buying property.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high property prices to keep the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for access homes in order to correct the "shame situation with housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and an end to emigration for no reasonable reason.
He also wants to give counsel to give greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the return of the British dream, that is, to make life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes in just as easy a way as the hardworking British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many has become too far away and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "end of ambition" is in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of bringing the northeastern club to third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer, he moved to the Light Stadium after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish prime minister's league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told Scotland's "Sportsund" at BBC.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I am successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Advocaat, David Mojs, Sam Allardic, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the Prime Minister's League?"
Given the structure and facilities in this club, it certainly belongs to the prime minister," he said.
"It is not an easy task for this club to lead there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I bring the club back there again."
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, in which he entered his career after working as assistant chief at Dumbarton and after 15 months of engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling out in the third league and returned St. Mirren from the edge of losing the title at the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls the takeover of "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, and I made enough of it, and I enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about being a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, and in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsund on Sunday, September 30 of Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British Summer Time)
According to one survey, the perfect time for beer is 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profit of British pubs that are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits are down 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services for the determination of these figures said: “The sunny time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits rose by 2.8 percent and restaurants decreased significantly.
The decline in the sale of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June worsened even more during July.
The pubs and bars in which the majority of drinks are sold have seen a much higher increase compared to previous years compared to restaurants where a decline has been observed.
The pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by sunny periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month and the sale of food by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw in late April.
The weather and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
There is no surprise that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly devastating as a complement to the current pressures that create costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the locals in which food is mostly sold and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much needed rest."
The overall increase in pub sales and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a standstill in the announcement of new brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker" is the device for monitoring the sale of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom to collect and analyse data on the efficiency of 47 operational groups with combined income of more than 9 billion pounds and is a established reper for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents
One study showed that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media profile that hides it from their parents and teachers
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News raises fear that sex content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" profile that they showed to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a social media profile that he hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut to the Instagram website where photos are shared.
News has increased fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clear "main" profile that they showed to their parents, and they had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter of the same came across a teenager who asked others to "rape him."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Elide Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" by the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle has been elected to be the unexecutive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and President Ian Byty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport's leadership to take advantage of its broad international experience over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has great respect for Elide and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board," Byty said.
Doyle said, “I am ready to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help in the proper direction of sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the titles of 200m and 400m in the Atlanta Games in 1996, in addition to the won four gold medals at the Olympic Games and which now appears regularly as a commentator of the BBC, could not go after the transition ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was a pain in the ass, but I was able to recover completely, I could go back and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
An ad for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows caused a division of opinions on the Internet
A building pump company caused a division of opinions on the Internet when it published an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be "the world's most expensive breast pump", the user-oriented technology company "Elvie" has published a ridiculous advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers who are nursing.
Four mothers dance in a barn for hay cows whose lyrics sound like this: "Yes, I milk milk, but you don't see tails" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't gaps, these are my breasts."
It continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying it highlights "the horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, except for the fact that their children are being stolen from them only days after they are born," one of the comments reads.
Elvie’s breast pump discreetly fits into the breastplate (’Elvie’/ ‘Mother’)
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A really inappropriate commercial."
Others, however, defended the commercial, and a woman admitted to believing that the song was indeed “silent. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd have bought a pump like this if I still did.
I felt exactly like a cow because of the milking.
The ad's a little crazy, but I think it's sincere.
It is a genius product," one of the comments read.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial for mothers who milk (often on their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like “cows. ”
This is not an ad that misses or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were stuck in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fits the breastplate, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leave home while milk is milked.
Ana Balarin, a partner and RDR in Mother, commented: "The pump of Elvie is a truly revolutionary product and deserves brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between milk milk milk and dairy cows, we wanted milk milk milk to be milked by pump and the challenges it brings to the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all headlines.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly, although the border crossings at monthly level remain relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made child housing difficult for sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undetected immigrants and feared to threaten their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child sponsor.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress last week that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied for sponsorship of minors without an escort.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested have no prior criminal record.
"Says 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to process cases with children faster, authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them would be required to appear in court within a month of being detained and not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their case of legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered incompatible for obtaining relief will immediately be deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in major facilities such as Thornillo, where its size makes it more likely to ignore the signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends may increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they would be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "cutting illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions were good for them to return and accuse "some of Western countries" of "stretching irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided assistance for reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Stefan de Mystura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for the elections.
Mualem identified the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying work on the panel should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump Wins Second Mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the elections again in 2020 unless an impeachment and scandal terminates his presidential mandate, likely a large part of the liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the strike time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that the "Fox News" averages 2.4 million strike time viewers, which is about 1.7 million more compared to the four-year period, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC reached the top cable rating of about 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when important news was reported.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designated Context" drama at ABC for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skwell, veteran in writing comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think it is really funny," Mrs. Skul told me.
There's a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Disfellowshipping all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when for six hours now you see a panel of experts who debate the use of the source of a "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", the bomb jacket from the skin of Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar "a dress with a thick arrogance," as it was called "The Washington Post" and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy by Storm Daniels.
I, for one, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and what gives you a feeling of how to watch a reality show is that it brings you something new every night," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's rotating team and everyday shifts (NFL fights, praises for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Face this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside of his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching "MSNBC" as he filmed CNN.
He couldn't stop looking, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was in critical condition.
"I remember we did all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."

Inflow of external funds in the narrowest mid-term elections in the Upper House race
Not surprisingly, the 17th Pennsylvania Convention Area receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of congressional areas from which there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently reconstructed suburban district in Pittsburgh is being run by Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who received a seat in another area of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th congressional district, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th congress district.
The maps were amended after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were manipulated in favour of Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congress Area is a difficult competition to finance campaigns between party main sponsors, the Democratic Party's (DCCC) Congress Committee (NRCC) and the National Committee for Campaigns of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the 18th Pennsylvania congressional election held in March that was characterized by media coverage.
For over a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area at 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador for China's support, then gives up
The diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting in June 2017 with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only in El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of around $140m in 2017, including for drug, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and murder rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar assembly last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they want the conference to move forward and put an end to any reflection on the punishment of El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pens should address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attributes to the assembly, diplomats say.
The three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of difficult messages or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is the publication of Special Adviser Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, which is currently making very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly also directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is connecting with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear before the voters again and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainty here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike Hitler if the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the following massacre.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unrelenting march of democracy is speeding up or delaying.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since the newspaper announced that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was unfit for the post he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we act if Bret Kavano's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the Congress in the mid-term elections that will accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall for all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I do believe that this will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath at a swastika logo table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of "Rangers" with optimistic attitude before the clash with "Rapid Vienna"
Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while aware of the fact that after the game against the "Villarreal" in Spain in early this month, victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in the G Group in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-class player for knee injury, was prevented from showing up in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Ringers" can use that result as a jumpboard to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a score.
We may have been able to give a little bit more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
We have another big European night ahead of us Thursday.
I hope we score three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they have a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the fans' support, we'll fight back and get a positive score.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given what happened, or my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor about the site.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it; training is good.
I hope now we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although participants in the study had a clear picture of the way they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had discussed long - term care expenses with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Company Nationwide.
Here's where you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not share your desires with them prematurely.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or provide your own insurance, if you have it.
Take care of your legal papers: Avoid legal battles at the very beginning.
Take care care care care care care care care full so that you can empower a person of confidence to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the importance of your financial resources.
In this way, they would choose a person of confidence to make the financial decisions on your behalf and to pay your bills unless you are able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the medications he is taking and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian town of Palo on Friday, officials said, with the number of casualties expected to increase.
Because of the interruption of communications, helpers cannot obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 - degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Continuing several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on Sulavesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesi Province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that extends more than 300km (180 miles) on the coast of the northwest part of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the Central Sulavesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit and hit Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is found in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Atcheh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 22,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 - degree earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most inhabited island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10m and destroying dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake with a shallow focus hit the Pedi Jaya district in Aacheh, causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourism island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the island's north side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former Alyaska governor and vice president candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of exiting if he pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definedly innocent" when he was asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be given a prison sentence for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with B-class violations, I fined a day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Veteran Court of Alaska is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after saying her son's violent behaviour stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Cyfulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence not committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle track on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists who found their way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of the intention of seeking the death penalty delivered to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death sentence on both of these grounds by the indictment.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for the purposes of racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
To carry out the attack it needed "a detailed planning and thought," prosecutors said, with the way Saipov performed it described him as "horrible, cruel and depraved."
"Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lorre Decate, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagncio," the state's intention report reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death sentence case was prosecuted in the South District of New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was committed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
Police said he told the investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police also said he asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than to accept a guilt confession and pass a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Party MP Tori says NJJEL Faraž should be in charge of Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Farage today, during a protest at the Tori party's conference, promised to "mobilise the People's Army".
The former leader of the "Ukip" party said politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's lawmakers proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
conservative supporter Peter Bon told March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "out of the EU" so far if Mr. Farage was Bregzit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in terms of the merger of her deeply divided members was stressed by counter-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bregzit that was held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Checkers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregsit individuals, counter-Bregsit individuals and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr. Bon said at the pro-Bregsit rally "Leave Means Leave" in Solihal that he wants to "reject the plan from the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
The MP from Velingborough added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the plan from the Checkers."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said "We did not fight in world wars for now to be subjected.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: "I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory in the elections.
Please cancel the Checkers plan and start listening."
In a targeted message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz at the rally said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bregsit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of handing over Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country that allowed us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit faces marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly in the centre of the city.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists came out this weekend carrying banners with the inscription "The Torievians Against Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party member, laughed at conservatives about the security issues they faced at the opening of a conference on the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for a border-free border for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is no something called good Bregzit," he added.
Warren plans to give good thought to running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she "will think well about running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe announced that the Democratic Party of Massachusetts was talking about its future during the city assembly in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's re-election against Republican Party State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event in Holiok on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump took office, in whose holding he uses the format of the town hall.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, including putting women at the top."
Arrested suspect in the case of the shooting and death of basketball player Sims of the "LSU" team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that the suspect of the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the "LSU" team that happened Friday was arrested.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 p.m. Eastern time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Waid Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result of it died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, he announced "247 sports".
Wade stepped in to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the crime scene, possession of weapons, and shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a 192 - inch - tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with the season’s 10 performances, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caught balls after the match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton Closer to World Title after the team provided him with its orders to win over Sebastian Vetel
Since Saturday, Walter Botas was qualified in front of Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From the Botas position he had a good start and almost left Hamilton in the lurch while defending his position in the first two laps and invited Bethel to attack his teammate.
Vetel got into the boxing first and let Hamilton fight the fight at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing a round later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action one on one that made Ferrari's driver reluctant to leave the inside of his free risk to stay on the side after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstopen started in the back row on the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed his car’s tires to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimmy Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing of the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the other eight circles, so Raikonen came to fourth place.
It's a tough day because Waltery did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has made a truly exceptional decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Finestein at Saturday's rally over her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and rude and dishonest."
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what has been happening in the past few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and wicked and ruthless and dishonest," he said.
"When you see posts and leaks of information and they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish... No, we didn't publish it," he added, impersonating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Feinstein concerning the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was published in early September, but Einstein denied that leaks of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story," Finestein told the committee, The Hill said.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at Saturday’s rally: “I’m going to tell you one thing, it was a really bad speech on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body talk I've ever seen."
Continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to return power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to step on to regain their power and control," the president said as he announced "Mediaite".
Elite League: “Dundee Stars” 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in the match against "Dundee"
Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League match Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundi on Saturday.
Giants gained the advantage of two goals that Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bushar equalized "Dundee" before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season within the elite league for Adam Keefi's boys, who retaliated with a victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The opportunity for Dwyer came at the fourth minute, or 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFol, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bowier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Sullivan provided the host's leadership with 13:10, before Matt Merkart assisted Cauni to achieve the score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure "Giants" took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corkoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time provide the leader of Dundee in the match late in the second period and he secured his team's victory at half the last period of the fifth.
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday at the Milton Cannes homefield.
Flight controller died helping hundreds of people on board the plane save the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia has been celebrated as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong successive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in ruins in the city of Palu.
But while his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jaffrey Airport in Palu, which was constantly aiming.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's plane with the number of flight 6321 that was at the time on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Syrait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian-based ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paloo.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even access," agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six metres devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Surprise help brings bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man disappeared after the plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline operating on the plane that fell into the lagoon in the Pacific in Micronesia now says that a man disappeared after earlier stated that 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated by the plane that was sinking.
In a statement, "Air Niugini" said Saturday afternoon they could not find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane hit a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt that the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others were able to cross the water that reached half and head for emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors operating near the port reconstruction also helped rescue a ship of bloating, bringing people to shore before the plane sinks into about 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people were killed in airline accidents registered in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini Airlines.
Analyst established the time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended by presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of the man accused that a woman in Mississippi burned her alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, said "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis erased messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is this conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to refute this genre's negative stance by including positive messages in his music.
"The High Breed" by Bristol argues that the hip-hop has strayed from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their resurrection through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racistic" message
A New York nanny sues a married couple because she was fired on discrimination after she accidentally received a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children was disappointed when in 2016, after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris, she found out she was black.
"Neeeeeeeeee another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "diseasy" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had done her job badly and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, was announcing "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day at work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the married couple and demanding compensation for the $350-a-day layoff for six months, an engagement that would involve living with the family, what was originally engaged, but without a deal.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it is discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racist, saying that Ms. Morris’s dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the post.
"But would you have entrusted your children to the person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying the lawsuit was a "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You're going to attack someone who's in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect with the talking bear, the new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond who was born shortly after the book was accepted, stated on the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Padington's huge success.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for "BBC" before receiving the inspiration to write a book from a small toy in bear form, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "a bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
About Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But because you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost like having a child that has reached something in life: and you are proud of it even though success is not due to you yourself.
I think that's how Padington's success felt.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always credited them with Padington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the "Louis Pasteur 2" hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life in vain.
"Hope called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and is expected not to survive," Mrs. Eden-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medication that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping was slowly shrinking and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit there and wait, aware of the fact that this is all happening.
I could not scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz mourned the loss of her daughter and boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immeasurable compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
"They all remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who was 11 at the time, found Tyler in 2014 after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it's going to have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "for others to let them know that there are people out there that they can turn to and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not look them in the eye at all, and he did not make any contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “This kind of thing destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, or a limited-time investigation, with a limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is "dispersioning" in the conditions of a rooted partisans-free state.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is due only to timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6th, and if, as Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers "reduced" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Bjeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unity Ministry said last year there were 1.127 border crossings compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said that the more severe border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs of human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees receive citizenship over time in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and which can be more easily passed than a well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China views these people as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stalemate of the negotiations for denauklarisation.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho accused US sanctions Saturday of staggering in progress from then on.
"Until there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security either, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavano "hysterical" and said that if his temper is taken into account, he is inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening exposure, at times even shouting and pouring as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grossy and co-ordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Cavanaugh's testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has proved to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she is concerned about the possible verdicts that Kavanaugh will pass against the Law of Accession Health or Roe versus Wade, as he is believed to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it is really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's really harsh criticism, months and years of collecting anger that she can't free from herself without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “A woman who was doing an executive job helped me very much, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she tells the person she was talking to,“You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office where men dominated me was once I started crying with inexplicable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager who had always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder at the time was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair of a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thinking decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign was launched a long time ago, it lacked enough funding, so it promised it wouldn't enter the race if it didn't collect $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 each would only give her $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign she was so overcome by emotion, or gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me, you'd probably think I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the event.
"You would have thought that Klinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
Opening the fire with the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening, although the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly during this week by introducing new tariffs for $20 billion (150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing was returning every time, or recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States with equal measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept his demands, but public bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the US trade war can result in positive support for China in the long run because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the beginning of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously established by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which is a tink tank.
Syria "ready" for refugee returns, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country left devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that have affected their daily life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe Reaches a Significant Victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European terrain and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primacy after Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, placed the ball in the water at a pair of three to the 16th hole in his first blow to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari noted in all circles, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 after the current format tournament began to be organised in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest-ranking European team player Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost two and one of Ian Poulter of England, who may have played the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a really rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is most important and I am happy to help," the emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He now gave way to his fellow countryman John Ramm, who on Sunday one beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we made it difficult for the team from Europe.
We fought.
Capa down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golfers' Association and our committee on the Ryder Cup and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it to them.
They beat us.
