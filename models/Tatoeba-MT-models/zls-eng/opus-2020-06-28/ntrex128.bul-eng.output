Wells’s Assembly members worry that they “look like mumbles ”
Part of the members of the Assembly are bewitched by the proposal to change their title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament Assembly.
Members of the entire political spectrum worry that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourists said his group was worried about the new name "roming with Tupp and Vdb".
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group is "not happy" and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party pointed out that his group was "not convinced" of the change of name, but noted that the new name CWP (in English – MWP) had a certain "mapet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to that of the English Yorkshire Pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft of the bill to change the name, made this statement: “Of course the final decision for all the descriptive names they call the members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself "Parliament of Wales".
As for its members, the Commission prefers "members of the Wells Parliament, in short "CPO", but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support since questioning society.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will seem to be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which he is expected to submit the draft bill for change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach a discussion of the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the state, has said he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's vans shut the backdrop of the Church's difficulties in Harlem
"If we look from a historical plan, according to the old people I spoke with, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today both have disappeared."
Adams says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialise in different ways," he added.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhoods where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expressed his concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not be as long as the leaders expected, “and sooner or later they will be in the same position. ”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people live who do not help to survive the rest of the sanctuarys of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as most of the new settlers are unlikely to visit them."
Both churches were built by white herds before Harlem became the neighborhood of the blacksmen - the Metropolis community in 1870 and St. Martin's decades later.
The original white methodist herd had moved out in the years since 1930.
Then the building became the property of the black inhabitants of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damages in the fire, but Father Johnson's parishes made a plan for her restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and St. Martin's heir, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural Treasure” and “Unreplaceable Historical Tool”.
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system to be ringed in the world, which was used by a black musician - Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweather mentioned that St. Martin's didn't replace him either.
What has been played in St. Martin's in the last few weeks has been a complicated story made by architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church and others by the bishop's diocese.
From the news, which is the leading body of the congregation, consisting of world leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diparchia "would have been willing to transfer the costs to the newspaper", although it had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A 13-year-old child was injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California.
Akula attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, as it dived for lobsters in California on the first day of hunting season, the representative authorities reported.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends about half an hour a morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and moving in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then he realized how he was yelling, “He's biting me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got to the boy, he found out that his whole area of the key had been torn apart.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark!" Haml added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was accepted in critical condition.
It is still unknown what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Gilles, said on a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water a shark had been spotted, but it was considered not to be a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim sustained traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
From the responsible authorities, they closed off the coast line from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Enstinas for 48 hours from safety considerations while the investigation is under way.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are, however, not a threat to humans.
Sainsbury plans to offensive the UK market for beautiful products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Super Comrades and Debenhams by opening up stand for beautiful products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK for beautiful products, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase while the sales of fashion and household products decrease, the largest stands for adornment products will be located in 11 stores throughout the country, after which, in the success of the initiative, similar ones will be found in more objects.
The investment turn in the beautiful industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use free space on the coves recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of products offered to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to those offered in Boots stores.
The supermarket also replays its boutique gamma makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try concession programs in two stores of Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Croyden, southern London last week, while the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on shopping smaller quantities of food daily in comfortable moments leads to the fact that supermarkets have to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury, said the facilities would look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury have Argos facilities in hundreds of stores, as well as opening facilities at Habitats, since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased the sales of food and has made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to re-shape its objects for beautiful and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute about allocation of profits from the facilities of the pharmaceutical company at supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with the 281 object of Celeste, which owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury, made the statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our beautiful stand to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in the special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we have offered aims to respond to each taste and all the necessary in a ravishing setting with a comfortable location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for beautiful products that challenges the concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "infuriated" after Holly Willoughby's resignation from an 11 million-pound deal
Dragons Day star Peter Jones got mad after television leader Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds deal with his Lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the household service brand and the Truly accessories.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand on Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her resignation in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones “to statue” after pulling out of their income business with the branded Lifestyle products at the last minute – in order to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "insulted" when the "golden girl" on TV admitted during Tuesday's tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is related to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow, with rumors that it has doubled the wealth of Willoughby, whose value is forecasted at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram his leaving Truly, Jones left Britain on a plane to head to one of his holiday properties.
One of the sources said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave absolutely all unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in Marlowe headquarters that is full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of "This morning" which is one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost the company millions because of the large investment in pillow and candle products and could also lead to a delay in placing the brand on the market.
Not least, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who mothered her three children, along with her husband, Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years now.
Willoughby herself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who is 52, joined the company as president in March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the "poster" of the M&S brand and will also replace Anne McParlin as the host of the "I'm a celebrity" show on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: “We will not comment on his business dealings. ”
Severe negotiations leading to "stepping up relations"
He joked about the criticisms he would take from the news channels for making comments that will be considered "unsuitable for the president" and as too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his "newsman" joke.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards removing the nuclear weapons of North Korea".
But the negotiations for the elimination of this weaponry are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ry Young Ho told representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocal attitude" by the United States towards the first steps of his country on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were on our way to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now looking forward to a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results – the termination of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of US military bodies.
He also protected his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we'd have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it is unambiguous that international aid is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," Mrs Sumbung said.
While "Save the Children" is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national disaster agency spokesman Mr Sutopo announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although tsunamis were built in Acheh, they are not often seen on the rest of the shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Until recently, stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake hospital ship headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days before he manages to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widododo turned the improvement of Indonesia's lagging infrastructure into the centre of his campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.
But the underprivileged finances are constantly harassing his cabinet, while Joko is back on the clock next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memory hit by "rewriter of history"
Its ban would be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
Ala Cromwell’s Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “crazy” and “try to rewrite history. ”
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove statues that Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to defend Parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case this is the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the entrenched division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve the appointment and celebration."
A killer pig wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwestern China market, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Juan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near Liupanshui market in Guajjou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The porcine was prepared to inject the pigs with vaccines in Sinin, China, in 30 May 2005.
He and his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan are supposed to have arrived on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next cobweb open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody trunk.
The forensics expert has confirmed that a 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reported.
“My cousin’s step was bloodied and disfigured, ” says cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Juan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack someone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Juan's family and the market leadership are negotiating compensation for the deaths.
Even though they're rare, it's been reported before about pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years before this 650-pound pig had impaled a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife was able to chase him down.
After an oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect them as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one should treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weight loss hurricane rose will lead to frequent and spillable rains in the southwestern United States of America
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves over cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rose will lead to flood showers in northern Mexico and the southwest parts of the United States.
Roses include winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, approximately 5 a.m. Eastern time and is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, the Pacific is beginning to form a syncnal moving eastward towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical moisture deep north to the south-west part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some regions of Mexico.
During the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching syncnal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, passing wastes of streams and likely landslide in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be lightning floods in fast worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It will be extremely unwise to travel foot in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to rising dust and floods.
The approaching Sinclair will lead to heavy rains in some parts along the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach precipitation from more than half an inch, which will lead to carrying small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season to rain.
On a late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin approaching Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, it can bring great temperature fluctuations to the U.S. while the Arctic Ocean cools down, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
In most of the central and eastern United States there is a warm start in October, with temperatures about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east are expected to prevail.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above high school.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the seductive maturity of the nominations for the Supreme Court Bret Kavanau and Christine Blaise Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, as networks interrupted their regular revolving programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been drinking and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his lack of emotional testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has never happened.
It is likely that even more than the number reported by Nielsen was 20.4 million viewers who saw the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has a traditional difficulty measuring the number of people who are looking from their jobs.
Compared, we're talking about an audience similar to the size of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-time hearing, reported by Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the report by Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2,89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican's office came out with a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him playing a protester while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission on Friday.
During the whole harassment for a few minutes, he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here standing before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the State?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his cabinet had already gone out with a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said he would make a further statement during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided a live coverage several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the Kavanau nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Ala Flake said he would only do it if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, which the Democrats are insisting on.
Flake was partly convinced of talks with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party Chris Kunes.
After talking to Coonce and a couple of Senators, Fleck made his decision.
Its choice was definitely essential because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "political performances" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived for the meeting of the conservative party in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the paper, her previous Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called "Lady Plan" for Brexit, citing a proposal that the collection of UK customs fees for the EU and the contrary is "fully absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the final fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and put in prison for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department reported.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, as police report that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The cops found the glasses at the scene, and they also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported from the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
Its guarantee is set at $35,000, notified by the Advocate.
East Baton Rouge's forensics office issued a preliminary report on Friday, indicating a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The government expressed its gratitude to the fugitives' search party for Louisiana State Police, the police crime lab, the police at Southern University and the local residents for the assistance it has contributed to the arrest.
LSU Director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
The average season has reached 5.6 points and 2.6 game ricochets.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU Will Wade announced that the team was "syring" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that bothers a person all the time. ”
Vulcan spreads ash over Mexico City
Ejected from the volcano Popocatepetel ashes reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity has increased and 183 wastes of gas and ash have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed multiple tremors and tremors.
Posted in social media photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in volcano activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 earthquake central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, still known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalun separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters of independence faced the gendarmes when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote to break up Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists who were not allowed by the gendarmes began to blame peacekeepers with eggs and paint on dust, creating dark and dusty clouds in the streets that usually crowd from tourists.
Later in the day, other developments with the police came along, and the police resorted to their thumbs to handle the situation.
For hours supporting independence, groups shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while those declared to preserve the country's integrity returned with "Spanish forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the October 1st referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Cataloons.
The vast majority voted to vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Cataloon authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the voting sections in the region with a number of violent clashes.
Requested independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration to support national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who joined a separatist protest with his wife, says there is no longer any hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year has been one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a standstill," the man added.
Despite the significant victory noted, however, in the last December regional elections, supporters of Catalonia's independence of political parties are having difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed captivity or are being arrested in anticipation of the process because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that “it is becoming more and more intense. ”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Cataloon leaders pending a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my bid for the European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and the repressions that we observe by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car crashed several times in a Londoners house.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has declared that there have been damage both to the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that an arbalette was fired on the car.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The senior league recruit Livingston surprised Rangers and only caused a second loss to Stephen Gerard in his first 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive, and Gary Holt's team leveled out with the second in the Hiburnian ranking.
Gerard's team remained undefeated on a foreign ground in the High League during this season, and next Sunday faced leader Harts, who left eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without loss in the championship, and Manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he changed his position to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the impeccable guests
Holt's team had to lead the result far before it scored a goal, and his direct style of game extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his blow went off, and then Alan Litgoe fired at the beam after Craig Halket gave the ball back to him.
The locals let the Rangers play ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for the guests of static positions.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and taking Menga, who took his ball and marked it from the middle of the criminal field.
So far, Rangers have ruled the ball more, but they have faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This game style continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorkeeper saved Scott Pittman's leg shot, and a blow to Litlow's head passed the door after another static position on Livingston.
In the criminal field of Livingston, however, centered centers that were easily cleaned up, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of guests for the price – first after the match between Halket and Glenn Middleton's reserve, and then also in doubt of hand-to-hand play.
"Fenomental" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland of "Tony Macaroni Arena"
A fantastic game and a great score for Livingston.
The team is playing just fine, continuing to exceed expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost didn't make any changes after the team's return to the Supreme League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he turned the team after his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the field.
Captain Halquett was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Gerard's leadership has demonstrated some great things, but in this case, they've been a lot under these standards.
They lacked the last belt before naked, and only once managed to split the defense of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets mixed admission to Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is getting cold because of problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU admission.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest group of Turks.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting Erdogan, many of whom Kurdishs also raised their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect a break caused by one visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: Koljezdach rests after car crash
A collector died after a car crash in London.
The crash took place in the vicinity of the bestwood street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, approximately 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and came for medical attention, but still the rider died on site.
The crash took place a few months after another rider died after being hit by an escaped Childers Street driver about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The City Police announced that their employees were working to identify the man, and then they would notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, also recommending that motorists avoid the zone.
Long Larythin Prison: Six superintendents were injured in a blizzard
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a male high-level security prison, the Department of Prisons reported.
The target went off in Long Larythin Prison in Worchester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British Sunday and still on.
For its purpose, special officials from the Tordano squad have been called upon to deal with eight depriveds, such as the confusion itself in a limited to one wing of imprisonment.
The injured supervisors suffered minor injuries on the person and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Department of Prisons made this statement: “Specially trained officials have been called to deal with the incident in Long Larythin Prison.
Six supervisors received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we make it very clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after the prisoner's attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October of last year, police officers from the riot squads were called to prison where they could master the heavy traffic in which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens lightning floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be struck by a tropical storm, but it is likely that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rose is carried through the desert of the southwest, leading with it the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already set up posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finisk on Tuesday, and may bring rain on late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have held tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Centre of Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rockies Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of tides possible in different places.
For those not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rose may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest part is currently in the drought.
According to the Commission for the monitoring of the U.S. drought periods, some 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second heavy category," reports weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall in the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which can still boast of the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and thus weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and can lead to a significant risk of complementarity.
"Excessive rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, up to 10 inches possible," reports Weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by late Tuesday.
"The main risk of Rose or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsamer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in Excelsior Terrace's Midsamer Norton area around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is placed in a hospital where his condition remains “stable. ”
During the night in the Radstock area, a young man was arrested at 17, two boys aged 18 and a 20-year-old male, reported by the police in Avon and Somerset.
The cops are asking everyone who might have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanau has "injured by the insolence and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the corrupt and indignation tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau had "suffered from the insolence and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blaisey Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago at a time when both of them were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "Today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, the courage and the qualities" of Kavanau.
"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanau is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president told a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly saw Cavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I am also involved," Trump continued.
"For this reason, I go around and fight to support good bids."
Trump noted that Democrats have put themselves on a mission "to prevent and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the Cavanaugh nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, as one of the co-workers of the High Representative of the Republican Party reported on CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken off the coast by giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunamis struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the coast was swept from waves up to six metres (18 feet), many to their deaths and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami burst after an earthquake with a magnet of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, which is why many have become a victim of the disaster," said a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the head of the agency for overcoming Indonesia's BNPB disasters.
"The water was brought with it by cars, trees, whole houses, crashed everything on its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami went beyond the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 km/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the air disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, broken down and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
The second earthquakes continued to swing the coastal city on Saturday.
A number of earthquakes were settled in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's evaluation and application agency (BPT) came up with a declaration that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been brought down.
The bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the ruins of the collapsed building, the speaker added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damages could be higher on the coast of 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the trusa.
He also added that "communications are completely cut and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, in turn, indicated that more than 300 000 people live there, adding that his teams and volunteers had already headed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticised for not informing about the defeat of Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Shared in social media love videos show a man upstairs on a building who yells at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the shore and addresses both cars and buildings.
Reuters has failed to verify the authenticity of the video in due time.
Earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe power failure, which has stopped communications around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of first necessity.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the Palli evacuation centers on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are now over 800.
It's an extremely bad situation.
While the employees of the World Vision of Donggal managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in the bizens, scattered in the yard of their office, they passed along a number of scenes of desolation, says Mr Doseba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
It's an extremely bad situation.
Despite the work that has begun on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some have complained that the rich experience in such situations foreign lifeguards are preventing them from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, staffing and supplies from abroad may only be started if the site defeated is declared a country of national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government announces that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status."
While the second night of the Friday earthquake and the tsunami falls over Pallu, friends and families of those still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived after the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paraplanerism team, has trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roma-Roma Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paraplannerism field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the crash of the Roma-Roma Hotel, he desperately sent messages to the competitions in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26 750 during an ATM charge in Newport to Levi.
On Friday morning, thieves picked up $26 750 from a Brink employee who charged an ATM in Newport to Levi, made it clear from a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement complex and prepared to charge it with money, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came up running behind the back of Brink’s employee ” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have spotted many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continues, but police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All available information on the suspect's identity must contact Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the Twitter change Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been wearing the Jae nickname and using it as a title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changed the Ariana Grande singer in the show, which gave up "because of emotional reasons", the creator of the show told us.
Except that it's a reduction to his current professional name, West, and before that, he claimed that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'e is' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you',' said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"This is how I am you, I am us, it is us.
The transition from Kanye, which means only one person, just Ye - who is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of many known in his sphere, who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the aliases Love and Bratter Love.
One of West's previous associates, J.Z., has also presented himself in a version with or without track and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico has sworn not to use the army against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force. This happened as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelokolko Plaza President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and has found more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double financing for the development of the IMI
The moment China becomes more active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the US must double its research budget in this area, says the researcher and developer of the IA Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various branches of the US government made statements on the topic of II, although the US in general has no official II strategy.
During this time China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from innovation in the II by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for the development of the II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are to make further breakthroughs with regard to the II," Leigh said.
The duplication of funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of II coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Supersiles of II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest companies in China – Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Leigh University, Melen Lee worked on an I.I. system that beat the most successful solo player in America, then was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee gives the previous technology competitions to the federal government, for example, the robotics race of the Agency for advanced defence research projects, and asks when it will be the next one to help identify the new visionaries.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get funding from the government," Leigh said.
"Not China takes away academic leaders, but corporations," the man said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on I.I.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its II programme.
"I think the doctors in the IT sciences should automatically be offered green cards," the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way in which the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, stated Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which aims to include adult and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Art Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of the II.
In the meantime, the US legislator, who wanted to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, did not observe any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is claims against its territorial integrity, thus imposing a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while campaigning for his boycotting casts a shadow as to whether the referendum would succeed in reaching the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of the bulletins reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the established post-Yugoslav country Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje, said.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have said they will comply with the result of it to the extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote on this.
The state electoral commission has announced that there have been no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoritsa and their son Dusko voted in Macedonia's referendum to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union to Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents held by boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our state may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us because over 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he released his own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result will lead to "confirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, Macedonia's Institute of Political Studies published results from a survey that says between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another survey, the work of Macedonian TV Thelma, announced that 57% of the responders plan to vote Sunday.
Of them 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguiro of Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and marks a goal
Sergio Aguiro and Rahim Sterling overcome Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday to the Etyhad Steidium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguiro naked in 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentinan golmaster was found with a belt in the middle of the field.
He outruns three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the blank space ahead.
Then Aguiro came around four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest of the border on Brighton's criminal field.
Then he passed on the left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who with his right foot struck over Brighton's doorkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions at his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned to have him play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score at this very moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance to the "heavens" in this game by the High League of England.
He called in 29 minutes.
In the naked situation, Aguiro received a deep pass at half of Brighton.
He immediately released a severance belt on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Dream advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a belt on the far beam.
The “heavens ” attacker was able to detect close by just before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a match from the Champion League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Schercer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
Once the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no special point for another game of a titled starter.
And yet always the ambitious Schercer hopes to be a titler on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the game is important to the Rockies who lead with a single match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Card after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the Division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?"
Nationals still haven't announced a starting pitcher on Sunday, but it's supposed to allow Schercer to participate if the game is decisive.
For Schercer, this would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, and he held training on Thursday and would have the normal time to rest until Sunday.
The right-hand pitcher of Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikers in 220 2/3 innings during this season.
Trump's picking up supporters in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation with his elected Supreme Court judge Brett Cavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, I am really involved, that is why I am struggling with all the forces for the right bids," Trump said.
Then he continued with "You all see this terrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you alone witness their unhappiness, their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to get involved in power and governance, because they're only interested in power and governance, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves a goal of “interpreting and obstructing. ”
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "the angry, the wicked, the wicked and the unfaithful".
The president reminded of the Senate Judicial Commission, citing Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein's name, which sparked strong noises from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad credential – perhaps the worst I've ever seen.”
The Labourists are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of parliament of the Labourists who was declared not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My college in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude, as he firmly faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship is critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the time of the previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we wish that the meetings would include all and be beneficial. ”
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labourists in parliament, the Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises of “lighter and measured” politics have long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became more and more apparent that the different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was overestimated on the basis of how much they liked the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had previously considered sharing similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never agree with – whether on the national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – there's a whole abusive tirade in the social networks where it calls for a response, a rejection of moderate policy, applications that it does not belong to the Labourists.
Like this isn't just happening to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I'm even more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are mostly political.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of those colleagues who face sexist or racist bribes every day without being afraid of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that Labourists should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide open, with any sign of mistrust or change of choice rules becoming increasingly narrower.
During the last two years, I have received many counsel to keep quiet, not to speak so much, and then “all will be well. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a student provoked by the government of Thatcher, which through neglect led to a literal collapse of my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them the most – whether as a local adviser or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state turns to Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and my energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labourists.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labours or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats to response or political extortion will refuse me to act in the way that I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led to the ranking
The two late essays may have changed the light finals, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game by Tennent's League.
The team is already heading the ranking, and only ten teams are lost by now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Merchi and his team could be very pleased.
"I am happy because the other teams tested us very seriously in the past games, but we are still without loss," Merci noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Greetings for Air really took advantage of their attitudes better than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute followed by a successful additional blow to Frasier Klimo, performed Air ahead in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes released to play in the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to catch up the result after Jason Baggott realized an essay followed by a failed additional blow.
The climate increased the advantage of Air from a criminal blow just before the halftime, marking the essay after the solo action, and then realizing the extra blow, thus making the result 17-5 for Air on the rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay followed by a successful additional blow to Bagut, reduced the lead to just five points.
After a lengthy suspension of the game due to the severe injury of Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and after the renewal of the match Air increased their advance after the essay of Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then the acting Captain of Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their number by exerting strong pressure and performing an essay through Bruce Colvin followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned their presence to the spirit, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card after bringing down the Air-free Air-Ball, from the subsequent criminal playoffs McPherson realized an essay with the help of Air's advanced offensive line.
The climate realized the extra blow, and not after long did it again after Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's kicked-out ball and took Gregor Henry's wing to the flang for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Still Game star seems to be heading towards a new career in the restaurant business.
The Still Game Ford Kiernan seemed to be heading for a direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular broadcast of the BBC, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was planning to join Glasgow's "a booming restaurant business".
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia Hopes That the Court Will Reopen the Road to the Pacific
Sailors are constantly patrolling the occupiers with a taxidermist in La Paz.
Above public buildings is an ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaka to Amazonka are adorned with the motto: “Our sea is right.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody 19th-century conflict, is still alive – and the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has been the strongest since decades, while Bolivia has been awaiting judgment by the international court on October 1st, since five years have already passed in consideration.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is clarity and unity everywhere, as the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia's sovereign access to the ocean.
Here comes Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is about to take the fight to re-election next year, also bet a lot and much on the court's judgment Monday.
"We are close to regaining access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility of the court making a decision in favour of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it were in her favor, it wouldn't change things to reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to take Chile's territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the final arguments indicates that the case is “not complex,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been blown up by the current government of Bolivia," said Zarate.
Then he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric had wiped out and the little remaining will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after normal dialogue has taken place.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions on each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
He said on Monday, Bolivia would have "the incredible opportunity to open up the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as the chance to "end 139 years of disagreements by achieving benefits for both countries".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political duck".
"The Bolivia will never give up its right to exit to the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it won't continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States of America.
Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Young Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ree delivered his speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposition countries in Singapore.
His comment came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the edge to restart the free diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ree called "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections on a declaration that would end the Korean war would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second date.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about their refusal from the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange the preparation of a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest scream on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun's rays, you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming collection of SS19, which rocked the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
A lot of impractical hats I caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, and designers sent in their eyes their creations to rock the fashion community.
Valentino's expounding proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar feathers wide periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included decorated with jewelry dunes, a magical hat and even pineapples – but they have no intention of keeping warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – and it was just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of the higher fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a complete set of snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream company.
If you're into such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come soon after the "La Bomb" – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery, which was seen on everyone's heads – from Riana to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cult to the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion podium – a strawed beach bag, as large as the wearing it with a swimsuit.
The bag of rhafia with the color of a burnt orange, with a raffia trimming with a handle of white leather, was attracting all the views of the item in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The celebrity Stylisher Luke Armid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for wholesale accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career, and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can form and implement a personal learning programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a clear language about him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are in the first place with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high A rating.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with the same rating being 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of students in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
Currently languages as subject to free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (e.g. scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) in both independent schools and beyond programmes.
In 2014 by the Commission on Employment and Job Skills of the United Kingdom, a survey showed that, for reasons of the difficulty of employers finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Thus, the increasing rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more work positions require the rule of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential to a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after ruling such a skill that remains for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling several languages of a person in front of competition.
According to a study by YouGov, more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013 did not have a good enough foreign language to carry out language, and French was the only language to achieve a two-digit percentage with a 15% indicator.
That is why investment in language learning is important for children today.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will vary from language to language.
A series of schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future of 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life regardless of what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered to be “International communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with a variety of quality and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who are going to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakes team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the team's first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it hasn't been specified how many minutes he'll play in the fight.
"He'll be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," a joker named Walton announced via Lakes' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced in Twitterer that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers' pre-seasonal preparation.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallys tonight in Wyling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rallys, which include familiar stops, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying his election to fill the seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
At what time will Trump's rally in West Virginia be held tonight and how can you watch online?
The visit to Trump in Willing, West Virginia was planned for 19 hours, Eastern time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably review this week's hearings for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh's nominations, in which there has been tension over claims of immoral sexual acts, which has kept the Senate's confirmation vote for up to a week pending an investigation by the FBI.
The main goal of this series of rallyes, however, is to help Republicans raise momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallys next week aim to "activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so essential to its programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season filled with commitments," Reuters told a spokesman at Trump's campaign that refuses to be mentioned.
Tonight's event, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wyling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
The second visit to Trump for this month in West Virginia will take place on Saturday – a state in which it won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind in the sociological research.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Bath 2018: The US team will fight until last, keeping its hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three consecutive sessions without "Fourssum" intrigue, the Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what Ryder Bath needed.
The change of advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, in which players, however, believe unconditionally, even more in a race like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led with six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we picked a little momentum," Jordan Spitt said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with just twelve more to distribute.
As Spite says, however, the Americans have more to show, and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge on the sport form of Spite and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The promotional attitudes of fans grew stronger as he progressed in a round in which with a precise blow he leveled the result in the fourth match, after along with Thomas two lashes after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the match of the 15th Hole, was met with strong uplifted reactions that make us believe that it's really not all lost to the American team.
"It is important not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spite said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spitte and Thomas in the last two days are Francesca Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed characters of Ryder Bath so far.
The strange, yet delightful couple in Europe, won four out of four, and it all seems to be working out for them.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "goddes" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or the morning.
These consistent successes, as well as the way they seemed to have passed energy between them and the enthusiastic fans, have confirmed the view that they are players who will win Sunday and there will be no better couple than Fleetwood and Molinari, who will bring Europe's potential victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time of different holes.
But the stories of European fame proved a little premature.
Bug Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the football game from the morning until he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "Dubles" on the first nine holes put the Spanish and the Swedish in problems that they failed to deal with.
But in Sunday's games, there's no way anyone else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "Fourssom" games are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips that exchange each other, and the way a strategy can change at any moment.
The Europeans played better teamly, and that is why they gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "Foursem" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last – something many people, especially in the United States, doubted strongly.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Bath.
Europe will have a strong lead before the last day of Ryder Bath, after taking the US with 10-6 after playing football and "Foursum" on Saturday.
The inspiring duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, which brought their action to the Le Golf National competition to four points.
In an attempt to win back the trophy that lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourball" match against the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and ultimately Europe won the 3-1 series.
The United States has shown more resistance in the "Foursom" match, where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points of the 12 singles on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is Europe's first rookie, won four in a row, and he and Molinari, known as Molywood, became only the second couple after this sensation weekend, won four points from their first four games in Ryder's Cup history.
Once Woods and Patrick Reed unappellatedly outplayed the football games, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and US rookie Bryson Decambo with an even more unequivocal score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, once in a while demonstrated a burst of his genius, but so far, there have been 19 losses of 29 matches in "Fourball" and "Foursum" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning football matches, is partnering with Henrik Stanson in the "Foursome" clashes during the 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka, respectively, number one and number three in the world.
However, Europe's team has failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day south of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "Fourball" matches, and later they returned to defeat Polter and Rory Macilroy with 4&3 in the "Foursum" match, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Bath's history, a team has been able to make up four points of deficit before singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team will keep the trophy even in equality.
However, having been outplayed in two consecutive days, their chances of a turn Sunday seem to be not particularly high.
North Korea says there is no way to disarm one side, without confidence
The foreign minister of North Korea announced to the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened mistrust with the United States and there is no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation Ri Young-hoe, he said that during the last year, "significant measures of goodwill" have been taken, for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We still don't see a corresponding US reaction," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances is there any way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ree voiced the known complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "sedition" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, as it took step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement from Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump gave guarantees for security to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists "to remove nuclear weapons first" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war," Rhi said.
"The notion that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
However, the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed earlier this week in the UN.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the country was South Korea on the issue of nuclear disarmament and not the United States, the removal of the Korean Peninsula's nuclear weapons would not have reached such a stalemate.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he told the UN general meeting that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim a suicide missile.
This year at the UN Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "complete destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said much work was still to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea eliminates nuclear weapons.
Trump stressed on Wednesday that he did not have a deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the UN Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of the nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ree at the towers at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last journey went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, but only after a few hours of North Korea accused him of having made "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that “the same measures ” he sought were the guarantees of security that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a sufficient rest course
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night” with caffeine.
A teacher found that university students number one in the world often don't even think about themselves when it comes to taking care of themselves.
Charles Kaisler, professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the women's hospital, prepared the course he thinks is the first of his generation in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"A girl finally came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said no one has ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The first time this year, the course explains to students the most about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve the overall well-being.
Paul Barajra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to take the course after students found themselves suffering from a serious lack of sleep this week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of sleeping.
Another part of the participants tells how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on health from choice to smoke), added Prof. Kaiser.
The culture of pride from "teaching all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling out, as depriving the brain into the hunger mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaiser prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year in Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete such a study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaisler recommends that students consider setting the alarm for bed and waking up and knowing the harmful effects of “the blue light, ” broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circus rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kick broke Stephen Gerard's impeccable team and won a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory as a triumph guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only committed the second defeat of Gerard in his 18 games as manager, which left his team with eight points less than Harts' torn off team, a leader in the Ladbrokes League.
Menga marked seven minutes before the break, and the deprived of the constructive ideas of Rangers' team at no time seemed close to equalization.
After the Rangers got to sixth place and Livingston was third, leaving the second Hibernian only naked.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit by an object that was obviously thrown by the fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that broke Air in the Scotland League semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same one-seater of Livingston who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team paired all actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the rule of the ball, but Livingston did better in rarer cases when they owned it.
They had to mark back at the second minute when Menga took out a touch by Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan MacGregor, but the half-protector missed the good opportunity.
Later, the center of Keegan Jacobs from the foul found Captain Craig Halquett, but his partner in defense of Alan Litgow took the ball away from the rear beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a duel in the 15th minute when he met Stephen Lawles, but the referendum, Stephen Thompson, rejected the Colombian claim.
Rangers only took two exact hits in the first half, but the former goalkeeper from Ibrox Liam Kelly dealt easily with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak shot of these Ejaria.
Although Livy's hit at 34 minutes was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was completely deserved.
Rangers again failed to cope with the deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave Menga in cold blood for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the holiday by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to a result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play in a comfortable home style game, such as Litgou and Halket constantly repel the sent forward long balls.
Holt's team could've increased its lead in the last few minutes, but MacGregor managed to handle Jacobs' blow, and with the subsequent corner boy Litgou shot his head down the beam.
The insider like Glenn Middleton's reserve from the Rangers asked for a deposit at the end of the fight after a match with Jacobs, but Thompson never saw anything wrong again in the situation.
Yearbook: Geiger counter inventor
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day in which future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method of detecting and measuring the radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
From then on, the Geiger counter turned into a cornerstone of pop culture when the film "Koronado's Stones" came out in 1950, which appeared to be the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What the hell is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms removed from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's shooting right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.

The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and is injected again in the patient
The vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine who is training the immune system to recognize foreign cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to a number of cancers called HER2, and then inject themselves again in the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers” including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to the administration of immune cells from patients and their ‘training’ how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription “Let’s Make America Great Again” in its participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was played in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a meaningless performance in which US President Donald Trump praised and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again", he announced against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“ I often talk with white people, and they ask me, ‘ How can you like Trump, he’s a racist? ’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Law Committee on sexual violence complaints made by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was unexpressed, the West performance record was uploaded to the social networks by the Comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was tormed behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I'm being harassed!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship?” saying that you will wear Superman’s costume because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
The comments caused at least twice the audience's whistles and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, said Variety, saying, "The whole studio has shut up."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper MacMiller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle "Perier".
West received the support of the leader of TPUSA conservative group, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR FINISHING THE TOWN. ”
However, leading the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply “was itself and this is wonderful.”
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (when I buy the music or his clothing or support his "art") for whom I think he welcomes and spreads an ideology that is worthy of society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, "now he is officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daedi, Puffie and Py Didi.
His friend, the Snoop Dog rapper's name was Snoop Lyon, and the Prince music legend changed his name with a symbol.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the D.A.'s office.
The star of "Game a throne" Kit Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is famous for the role of the waving sword John Snow in the full of violent medieval fancy NGO series "Igran on the thrones".
But the actor, 31, has declared himself against the stereotype of macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be “crupulous ” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her partner from "Play of the thrones" Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits that she feels "hard convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
"At the moment I am personally convinced – what have we done wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many masculine figures.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What's taught by television and the street that makes guys feel like they need to become this particular type of guy?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's confused for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not take part in the pretexts or extensions of "Play of the thrones" after the end of the show next summer, claiming that he had "done off with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play a role in the restoration of Sam Shepherd's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in "Play of thrones".
"I met my wife in this series, so that's how he gave me my future family and set my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the girl where Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with the fantasy show, the winner of the Amy Prize.
They married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to the health services in the country, more than 820 000 people have been affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were around 40,000 new cases reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Human HIV is rapidly distributed in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV thus has been reduced to almost zero, the health services of China said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, each year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
Handing over HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against the people of the KGB community is widespread.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have had sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
Many cases of disease transmission are caused by improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of senators from the Republican party, swears "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US House of Representatives Maxine Waters sentenced the charges that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from Republicans on the pages of the legislation in Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrats said the claims were made by experts and sites of the "ultra right wing".
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of state senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing of the Senate's composition on charges of immoral sexual conduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau.
The runoff was carried out after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Preservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications is linked to Waters' office, and has released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded statement is completely false and is an absolute lie," continued Waters.
‘The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these deceitful and false claims, is in no way responsible for the leak of that information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House secretary Ari Fletcher.
"There is anger in this denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it does not have a temper suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fletcher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' place in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Currently, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had met the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these deceitful claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed, ” she continued, “and that they will be under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team. ”
Johnny English Revues Again – The Weak Spy Parady With Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the rebirth of Action-Committee, a spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Will the self-smile and the mimes that say how obvious it is that we are stupid turn into a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes all round and his “tire” face has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to great comic creation, designed for fans of the cinema, who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who despite his strange claims of flattery has little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean and much of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on the leftover chaos behind by a traveler and an international man, whom Atkinson plays in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads.
In the last Johnnie English movie, there's, like, two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a while the fins dipped in his helmet.
The contribution of Atkinson to the physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely unnecessary, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "The Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems rather directed towards the children, not to the elderly, but to the crazy accidents of Johnny English, in my opinion, are not innovative and focused, as there is no Actinson game to remind Mr. Bean.
The always current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked into the British super-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operative agents for the horror of the duty officer -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Teresa-Mei role, but there is nothing to work with in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisors are informing her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a schoolteacher in a chicos center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons about being an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English re-creates a spy rock academy.
English was summoned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and is reunited with his former longtime assistant, Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man married to a submarine commander, a cheerful role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ofelia Buletova played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their odysseys from farces: dressed as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Walta; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the house of Volta.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since it's so cute and lush, there's a lot more content here for children.
It's a pretty mediocre production.
Just like other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Labourists deny that they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work four weeks a week, but to get paid for five.
The party claims it wants company bosses to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "save" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that before the end of the year, policy review will be reported.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that is entered in the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as in the party's common industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this pursuit does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
Labers spoke: “The four-day working week is not in party politics. ”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "impersonal directors" and "pulsants" in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour Government could impose "resistances" on the basis of the infringements found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers into company boards and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital to private companies of employees who can raise annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak 60 minutes ago whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh slowed his final vote on the Supreme Court's nomination for at least a week and raises the question whether the findings of the Bureau could make some of the Republican party senators withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent, Scott Peley, asked the senators from the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open compared to his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was decisive, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's voice seemed uncompromising, however.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavanaugh and in order to change that, a shakedown charge is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it firmly," Graham added, addressing Christine Blassius Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: the elimination of poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great sea in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but will also meet the real goal of the event – the removal of the extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively struggling with it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "acts" as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, telephone calls or connection in any other way in order to help raise awareness of their poverty target.
But how successful is Global Citizens 12 years before achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to demand action or is it just another case of so-called "cliktivism" – people think they do something important when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, already paying or collecting at least 10 billion dollars.
The group believes that the funds already provided had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "Foodpower", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, committed to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note," said the Ambassador to the "Trace Ulman Food Force" in front of the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken, which call on Britain to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, "The Power of Diet", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But just like in the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi-Bi, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's event in New York, leading to Deborah-Lie Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use naval forces to “block” and hinder energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy entering markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the event, organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which presents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace fuels," he said, while at the same time determining Russia as a "poony with a single number", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump administration is tasked with strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has turned Berlin into "a hostage".
Moscow has stressed several times that the 11 billion-dollar pipeline of North Stream 2 that will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be an instrument for the pressure exercise and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "take a serious look" at the presidential bid after the interim elections.
During the city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for Washington to enter women and correct our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the presidential bid."
Warren voiced his opinion regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "takes this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was honest in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh.
A Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological survey conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters did not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this bid.
The sociological survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's bid, with 38 per cent for and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed in terms of potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sara Palin pointed out the PTSD to Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his entry in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds the soldiers are coming back with," she told the audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, hardened, returned and wondered if they would receive this respect that they themselves and their brothers had given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unsecured state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila's police administration.
18 States and Colombia County support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia County support the judicial challenge of a new US policy, which refuses asylum against victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the district applied for goodwill in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against federal politics in August, was not revealed.
She claims that her partner, “and sons of the cruel members of his gang, ” has harassed her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. attorneys helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which bring a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations facing comprehensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned the decision to the 2014 Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian attorney Carl Rasin says in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates that principle," the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that a policy that refuses the entry of immigrants is harmful to the US economy, arguing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary working hand".
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to suspend the provision of asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gangster violence.
"The shelter is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political convictions," Sessions said in his July 11th communication on politics.
The refuge was never meant to ease all problems – not even all serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save in Palu while deaths double during search for survivors
The situation of survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick little boy at an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is defiled."
The inhabitants have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save some of their flooded items.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake with a magnet of 7.5 are overrun.
Some of the victims, including Dvi Harris, who suffered a fracture on the spine and shoulder, were placed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open due to continuing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the severe earthquake in the fifth-floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the destroyed wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with the family to attend the wedding.
"I kept my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China in "Treats" with "Papaganda"
One week after the official newspaper in China launched a four-page advertisement in an American daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press of spreading propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the November 6th US Congress election.
Trump's indictment that Peki was trying to interfere with the US Congress's election, noted what US officials had told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercial promotional ads, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war, equating import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in the States, as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-time Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in comment in Des Moines Register’s weekly issue, “is currently doubling this harassment by putting propaganda ads into our own free press. ”
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China took advantage of the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and the press by running a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on the troubled economic trajectory of China, considering that the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh's campaign, Republicans repel women's voters for mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the Supreme Court nominations for Bret Kavano on several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a response, in particular from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the plate are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Rahrer, a professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, said on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters scandalled "Noemvri is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue the nomination of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasiy Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; this is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters of women in suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's nominations, analysts suggest that a responsibilities may follow if the republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the stand. It is about the way Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," Gay Cecile, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on the issue of who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little bit more clone to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the responders definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that they believe Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her in an insecure condition when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals before her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Team Burners-Lee is starting a bid that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of the legend in technology, Inrut, is a company that builds the platform with an open source of Berners-Lie Solid.
Solid allows consumers to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, the intention behind Inrut is "worldly dominance".
"We need to do it now," he said regarding the undertaking.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online personal data storage facility” or pod.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available through each browser, and at the same time there are all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "a given authority for personal data."
The idea for Inrut, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to invest the company resources, processes and adequate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a contract for work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralisation applications using the tools available on the Inrut website.
Burners-Li said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated in one night.
"We do not want permission from them."
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that the mission of Inrut was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Li transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Li has had a strong influence on the debate about net neutrality.
Although Inrut started, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Li added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest honored by the cross of Victoria during World War I
They have been recorded for 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest, honored by the cross of Victoria for his participation in wartime activities during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918, at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing he was honored with Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial was opened on Saturday by both his grandchildren on a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" to have the monument discovered exactly 100 years of his grandfather's case, awarded with a medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy shooting from artillery and machine guns."
Later he attacked the fire line and with “incredible courage ” led the building forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me feel humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to see the complete edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally witness the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audiences in Britain remained amazed when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up to the early hours, especially because of the fight.
The fan described on Twitter the switching of the children's animation movie as "a kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 am this content is not appropriate, so the programme was replaced by a children's transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa Pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they would work on planning meetings to include audiences from Britain in the future.
"In my view, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six in the morning on Sunday, and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there – on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received many messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six – as we usually do – we've tried to provide more to the fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent host of the long-standing show, Kursty Young, is in hospital for several months.
When participating in Lavern Daley's first program, he said he felt less and less than everyone else as he grew up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of underprivilegedness and being different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it was "something", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's Games of the British Community in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire the hope of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, he was "surprised."
Daley made a marriage with Oscar's bearer, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young” – he first participated in the Olympic Games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley herself said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I only care about winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named Robert's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said that his father could not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you wouldn't be there for me, Dad, or in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamt about it my whole life - jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no more great feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – who accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him tense.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British Summer Time.
The lost form of Michelson stays at the Ryder Bath stand on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th race at Ryder Bath, but he'll have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record tied to failure.
Mikkelson, who participated in the event for the record 12th time in two years, was left at the stand by Captain Jim Furik for "Fourball" and "Foursum" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete who, even at the top of his career, was never among the most legitimate players, is not in optimal shape for the hard field of Le Golf National, where the long rough terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the court itself isn't disturbing enough, in Sunday's ninth game, Michaelson will face the exact champion of the British Open French Molinari, who is on the team with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points before the 12 singles make a strong start, it could be that the Michaelson game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, he knocked me back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident of himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much in both the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how it works, and we believe we've made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the biggest race in Ryder Bath played on Sunday.
This may end his career in Ryder Bath, which has never drawn close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits for the team that are not measured by figures.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be melted
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage gained before the singles of the last day of Ryder Bath can easily be deleted.
The Dutchman debuted in the Wilderrama match in 1997, when the team with Captain Svee Ballisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but right on the final line was almost reached and managed to withstand the victory of 14th and 13th.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead on the Walderrama; we had a big lead on the Brookline, where we lost, and on the Walderrama we won, but very hard," Bjorn said after the 2018 Europe team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with which you led with 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Stand by for attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's done until you see the final result of the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I kept saying that I think only of the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied by the performance of players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you go out alone, then you test out all your capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to get to the players: tomorrow you have to do your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner as he must also be given to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of rival Jim Furik will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these big reverses on the last day – he was part of the "Brookline" triumph, and then he was on the losing side when Europeans performed "The Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain of 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at Brookline, as well as Medinah.
When the advantage moves from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under enormous tension.
That's why we've formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try to make the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McCilroy in the most important game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I chose these players in this row because I think that gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said of his choice for singles.
Germany rescinds the launch of a new battleship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the aged warships of the Cold War, but this would not take place until at least next year because of the malfunctioning systems and largely growing costs local media reported.
The introduction into operation of Reheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The vessel had to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aged frigates of Bremen class.
Understandably, they will have a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stelt technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates must be able to be used up to two years before returning to the ports of housing.
However, uninterrupted delays mean that the avant-garde military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when entering operation, notes Die Zeit.
The evil frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of essential "soft and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, reducing its effectiveness and limiting the possibility of the naval forces to add future superstructures.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of such class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also becoming a problem.
It is believed to have reached the staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "exhausts from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become greater in time since the old ships were taken out of operation but no new ones were granted.
He complained that no frigate from the Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to identify how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats as well as brown arrow water nightshades at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will identify the frequency of bat sounds and which species issue them.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Duir, a natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other species associated with them.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain in general decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by the construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of habitats.
The risk for populations can be caused by wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echo-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The trust has trained experts carrying out regular studies, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threeave estate in the region of Dumfreys and Gallaway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson mansion says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a great field for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many grown trees and completed a suitable habitat.
But there's still a lot more about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better than what they need to thrive."
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before property maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible for the inadvertent destruction of a asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
The blind are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their refuges.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Bat Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, because we just don’t know what’s happening to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, and his lawyers will sue a German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo set the allegations of rape against him as "failing news", saying that people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German press magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
Portugal and Juventus were charged with raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that then he paid her $375 000 to shut the incident down, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, several hours after the publication of the claims, Ronaldo, 33, sworn the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the five-time gold ball bear said in front of the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to build popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claims they call “an inadmissible publication of suspects in the field of personal life, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would demand compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the burden of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football room, where it is said that he raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County district court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the Ronaldo incident he fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" at "99%", but in the case he simply failed to "one percent".
According to the files, Ronaldo confirmed they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "scarred by revenge" and was worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the injury of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the amount of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain “will regret forever” that it lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnstone plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
Japan's car manufacturer said the impact of the border delay in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to a loss of jobs.
In the Burnstone factory – where the Auris and Avensis models were produced last year – nearly 150 000 cars were produced, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, the director of Toyota in Burnstone.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they're closing down their mini-model plant in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line is working on the timing principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both from the UK and from the EU for cars manufactured on request.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which, according to industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's "chart" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have a deal. We want to close the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to grab this opportunity," he said in the program 4's Today's BBC Radio.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term warns that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the founder of the Union Unite at the plant, said that his members are becoming more and more concerned: “From their experience, I think that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says.
An extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "spended by another week", as the candidate's fight for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy prosecutor, or not, and thus endangers Muller's independence, has been feeding the rumours about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he was resigning.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer that he would not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate legal committee, which was testified against both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment - Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may not be the date yet, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I believe it may well be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The lecturer, Chris Wallace, asked for the reason.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not about the "demonstrate behaviour" of television journalists, although he said: "I cannot say that I do not agree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more sessions with questions and answers from every president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, continued Sanders, but "if the press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've been witnesses to practice it quite often over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with visiting seniors.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentrical and moments of strange behavior to fellow journalists.
Health Minister Turns to EU Workers in Scotland's National Health Service with regard to Brexit's Fears
The Minister of Health turned in writing to EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and their desire to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left until Britain's EU exit.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving, decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also advancing in its preparations for a possible non-negotiable scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
I would therefore like to recall how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers' Linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation after receiving head trauma during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodore 31-27, according to Mike Authority of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, shared with reporters that the trauma occurred just before the half.
"He went to the side line and kind of just passed out there," Reid said.
Trainers and medics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before it was placed on the stretcher and taken to the lockers for further examination.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet of the type/serious nature of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a secondary student with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher arms account when purchasing real estate in Britain
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher arms account when purchasing real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the arms commission will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The State Treasury expects an increase of more than 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher arms account in the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the arms account will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues supporting the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is an addition to the current arms account, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for the purpose of award – can amount to up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the newly built buildings in London are bought by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people buying property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "treasure cities", due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the arms account to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing to correct the UK's "warning of dwellings".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control of rentals and the end of the guilt-free exiles.
He also wishes to give the advice greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “I shared last year that I would like to dedicate my time as a prime minister to restore the British dream, that every new generation’s life would be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy both easy housing and hardworking citizens of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the insult from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scots team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said the "greatest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge of bringing the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third position in the First League, to three points in the first place.
He moved on to Steidium of Light this summer after last season he performed St. Miren back to the Scottish Supreme League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up with the games of Scotland on the Hamptons, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
"This possibility, however, would only open if I had success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers are names such as Dick Advocaat, David Moise, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Kanio.
A former Aloa Atletik's teacher said he did not feel anxious as an heir to such established names in such a famous club, and before that he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"To me, success will be measured with a positive answer to the question, "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because on a structure, basis and conditions it is undoubtedly at the level of the Supreme League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miren from a falling team to a winner in Championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was really at the crossroad," he remembers the time he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including before being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I've really done it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my whole conscious life."
You can hear the whole interview on Sportsground on Sunday, September 30, at the radio Scotland frequency between 12:00 and 13:00 British summer time
The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals a study
Summer heat has increased the income of British pub survivors, but has gained more tension for chain restaurants.
The pub and bar groups reported an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues in the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultant, who compiled statistics, said: “Because of the long-term solar time and continued longer than England’s expected participation in the World Championship, in July, a similar model was followed as in June, when pubs reported growth by 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline by 1.8% in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their height, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The pubs with food also suffered from solar weather, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, drinking sales jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while food down by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM rest and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue to continue the trend that we noticed in late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although a fall in sales with 4.8 per cent per year may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food managers and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in pub sales and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in branding.
Coffer Peach Tracker, sales analyst in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 billion British pounds, and is a confirmed indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides from their parents a secret profile in a social network
One in five children — some barely 11 — has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Insta pages
News has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main ” profile that showed their parents
One in five children – some of 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps secret from adults.
A study among 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta accounts – reference to Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main ” profile that showed their parents, while having secret profiles.
A mother who came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape him. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of Independent Schools held that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Ailide Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in Scotland's Light Athletics Board
Ailide Doyle was elected to join the Ship of Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
He has made Scotland's leprosy with the most achievements and President Ian Beaty has specified this move as a great opportunity for those leading to the sport to take advantage of its rich experience at international level over the last decade.
"Ailide enjoys a great deal of respect in Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction," Byty said.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the 200-400-metre finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I got hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell me if I would recover to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I've achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again, and I'm doing mobility training today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, split online opinions
A company that produces breast-feeding pumps has divided online opinions by advertising, comparing breast-feeding mothers with breast-feeding cows.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected “first noiseless pump for breastfeeding in the world, suitable for wearing”, Elvie, a consumer technology company launched a humorous musical-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the infants to appear.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's barn full of hay, on the background of a song with a text, including, "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a vime, it's my breasts."
The song continues: “Brow, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, suck, suck your friends. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many said it was downplaying the milk processing industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie breast-feeding pump is collected discreetly in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "So inadequate advertising."
Others protected the ad, and a woman admitted that she considered the song to be “extremely fun. ”
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The draining made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," wrote someone.
Another comment: “It’s a funny commercial directed at mothers who get squeezed (often in their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like “cows. ”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the processing industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered they were dancing with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many nursing women feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and gathers discreetly in breast-feeding bras, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out until they're drained.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is so revolutionary that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between breast milk cows and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on lactating the breast milk and all the challenges related to it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
That's not the first time Elvie's pump is in the lead news.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were moved secretly to a palace camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, in part because the acute rhetoric and politics of Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are immigrants without documents that fear they may risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults from the family must provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
‘Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or are members of the family of the guardians residing illegally in the country, most of whom are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In their quest to cope faster with the registration of these children, authorities imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to staff at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case of legal status to an immigration judge.
Those identified as inappropriate for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent escape or attempted escape, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern grew in large facilities, such as in Thornillo, where the signs of a child having problems are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the site.
They added that moving the children to a “palatkov city ” without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends may make it difficult for many to deal with.
Syria Urges US, France, Turkey's "occupancy troops" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has continued for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops reside illegally on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism and "to which they will take appropriate action".
"They should be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands have been cleansed" by both terrorist organisations and "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian soldiers, who are mainly training and counseling both Kurdish and Syrian parts, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands devastated by the war.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions were bearable and could return by accusing “some Western countries of“ stretching out unruly fears ” that move refugees to stay away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to cooperate for these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political question something that is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be granted to the restoration of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war is reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major fortress of rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military actions would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda front which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy, Stefan de Mystura, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draw up a draft of Syria's postwar constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem laid out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "a review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
By this logic Trump will win the election re-election in 2020 unless – as many liberal viewers probably hope – his presidency is not terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
That would no doubt be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
At this point, there's no sign of the viewers' fatigue.
Since 2014 the premium rating has increased double to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the premium, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, which is being told about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack against the Capitol.
Nell Skwell, who is a veteran screenwriter of comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her cab driver said she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why? ”
Mrs. Skwell told me that he replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
There's fun in the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else shown on television, exiting Washington stories can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can be reunited, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to this at six o'clock to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket from the screech skin for $15,000 (“an outfit full of arrogance” according to the “Washington Post”), and the shocking descriptions of Storm Daniels on Mr Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"The part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Paw Stars, as regards changing participants and everyday turns (eating with the National Football League, praising Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleece this week, he had a suntan on the north bank of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to separate himself from the television, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal committee and depended on the Supreme Court's future.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flake told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments flow into the most disputed race in Congress's early elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the redeployment of the districts of Congress and from there two titlers for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative democracy Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb is facing another holder, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th Pennsylvania County, which stands up significantly for the new 17th.
The cards were rediscovered after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb made it to Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the wide-ranging partial elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador because of its support for China, then withdrawing
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted to Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call on the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions no longer recognise Taiwan," Heather Naurt, a spokesman of the Department, said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid for the fight against drugs, for the purpose of development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cutting off financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be excruciating for the Central American state with its unemployment and the rate of killings.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served for the duration of such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities indicated that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively terminating any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens announced that he will participate in a conference planned for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives to the gathering, diplomats say.
The three US MPs returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next move may be the report by Special Councillor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, with the report currently showing significant evidence in the public register.
It is said that Mr. Muller directs his investigation into whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign during their attack against our elections.
If Congress's leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to take into account this body, just when he's about to face the voters, as well as perhaps the jury composed of his colleagues.
There is a lot of unknown here, and I don't imagine that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - and that's not the case for him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, until the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The pace of history depends on such a wave of moments, and the inexplicable march of democracy is fasting or slowing down.
Right now, Americans are facing some of these knots.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper announced that last year he proposed to secretly sign off on the president and speculated with the opinion that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the Times story was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual harassment and perjury?
And, above all, will we vote in the early election to Congress if this will force Mr Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy waits for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I took a lesson from Prague.
My mother was Jewish from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Brukings Institute, is the chair of “Citizens of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington” and is the author of “The Last Palace: Europe’s Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.”
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the run-in with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, awareing that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from Group D to the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow the semi-protector Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 equality in question with Villareal, but he believed that for Rangers this result could turn into a tramplin to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old football player.
"We entered the match with hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Perhaps we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night of our European games.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that's happened around my contusions and club changes, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team's good, and the guys are really having fun, training's good.
I hope we can harness all our strengths so we can forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they wanted to receive, few people are discussing this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study share that they discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them talked to their kids about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but did not take steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nation's life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Along with your adviser and your family discuss where and how you want to be taken care of, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when choosing a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your resources – if you have the money resources.
Create your legal papers: Deal with the legal battles from the beginning.
Appointing a health care officer so that you have a specific trustee who monitors your medical care and ensures that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are ineffective.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing to be ready.
"It is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the medicines like?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was coming home tonight.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfrakomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m. British summer time, as “a random act. ”
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are trying to get witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian town of Palo on Friday, authorities announced that the number of dead is expected to rise.
Due to broken communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnetus of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongal, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulavesi province, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis hit it.
It's dongala's regency, which extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of Sulavesi Island.
The regency, which an administrative region smaller than the province, is of an approximate population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulavesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel gains are also relevant for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been overrun several times since the tsunami in the last 100 years, according to reports from the Indonesian Agency for Recovery after the disaster.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami hit the western part of the Dongal, and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Tichoocean Fire Ring" and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and wave tsunamis in recent years:
2020 A strong earthquake on December 26th on the west coast of Indonesia's Acech Province in North Sumatra activates a wave of tsunamis that has hit 14 countries and has killed 226 000 people across the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: Truss with magnetwood 6.8 cut down the most inhabited island in Indonesia, Java, by activating a tsunami that broke down on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake with Magnitude 7.6 strikes near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 has slaughtered one of the islands of Mentawai and activated a 10-metre wave of tsunamis that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Regent of Paddy Jaya in Acech, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastations of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
No tsunamis are activated this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have slaughtered the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people have died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of tourists temporarily in a dead end.
Sarah Paylin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Paylin, the largest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29, by Vasila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference with domestic violence and resistance in arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a known female woman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Paylin was detained at the Mat-Su Pre-restraint Building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “innocent, certainly ” when asked to plead, the media reported.
Paylin is threatened by the punishment of three Class A prostitutes, which means he can be deprived of freedom for up to a year and pay a fine of $20,000.
He's also charged with a class B whore who's being punished with one day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Paylin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Veterans' Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of an intoxicating substance in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Paylin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died from an earthquake that killed the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The Earth of Magnitude 7.5 has caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut off, expecting the dead to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulaves, in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
There are videos on the social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York City.
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Cyfulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist assassination in New York that killed eight people – a rare fine that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is said that Saipov, 30 years old, used a Home Depot rental truck to commit the assassination in October of the Veloalei near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily damage, according to a notice of intent in connection with the death penalty claim filed in the southern region of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may end in a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an extended federal judiciary headed towards Saipov's 22-point indictment, including eight counts of racket-related murder, used normally by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of the MPS.
The attack required "serious planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "a terrible, cruel and perverse".
"Sifulo Habibulaevich causes injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lauri Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Feluchi and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last Southern area of New York has been looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time in New York a death sentence in a federal case was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy sentence and a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to the court papers.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked the hospital room to place the IDIL flag, the police said.
He pleads not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of taking a guilty and life sentence without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all those affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team before asked the D.A. not to want a death sentence.
A member of parliament of the conservatives says that NJEL Faraž must lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to "mobilise the army of the people" today, during a protest at the conservatory conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain would have "exited by now" if Mr. Farage had been secretary of the services for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in order to deal with the party's deep-separated ranks was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan, "Chequers", despite attacks by the supporters of Brexit, who also support the EU.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon told protesters with the slogan "Exit means Out" in Solihal that he is wanted "to throw away the Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr. Farage had to participate, of course, with the others and that he had to receive responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the "Chequers" plan.
Saying his opposition attitude to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be tough.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
The representative of the conservatives Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, sharing with reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped to be elected.
Please drop "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are to amend the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about trusts between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to change Brexit and we are gathered here today to say, "We will not let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class on the verge of changing Brexit feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the army of this country's people, who helped us win with Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-controllable, proud UK."
At the same time, the supporters of the staying went on a hike through Birmingham before spending a two-hour rally downtown.
A handful of activists have raised flags with the inscriptions "Conservators Against Brexit" since the start of the group this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when it opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, and more, for the smooth transition of borders to free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he will "think seriously" his bid for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that he will "seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican state representative Jeff Dale, who was co-chaired by Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the centre of speculation that it can take Trump's post in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall building after Trump was in office.
One of the audience asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied: “It is high time for women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top. ”
He was arrested for the death of Simms from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested in the shooting on Friday when basketball player Wade Simms was killed by LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 p.m. Eastern.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who was seen in the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near South University early Friday morning.
"Waid Simms has been shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," Murphy J. Paul Police Chief told the press Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, had a weapon, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without a doubt and detained in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Youth with a height of 6′6′′, grown up in Baton Rouge – Sims took part in 32 matches with 10 last season's titlers and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 match fights.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped defeat Sebastian Fetel
Since the moment Walter Botas was ranked earlier than Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously harassed Hamilton while protecting his position in the first two corners, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made the pie-stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and went out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a bold maneuver and driving “tire to the tire” which forced Ferrari’s pilot with a reluctance to release the inner part of the track to avoid the punishment by adding time after he had already closed the path of his opponent with a dangerous double protective maneuver on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday Max Verstopen started from the back lines of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
Then he even led through a rather long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimmy Rajkonen to the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit stop on the 44th tour, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Rajkonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Waltery did a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me outsmart him.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for claiming that she had not spread the letter from Christine Blazy Ford, who accused the pretender of Brett Kavano's Supreme Court in sexual harassment.
During the interview of the rallyes in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are “wrong and disgusting and dishonest.”
"What can happen and the good that happens in the Senate the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and spread, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't spreading."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't distributed," he added, impersonating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh as early as July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that this spread had happened by her office.
"I did not cover Ford's claims, I did not spread her story," Feinstein told the commission, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep my confidentiality, and I kept her confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continued to defend the pretender for the Supreme Court, accused of sex crimes against three women, the president stressed that Democrats are using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
Look at the defiance, shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the president said according to Mediate.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Douyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundy.
Dundy Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a five-to-one rematch in Dundy on Saturday.
Giants took off early in a two-gauge game after Patrick Douyer and Francis Bowier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney evened up for the hosts before Dwyer restored the front of the Giants.
Francois Bushar leveled out for Dundi before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen were to establish their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for the boys of Adam Keef who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast with 2-1 Friday nights.
It was the fourth collision among the opponents this season, as Giants won the previous three games.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting the Bowier four minutes later.
It was a tense beginning, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to level up with Cauni at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, marking the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar re-equated the chances with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corkoran united efforts to help Nilsen give a lead to Dundy for the first time this match at the end of the second half, he gave his all and strengthened the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but last half.
Giants, who lost the last four games of a total of five meetings, welcome as the hosts of Milton Keens for their next match on Friday.
Flight manager died to make sure that hundreds of people on board the plane could escape an earthquake.
A pilot of flights to Indonesia is praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers aboard managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
Strong secondary earthquakes continued to defeat the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a very shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided it was coming down.
He died at the hospital later.
The air control spokesman, Indonesia, Johannes Syrate, said that this solution may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six metres devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There are marauders everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the Red Cross International Movement in Indonesia, pointed out before CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was killed by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini has now reported that a man is unknown after a plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which launched a plane crash in a lagoon in the Pacific, now reports that one person has been reported missing since earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passport.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passport, e.g. age and nationality.
Local people's boats helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital Saturday, all in stable condition.
The causes of the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane has gone very low.
"This is extremely nice," Janes says.
Janes tells me he and the others were able to run over the deep water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardesses had panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a slight head trauma.
U.S. naval forces say sailors repairing a nearby port have also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sinks into the deep 30 meters of water (100 feet).
The data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people died during the last two decades on aircraft flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any case.
Analyst exhibits the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended its exhibition on the case this Saturday in the retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette of the U.S. Justice Department has witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers' victim the night she died.
Roulette said he had received data on the location of several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, back to his previous claims, said The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford faced the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he erased text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He has deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expects the trial to be brought before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to cause negative opinions about the genre by fulfilling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that the hip-hop has strayed from its origins of political statements and commitment to social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists of the type The Fugees and Common are being fanned in Britain by performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York City's nanny sues a couple after firing for a "rastic" message
A New York City nanny sues a couple for getting fired for discrimination after receiving a wrong message from the mother who complains she's "another black woman".
The couple refuses to be racist by dedicating their claim to "extortion".
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was devastated when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Neeeeeeeeee, next black man," wrote in a text message by Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman felt that she had fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the former African-American nanny had not done her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a business day after which she was sent home by taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation due to the dismissal, asking for $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, see, you don't have to do this," she told Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris's employment was a reasonable action because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Imagine."
Like a "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife had been born only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You're going to attack someone in this state?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born soon after the book was accepted by the audience, tells of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's a lot of fun, now that we're aware of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before he inspired himself to write the book for a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about possibly rejecting the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book “with mixed feelings” after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-proud," she said.
"But since you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child that has achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your doing.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the merits of Padington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled for nothing to save her life.
"Nah kept ringing to say that the situation is really bad that she does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"After that, Nad called me to say he's gonna die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly cease to work and leave her system.
She left a while before that, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get tight."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who has so far grieved for her daughter's loss, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I was bowing my head, and all the time my tears were dropping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of compassion with Over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women put up cards to prevent suicides from bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him after the smile.
They always said his smile brightens every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving and found himself in “a place of darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have any consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards “to let people know that she has someone to go to and talk to, even if this is a friend.
Do not keep your mouth shut. You must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her life companion of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he neither looked at them nor anything.”
She said that this was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “This opens up a void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must move forward and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI starts investigating
I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wants – a limited-term investigation and a limited-range investigation – maybe we could bring together our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "disintegrated" despite the established compartmental blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their wish is due to the moment itself.
The early elections are only five weeks later, on 6 November – if, as expected, Republicans are not well represented, their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the country will seriously be affected.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 Democrats are currently members.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his bid for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives "reduces" in Kim
South Korean legislation argues that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean United Ministry, said there were 1127 fugitives last year, compared to 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human traffickers, are key factors.
There is no official comment by Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and pass easier than a strictly guarded demilitarised area (MZ), which separates both Koreas.
China considers fugitives illegal migrants, not refugees, often coercively repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the standstill in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed in general they work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused the US of failing to make progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "an hysterical" and said he was not suitable for the Supreme Court service.
The minority leader in Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "insterity" and said he was too unbalanced for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted that way, she would have been called "an hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected claims that he committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt at the time when he was discussing his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling his claims "gross and co-ordinated attack against the personality", organised by liberals, who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that she found Cavanaugh's testimony proving that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced by the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when they asked if he would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say it that way – if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is unfit not only to enter the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that in her capacity as a democratic, she is concerned about the potential rulings of Cavanaugh regarding the Law on Available Health Care or the Roo vs. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for an hysterical, preconceived man to enter the court and expect us to say, "isn't it great?" Pelosi finished.
And women have to master each other.
It's a valid criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"I cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think he's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I got huge help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who shared that, and she cried when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her neighbor, ‘You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm pissed."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought that was genius."
Tears are allowed in expression of anger, in part because they understand each other wrong at first.
One of my clear memories of my previous work, mostly with men, is how once, while I was groaning with inexplicable rage, an older woman like me grabbed me by the door – a hateful manager I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did this to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thinking decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing that wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves situation.
Since it is late in the campaign, it is lagging behind in fundraising and decides it will not remain in the race if it fails to raise 2 million US dollars.
The battle is a preconceived failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would give only 250 dollars to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she declared that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was inundated by so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and to turn to voters, not delegates, but anger against sexism, that she felt it.
"A man may think that I have suffered a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder of how the media reacted.
"Some may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone?

How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is currently rising speed, a crash between the two countries will bring Beijing benefits in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning valve this year, betting on key export figures in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most escalating of the tension occurred this week with new duties affecting US dollar 200 billion (150 billion) production with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Every time Beijing returned with new duties with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every blow to the United States, and soon it is not expected that the second largest economy in the world will ignore this.
To make Washington give up means to submit to the demands, but to put a head down publicly to Washington would be too embarrassing for CJinpin, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards properly, pressure from the trade war with the United States can help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have previously recognised," said Abigail Grace, a research associate on issues related to Asia's expert group on new American security.
Syria is "ready" for refugee returns, foreign minister said
Syria announced that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in the restoration of the country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem pointed out that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by the terrorists to return them to their normal state.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and nutrition.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the restoration of the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe Wins Ryder Bath in Paris
Europe's team won Ryder Cup for 2018, overcoming the US team with a final score of 16.5 per 10.5 on Le Golf National in the extremities of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six consecutive losses on European land and has not won Ryder Bath in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points to guarantee victory over the United States.
US star Phil Michelson, who introduced himself poorly during most of the tournament, turned his first blow to the 16th hole (with a park 3) in the water, thus losing his match against Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been well introduced in all r , becoming one of the four players in the tournament's history, reaching 5-0-0 balance since the race took place in the current format since 1979.
The American Jordan Spitet lost his team's 5&4 with the player in Europe at the lowest spot in the rankings – Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for which this is probably the last part of Ryder Bath.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in Ryder Cup, became the European with the most won points in the tournament for all time, increasing its asset to 25.5 points this year.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
In everything, the team is most important and I am happy that I have been able to help," the excited Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He handed over the staff to his countryman John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2-1 to singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his overall balance at Ryder Cup is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, won 14 major titles – an indicator in which only Jack Niklaus retreats.
The U.S. team was having a hard time all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf in all the days of the tournament.
The captain of the US team Jim Furik said after a disappointing performance of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pushed Europe's team.
There was a battle.
I'm taking down Thomas's hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of professional golfers of the United States and our Ryder Bath Committee, and we will look ahead only.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just outplayed."
