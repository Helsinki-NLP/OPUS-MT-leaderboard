Members of the relevant assembly worry that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the assembly are appalled by the proposal to make new names for the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valižan Parliament.
The members of the assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the assembly of the laborists said that they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in a valid twp means a silly and pwp poop.
A member of the assembly from Plaid Cymru said that their group as a whole “is not satisfied” and proposed other options.
The Valižan conservative said that his group of "open spirit" regarding the change of name, while noting that between the words of the MWP and Muppet there was a slight difference in the pronunciation.
In this context, the pronunciation of the valid letter “w” is similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire order.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation for the presentation of name changes, stated: “The final decision on potential descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be adopted by members themselves.”
By law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valižan Assembly was authorised to amend its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valižan Parliament.
For members of the Assembly, the Commission has chosen the name "Welch Parliament Member" or "WMP", but in the public consultation the most support was given the option "MWP".
The members of the Assembly are clearly proposing other options, but achieving consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who must present draft amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the performance of the role of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on the legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide by referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday to make their country's name "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote aims to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens insisted for a long time that the name of their northern neighbours represented the right to their territory and repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of plebiscite on changing the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's Church are silent because the churches in Harlem are facing difficulties
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes the bar and the church were on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today it is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently today.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
In the church, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that it will be again soon.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with common administration (condominium), where people will live, who will not help shelters in the neighborhood that remain.
“The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that is why the day will come when all these churches will be closed down, as it is unlikely that the people who will move to these condoms will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s ’ decades later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community who served nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led by a fighter of sellers who did not want to hire or support black people.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building heavily, but when the parishioners planned to rebuild Johnson, they ordered racing bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly referred to the bells as “the bells of the poor people”.
The expert, who was racing in July, named them a little differently: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also stressed that these were the first racing bells played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he raced bigger bells.
Mr. Merryweather said that St. Martin’s church did not replace him.
In the Church of St. Martin’s there has been a complicated story with architects and contractors over the past few months; some have brought in church laikas and others are bishops.
In July, the Parish’s administrative body, consisting of laymen, wrote to the bishop to care about “trying to transfer costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old during lobster hunting in California
Officials report that a shark attacked and injured 13-year-olds during lobster hunting on Saturday at the opening of lobster hunting season in California.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard him scream for help, and then he and the group sailed to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just thrilled because he caught the lobster, and then he realized that he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed he had the whole key to his head.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: “In the water is a shark!” he added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water savior, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that several weeks earlier a shark was observed in the area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper hull.
The responsible for 48 hours disabled access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to the Swami’s beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Super Comrades and Debenhams with beautiful corners as they have in the department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of the entrance to the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing while the clothing sales and household appliances are falling, the bigger beautiful corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country and next year in more shops if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used earlier for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says that they will double the offer of their beautiful products on 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in trade-like brands such as Boots.
The supermarket also resuscitates its stupid offer of cosmetic products, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, a perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores of Sainsbury’s. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping for small quantities of food in local shops, supermarkets must work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores will be similar to wholesalers because the Supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s group opened Argos outlets in several hundred shops and also Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, increasing food sales and making the acquisitions more profitable.
Previously tried by the supermarket to renovate their sections with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, they ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s took on a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the link ended after the dispute over the division of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celeste, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds has been declared to play a role in this plan, as they are expected to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for counselling.
Our offer of brands is designed to suit all needs, attractive environments and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that presents a challenge for the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is "infuriating" because Holly Willoughby got out of work, worth 11 million pounds.
The star broadcasts Dragons Den (Good Job) angry because television host Holly Willoughby pulled out of the deal, worth £11 million, with his life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and Truly accessories.
The company of the business couple was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
Head of the show This Morning, 37, posted on Instagram to stand down.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den Peter Jones' star, as at the last minute she withdrew from their profitable business with a life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "infuriated" when a golden television girl on Tuesday during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of her new business, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, there was no longer enough time to dedicate herself to their brand of clothing and accessories to Truly.
The company compared the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and announced that it would double its assets to GBP 11 million.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly's brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: "Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely amazed all those involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the Marlow company, there is a warehouse full of goods prepared for sale.«
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this Morning, which is among the most interesting ties for banks in Britain, would cost the company millions because of large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays in opening up.
Moreover, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother, three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In March, he was appointed by Mr. Willoughby, with Cappo in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones, to join him as president.
The couple together holidayed, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV Show I”m A Celebritty.
A source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Tough talk “And then we fell in love”
He joked about media criticism because of a comment that some think is "non-presidential" and a positive opinion about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump, with his mocking "newsman" voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting, and their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the US's "appropriate response" to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States continues its sanctions, which continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results — they stopped the rocket testing, helped free the hostages, and brought home the remains of US soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
"It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded, full scene, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly ahead.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, it was said to foreign NGOs that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were resettled, they did not declare natural disasters, a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” said Sumbunga.
The Save the Children is made up of a team to travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutop, a representative of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu and determine whether they will allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the country remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
While shelters were built in Aceh after tsunami, on other shores, this is not a common practice.
It is likely that the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu contributed to the loss of lives, although a warning was in force.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship, which is in a position to help victims of an earthquake anchored in Lombok, sails towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improved Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for Jok's administration in the re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge won a late match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool before defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
"Sturridge accepted the Xherdan Shaqiri podium 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal at the back of his 1-0 team."
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the far neck.
The arrow traveled high over the penal space towards the right upper corner of the neck.
In the end, the ball went down through the goalkeeper of Kepa Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players, such as Shaq, always pull it as far as I could, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much more and simply chose to shoot."
At halftime, Chelsea led 1-0 with a hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker gave the ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half in this 5-point action.
The blacksmith was quick to pass in the middle and run forward.
Then he passed nicely through the defense, and Hazard ran into the criminal space.
Hazard beat the defense and shot him with his left foot at the far door through Liverpool's goalkeeper, Alison Becker.
On Wednesday at 3:00 p.m., Liverpool will meet with Napoli at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, in the group section of the League of Champions.
Chelsea waits for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that many people were being held for a degree of 7.5 earthquake, which triggered six metres of waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is packed with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old male on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police launched a murder investigation after a woman was found dead in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 p.m. at the Grayson Mews building on John Street and arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police are calling on everyone in the area who has seen or heard anything say.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also urge all, in particular, taxi drivers, who may have caught something in the footage of the car camera to contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the female was the resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene, who thought they knew a woman, and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are informing the women's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one should enter the building or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The residents were now told that it could take several hours before they could enter again.
Police officers heard him explain to a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps repeating "this is so terrible".
There were two police vans inside the cordon at 2 p.m., and another one right outside.
A lot of cops were standing inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
All those who have any information ask to write on @MerPolCC shall call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers to number 0800 555 111 and state the diary 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest memory target of the "rewriter of history" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical supporters of Puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society marked Crick’s proposal as “stupidness” and “the attempt to rewritten history”.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today's discussion of the removal of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminister Palace would become a target.”
There are no orders or executions to the iconocles in the English civil wars of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors of the last century.
The great presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies the 19th century opinion and is part of the history of personality that some think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is a number (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) to be seen as a protector of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate performance is the subject of ongoing historical discussions.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from when he was a Lord Protector also deserve celebrations and memories."
Murdering pig scavenging Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in the southwest of China.
A man identified only by the name of “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery and covered with blood in the vicinity of a pigsty at a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported at South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Porcine ray is preparing for the vaccination of pigs at the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin arrived on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the next pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig with a bloody mouth in his pighouse.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig had crushed a farmer to death.
“Brother’s Legs were bloody and dilated,” the cousins with the name “Wu” quoted the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks have been reported in humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, with the male suffering serious physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Valianian farmer against a tractor, but the woman then rejected the animal.
After eating a Oregon farmer in 2012, another manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not attackive, but the taste of blood can act as a "froster".
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown a sufficient measure of respect," he said.
U.S. South West due to the remains of hurricane Rosa comes heavy rain
Orcan Rosa is forecast to move toward colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico and weak.
However, in the following days, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and Southwestern America.
Rosa is from 5 a.m. in the week after the eastern hour of the hurricane 1st category with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure area moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States is strengthening over the Pacific Ocean. Rosa will be approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and pushing high tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, mixed with the low - pressure zone, will create abundant rainfalls in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, floods disposal and the possibility of natural beaches in the desert.
Due to the high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest parts, above most of Arizona in particular, it is expected that between 50 and 100 mm of rainfall.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into small rivers, and storms will bring local suns of wind and dust in the air.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
There may be rainfalls above 12 mm, which may result in a lower disposal of the naves and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical plates will begin to approach Arizona late on Saturday afternoon and early Monday morning, late Monday, and rainfall will spread on Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread across the sky on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October, high temperatures may occur in the United States, as the Arctic is cooling and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there are 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, the summer temperatures will try to stop and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern U.S. will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
We could have 27 °C in New York on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good options for temperatures above the US average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw on six television networks an interesting Thursday testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual assault that was due to occur in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued as television stations suspended a regular program due to a shift in the last minute: a deal drawn up by Arizonan Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was touching her and trying to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his bitter testimony that he was 100% convinced that this had not happened.
Nielsen reports that Friday's testimony to a mirror of more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted on average TV networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that performed the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems counting viewers who watch the program in offices.
For easier performances, ratings are similar to playing the football game finale or awarding awards to the American Film Academy.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The second is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the interest remained high.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning cameras of CNN and CBS television networks recorded the protesters shouting at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the construction process, he took a few minutes to show the views that captured the CNN television house's cameras live.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” a woman told him.
»Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and added that he would say more at the committee's hearing, and then the door to the elevator was closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to the vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate at the next week, which was called by the minority party of the Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to a friend of mine, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have a vote to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation into the U.S. Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of "playing political games" in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May criticised her exit plans for "playing political games" with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said that the proposal was for Britain and the EU to pay the other »very absurd« customs.
Shots fired at Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspected of the death of a LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to a police report from Baron Rouge, the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second degree murder.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said that between the battle Sims had lost his sunglasses.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he admitted that he shot Wade to death.
The security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A postcard from East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a preliminary report stating that a gunshot wound to the neck was the cause of death.
Police are thanking the special unit for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the inhabitants of the area for assisting in the investigation.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The previous season collected 5.6 points and 2.6 matches on average.
On Friday morning, LSU team coach Will Wade said that the team was "scanned" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” said Wade.
Vulcan ashes vomiting in Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes that the volcano Popocateptil vomits have reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Emergency Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the crater activity was reinforced and 183 gas and ash releases were recorded within 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunderstorming and earthquakes.
The pictures on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of cars in the neighborhoods of the city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have seen increased activity in a volcano that lies 72km southeast of the capital, after the 7.1-degree earthquake in September 2017 has shaken central Mexico.
The volcano called “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters who supported independence faced anti-incidental police units and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised secession vote.
A group of masked Separatist supporters who were detained by the riot police units were throwing eggs and metals at the powder, thus creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
There was also a fight later, and the police had to use them to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who cried out for several hours "without forgetting, without forgiveness", faced protesters who supported unity and cried out "Let Spain live!"
As local media reported, 14 people in protests received easier injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal in Madrid, and the Catalan separatists celebrated it, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although participation was low, as the opponents of the secession were largely boycotted by the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the voter vote in the region in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence camped in front of voters overnight to prevent demonstrations, thus supporting state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
The 68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had the hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry of happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although significant, although close to winning the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that support independence made it difficult to maintain this year's initiative because many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or are in custody awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in custody since the end of last year prior to the trial, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candiding in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who ran into the house by car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, were arrested because they ran into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place at the Ballinagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. in British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they were also supposed to fire a crossbow against the car.
He won the game, and he won the game.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston secure victory
He was the only one who had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as the coach of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot took care of the difference, as Gary Holt's team tied up with the Hibernian team in second place.
So Gerrard's team lost their winnings in this year's championship, and next week, Hearts is waiting for them, which leads on a scale that is eight points behind them.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European league on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his team of undefeated divisions to six games and coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, had not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston wastes chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led a long time before it hit, because with their directness the Rangers caused a number of problems.
Scott Robinson made it through, but he sent the ball over the neck frame, and then Alan Lithgow hit the doorways, and Craig Halkett shot it over the head.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for the guests at the time of the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson staged a campaign for Mengay, who shot and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had bigger possessions of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't get through, and the doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced the defense of Kelly.
The goalkeeper of the Rangers Allan McGregor, with his leg, defended Scott Pittman's shot, and Lithgow fired a goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingston's criminal space, but the locals refused all the attacks, two crimes — Halket's misdemeanor over Glen Middleton's replacement and a hand-in-hand offense — but the judge did not judge.
"Excellent performance" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingston.
Everyone was excellent and continued to exceed expectations on this path upwards.
The style of the game and the layout hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but Holt needs to be credited for the way he woke the team since his arrival.
There was a lot of hero.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and had well-organised defences, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert all the time.
And the Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although the Gerrards are well-managed, they are greatly lacking in standards.
There is a lack of goal shots – they have successfully overcome the defense of the hosts once – and this is some kind of a wake for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads prevented the crowd from collecting from the mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
The opinion was also expressed by hundreds of protesters – many of whom are Kurds – who do not support Erdogan's government and condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the separation of a visitor whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: The cyclist fatalally crashed in a car crash
In London, the cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a highway in Deptford, southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 p.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and the ambulances came, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred only a few months after the cyclist died in a run where the car driver fled, on Childers Street, approximately 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
Police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of a man so they can inform their relatives.
They set up roadblocks and diverted bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in the incident
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a heavily protected prison, reports from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. British summer time and is still ongoing.
Police officers from the Tornado Unit have called for an incident involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor facial injuries on the spot.
The prison staff representative said: “We have called on specially trained staff to take care of an incident at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff suffered injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence, and it is clear that the police will be taken away, and that may make them even longer behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison manager was reported in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, an anti-explosive unit of police called into prison to intervene in a major incident in which the staff were attacked by pool bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of the Orcana Rosa paves the way through the southwest desert and poses a danger to sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa was supposed to be furious over Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be close by late on Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) raged well 60km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Orcan Centre predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls of up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin, it is expected that between 25 and 50 mm of rainfall, individual rainfalls are possible up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of hurricane Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as there is currently a dry period in the southwest.
“According to the US Dry Tracking Centre, 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” reports Weather.com.
The Orcana Rosa route first leads to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of hurricanes on Sunday morning at the highest wind speed of 137 miles per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and thus weakens.
It is expected that the land in Mexico will reach with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The fall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a major flood threat.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with a possibility of 250 mm of rainfall,” reported on the Weather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then traveling through Arizona and towards southern Utah by late Tuesday.
“The greatest danger we expect from the Orcana Rosa or its remains is the abundant rain on the Bai Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the American southwest desert,” said the National Orcan Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earthly beaches in mountain areas.
Assault in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected attempted murder after they found 16-year-olds with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. British summer.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remained "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area at night, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police are calling on anyone who might have caught up with a cell phone to get in touch.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took unkindness and anger" of the democratic party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "took unkindness and anger" of the democratic party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the convention, with clear and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford was also testifying to her accusations.
On Saturday, the President said that the "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" that day.
"The voice for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an extraordinary record of public service," said a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh on an indirect basis when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really trying with the candidacy," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission of "supervising and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote in the Kavanaugh Appointing Chamber was to take place no later than Friday, the Republican Party's adviser told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people killed, victims rising
On Saturday, authorities reported that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them were carried off by giant waves butling along the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pala, when six metres of waves struck the coast at night and carried many to their deaths and destroyed everyone in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a power of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami was at risk yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian accident relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Cunami did not come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, he knocked everything down," he explained, adding that he traveled across the open sea at the speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, bent and broken bridges and seams surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
In the region with 2.4 million people, earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPT) said in a statement that the energy released in a strong earthquake is approximately 200 times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay is expected to increase the size of a tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added, 540 people were injured, and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be more than 300 km off the coast of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely broken and have no information from the Donggal area.
“There are over 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement and added that staff and volunteers are heading to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms as it failed to inform the public that the tsunamis were affected by Pala, but officials say the waves arrived just at the time of the issue of warnings.
In an amateur video published on social networks, it is heard men on the upper floor scream warning people on the street on the approaching tsunamis.
Within minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took the buildings and the cars with it.
The authenticity of the recording could not be confirmed immediately in Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a power failure that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still badly need food and other basic life supplies.
The City Airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dostobe, the members of the World Vision of Donggala arrived safely in Pala, where employees in the courtyard set up a shelter in front of their quarters from the airfields, but on the road they saw numerous scenes of desolation.
“I was told they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience would not allow their arrival in Pala.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, stocks and personnel aid shall only be allowed if the site of the accident is declared as an area of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still seen as an accident at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says “okay, this is a national disaster”, we can accept international aid, but there is no such status.”
The second night after the rest of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of missing persons hold back hope that their nearby wonders are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman trapped under the ruins for two days, along with a body lying next to her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian sailing team, was training two missing sailboats for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others caught at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, according to Mr. Mandagi.
“As an age in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated throughout the community of sailing falls, he was desperate to send messages to whatsapp competitors in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of two blue ones.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thiefs stole $26.750 while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Leve
According to a Newport police report, the thieves stole $26.750 from the Brink's security guard Friday morning who filled the ATM in Newport on the Leve.
The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was employed, another man “accessed to Brink’s employees from behind” and stole a bag of money to deliver.
According to the report, witnesses saw more suspects running from the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
All persons with information on the identity of suspects should call the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper change your name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – to Ye.
On Saturday, he wrote: "The Being with the official name Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of its eighth album, published in June.
The change comes just before his performance in the Saturday Night Live show in which he is due to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who cancelled the performance for "personal reasons", said the creator of the show.
The word is an adornment to his current professional name, but West has already said that the word for him has religious meaning.
“I think that the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means you”, said West at the beginning of this year when he spoke to Big Boy about the album title.
"So it's you and me all.
Kanye, which means “the only” I have changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects everything we are."
Kanye is one of many famous pirates who changed their name.
This year, Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West's associate, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without his thoughts and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to use military forces against civilians, just as the state is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised that he would “never use an army to suppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, at a peaceful demonstration on the market on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and to open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education draws young people into criminal associations.
US should double financing artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it spends on research in this area, says the investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have predicted the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are significant for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Supersile Art Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order), was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American player of the Othello game, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous American government technological competitions, such as a robotics competition organised by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when will be next to help find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US must work hard to obtain state support, Lee said.
"It is not China that takes over the best academics, but those companies," Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed the best in universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China The National Foundation for Natural Science is funding people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are dividing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of two billion USD.
National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
In the meantime, the American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians to decide on changing the country's name at referendum
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted on whether or not to turn their country's name into a "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This would solve decades of debt dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and the boycott campaign doubted that participation would be at least 50 %, as far as necessary, for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for joining the authorities such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, is one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be free to live under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote that will be decided.
The change in the name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national electoral commission has announced that no irregularities have been reported by 1:00.
However, only 16% was involved compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško delivered their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Before parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurosy integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring a highly needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the launch of his ballot.
He added that the positive result would be "confirming our future".
The poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that a referendum would take place between 30 and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the necessary voter participation.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the vote must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first more serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government, which took over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overplayed Brighton's entire defense and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in the 2-0 Battle of Manchester City on Saturday.
Aguer's hit in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously simple.
At the start of the campaign, the Argentinean attacker took the show in the middle of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defense actors and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one of the defense players and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
With his first touch in the criminal space, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguer, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is facing foot problems,” City coach Pep Guarddiol told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored naked at that moment.«
But Sterling was the one who provided blues with the initial advantage in the duel of the first English League.
He scored naked in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Saney on the left.
Sanne touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the remote neck.
The Blue Blue Attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal line.
On Tuesday, at 12.55 p.m., in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, in the group section of the League of Champions, he will meet Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies and spoil their title options.
The Nationals team is out of the picture, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he can climb up the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the chance to play in the finals, because in the West League they have the advantage over the team of Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies provided themselves on Friday with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals team with the least invite of the organizer, but they still await their first address in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we can play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver, and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet published the names of the first pitcher for Sunday, but in this case, they'll probably be throwing Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal for 34th time, is on Thursday as a relief player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The D.C. right-winger collected this season 18 wins and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 and 300 strokes in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The president touched on the situation of his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really trying with the candidacy, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats and this is what is happening right now.
They're determined to take over again, and they're going to use every means possible.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
According to him, the Democrats are on the mission of "supervising and obstructing".
"And you could see this in the last four days," he said, and named the Democrats as "the angry, mean, lowly, and lying".
In his name, he pointed out a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, and a loud disapproval was heard from the audience.
"Do you remember her reply?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait. This was really bad body language, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When an activist of the Momentum organization in my local client gave me a mistrust, that wasn't even a surprise.
After all, I am last in line with the members of parliament of the Labour Party, which is not desirable for expressing my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was similar because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a non-confidential proposal for my inconsistencies with Jeremy Corby.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In the notice of the meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East, it said that “we wish the meetings were inclusive and productive”.
In eight years, as far as I am a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly the same.
Today, most meetings are unfortunately not used in such a tone, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly apparent that the various views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and that each opinion considers whether this is acceptable for the client's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, who I thought we had previously shared similar political views, expected me to change my mind and take points that I would never agree with – whether it would be in the field of national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks calling for non-election, condemning the policy of the middle and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Actually, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I'm about to make are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but do not let them be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of policy is how abuse rates have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with any motion of non-confident or a change of choice rules, the party becomes more narrower.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to put my head away and not to be so loud, and I'll be "all right".
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago – this led to the negligence of the Tatcher government, which is why the classroom in my elementary school has literally collapsed — I have tried to advocate better public services for those who need it the most.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused because of my political views and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is sailing against the Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threats to non-election or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: the undefeated Ayr on the top of the scale
Two familiar attempts have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned a victory in this wonderfully fun championship match of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale, and they're the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, the scale on the home side passed their top defenses and improved the exploitation of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had good reason for satisfaction.
“In our matches so far we have passed many tests and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayra team, opportunities have been better used than we have.”
The hit by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute turned by Frazier Climo, Ayr led the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with the Warriors, was a numerical advance for Melrose and Jason Baggott, intercepted an attempt without conversion.
At the time of the misdemeanor, Climo increased leadership for Ayr before hitting at halftime and then converted an independent attempt for the result 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggott down five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, which was taken on the stretchers, and afterwards Ayr progressed by the attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was transformed by Climo.
Ajora's temporary captain, Ayra Blair MacPherspon, then received a yellow card and Melrose re-used the game with a player more with an unconverted experiment of Bruce Colvino at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Clima without a ball, MacPherson scored a hit in the attack.
Clemmo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's gunshot and sent wingman Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the host.
The Still Game Star starts a new career in the hospitality
The Star of Still Game Ford Kieran seems to be going to the hospitality, at least it's supposed to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with his long-standing partner in the Comedys of Greg Hemphill.
Two people reported that after the next ninth season, Kiernan is already planning to live in Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested for Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to join in the »flower hospitality« in Glasgow.
“The Sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol at the seat of the Navy in La Paso.
In public buildings, Navy blue flags are enhanced.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicak to Amazona are covered with a slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute caused by natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — just like the longing for a refloat across the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court, which will be received after five years of consultations on 1 October.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects the result in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivians will look at the international court's decision on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of intermittent talks, Chile must negotiate the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Here comes Morales, the Bolivian charismatic indigenous president, who is expected next year by a controversial battle for re-election, also has high expectations of Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts feel that the court will not decide for Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands is not authorised to grant Bolivia a Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after listening to the final arguments means that the case “was not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, they have not spoken in behalf of Bolivia, but may cost much.
“The current Bolivian government used the question of access to the sea,” Záratev said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric gave rise to all the goodwill she may have left behind from Chilens, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The state hasn't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually rapid decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139-year-old disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States of America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States has called on them to fulfill their promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement came at a time when U.S. Minister Mike Pompeo was apparently before the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the United States is wrong to think that continuing sanctions and objecting to the forecasts of the Korean war will get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is careful when fixing the forecast without first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about quitting the weapon, which the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest line of huge covers coming to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of covers or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to look forward.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in their spring and summer 2019 collections a collection of weird overcoats that blinded the style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers were flooded by Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular designs to the fashion runway.
Valentine's piece, which stood out the most, was a beige hat with broad places decorated with feathers similar to those in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion supplements included watermelons with precious stones, a magic hat and even pineapple — but your head will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter's masks than high fashions.
One creation was similar to those used to dive with breathers and glasses, and the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
The fashionable know-it-alls predict that the giant blankets will come to the shops near you.
The wide hats are closely followed by “La Bomby”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter places, were seen in Rihanna and Emily Ratakowski, among others.
The cultural brand for the extremely unpractical hat that flooded social networks sent another big creation — a straw beach bag almost as large as a model in the swimsuits she was wearing.
In a burnt orange-colored bag covered with rhafi and a white leather handle, at the Paris Fashion Week, the central piece of the La Riviera designer Jacquemus collection was for spring/summer 2019.
Stilist of famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops for next summer – because the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements."
John Edward: Language knowledge is crucial for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results on exams that are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Free Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
The independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they hold as global citizens.
As an education sector that can form and implement a tailored school programme, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation is in his head.
But if you talk to a person in his mother tongue, words can be in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that languages at the top of the scale are the highest levels of performance in independent schools.
68 percent of foreign language students achieved excellent grades.
The data collected in the 74 schools of the ScIS Council of Scotland showed that 72 percent of students achieved excellent grades in Mandarin and 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are considered the same as those in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics as they are selected in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 showed that, for reasons for which employers are struggling to fill free jobs, 17 percent are attributable to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language knowledge is increasingly becoming necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
In future employment opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great privilege in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouGov survey, covering more than 4000 adults in the UK, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15 percent.
Therefore, investment in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have better opportunities to find adequate employment.
In Scotland, schools vary in languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Regardless of the interests of your child, it will always be possible to select a number of languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need for success, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, and this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Single Schools Council
LeBron's due in San Diego on Sunday in Laker's dress
For fans who look forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the waiting will soon be over.
Coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in Sunday's pre-seasonal game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton explained on the official website of the Lakers team.
On Twitter, the official rapporteur for Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of Lakers before the season.
“In this phase of my career to prepare I don’t need games before the season,” he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a series of conventions in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned conventions in the next week, including the stops in its favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wishes to win support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are threatened with the loss of control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's convention in West Virginia be, and where on the Internet will he be able to see it?
Trump's convention in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held on Saturday 29 September 2018 at 1am Eastern Time.
The Trump convention in West Virginia can be seen live on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, who became tense on charges of sexual misdemeanour, which is why Senate approval is expected to be postponed for one week to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help Republicans, who are waiting for important elections in November, to gain new momentum.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five conventions were designed “to encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“The supervision in Congress is so important for its programme that the President will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult campaign season” said a Tromp campaign representative to Reuters, who does not want to be named.
Today’s Wesbanco Arena convention in Wheeling could be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to reports from the West Virginia MetroNews Radio, which would attract interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in public research.
“It is a bad sign for Morrisey that the president must come and raise him” in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope against Sunday's individual fights
After three one - sided games, it may have been Saturday afternoon's two-way (foursome) match that he needed this year's Ryder Cup.
The niche is a completely fictional sports concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So, where's the pendulum going now?
"They had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so it's probably a new momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead, and 12 can get it.
But the Americans, according to Spieth, feel that the wind is in the sails, and, among other things, they are encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was destined from the initial blow to the vegetables and set a good example.
The cries of happiness became louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and his two-point lag behind in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory in the 15th hole accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You just need to find your inner strength and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
Strange, but charming two Europeans have won four points out of four and are unmistakable.
The two "Mollywood" were the only ones who didn't hit the buggy on Saturday afternoon, and the buggy was avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way that the energy between them and the noisy audience seems to flow confirms the fact that they are the two players who will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could have been better able to seal the possible victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun hits the Le Golf National Playground.
Probably both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about the European celebration would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to the boogies and two double boogies at the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis from which they had not found a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and duels of two are exceptionally accompanied by close communication between couples, the advice they give themselves, the advice they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of the two have shown that the US team also has a desire for victory, which some, particularly on the American side, have doubted.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe is going on the last day of Ryder's Cup with a fine advantage after having saturday games with four balls and two two twos leading from 10:6 to the United States.
The great couple, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave their best and, with two victories over Tiger Woods and at the Le Golf National Course, traded four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to win the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, had in the morning four-ball games more powerful than the American team that sinned and led in a series of 3-1s.
The U.S. team fought better in the duels of two men who won two games but couldn't catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newspaperman to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the couple were named "Molliwood") after the sensational end of the week only the second couple who won four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder's Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then re-proved and more convincingly defeated the expendable Woods and the American newspaper Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for moments, but lost 19 out of 29 games in four balls and two doubles, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duels of two two and paired with Henrik Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were listed first and third in the world scale.
On a pleasant, windy day in the southwest part of Paris, however, not everything went according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they won a decisive victory against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the duels of two of them, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team came back after four points behind, even though Fury's team only needs a match to keep the trophy going.
But after two days in second place, Sunday's counter-attack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “We will by no means unilaterally disarm”
On Saturday, the foreign minister of North Korea announced to the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions led to a growing lack of confidence in the United States and that, under such conditions, North Korea would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this global body, Ri Jong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has taken a number of "important measures in a sign of goodwill" such as stopping the implementation of nuclear and missile experiments, supporting the city for nuclear experiments and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the right US response," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be convinced of national security, and under such conditions we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaints made by North Korea regarding the resistance of Washington to a gradual nuclear disarmament approach, as part of which North Korea would have been awarded for the adoption of gradual measures, his statement was important because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri was attached to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the top of the current US President and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June. At that time, Kim committed to working towards "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised security.
North Korea wanted an official end to the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not give in to the invitation to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The United States insists that we must first disarm ourselves nuclearally and step up pressures by sanctions in order to achieve its goals by forcing them to achieve their goals, and even object to the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The thought that sanctions could get us down on our knees is an unrealistic hope of people who don't even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted at the United Nations meeting at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Je Ino, which took place in the past five months, adding: "If we had discussed the nuclear disarmament problem with South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have agreed to such a dead spot."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was quite different from last year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the inland part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump Kim was designated as “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he had a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no timeframe for this, and stated: “Train can be two years, three years or five months – this is not important.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue with no exceptions until we recognize the complete, complete and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
He met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he stated that progress had taken place and North Korea had criticised him for several hours later, saying that his demands were supposed to be "gangster".
At a meeting with Mun, which took place this month, North Korea committed to destroy the missile testing station and nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States takes "appropriate action".
I was supposed to tell Kim that the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington were meant to be "adequate measures".
Harvard University students attend a course in which they learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of this year's new Harvard University course is to teach all undergraduate students how to get more sleep. With such a course they want to fight the growing mascist culture of "all-night" learning, where the power builds up caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that, after his first such species in the United States.
He chose to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I only find out now that I'm in my senior year?"
She said no one's ever told her how important the sleeper is, and the Daily Telegraph said that it surprised him.
This year's first course speaks of the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sports success, as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University of Health Services, says that such a course was decided when they found that the students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The single-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the door to the student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants find that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
»We are aware that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride with the “sufficient all-night learning” is still present. He adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, represent growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of high-quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. This also prevents weight gain – the brain from becoming hungry because of lack of sleep, which is why students are constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student named Raymond So he helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, he attended one of his professor's lectures at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes to be able to ask postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme at the next stage before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a sleeper alarm, as well as waking up. He also wants to remind them of the harmful effects of the “blue light” displayed by electronic screens and LED-lights, because they can cause imbalances in the Circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menge with a hit sunk by Gerrard's team hopes
Rangers once again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston pronounced team Steven Gerrard condemned to defeat from 1 :0.
The team from Ibrox hunted their first guest victory after the February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium 4-1, but Gary Holt's team beat her second in 18 matches since he headed the Gerrard team, with his team leading the Scottish League eight points behind.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected range of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to make it even.
This led to Rangers falling to a common spot, and Livingston progressed to third place, but with the difference of goals the Hibernian team was lagging behind
Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when, according to reports, an object arrived from the city of the roaming team's cheerleading team.
Gerrard in a crew that had no difficulty defeating Ayr and was assigned to the Batfred Cup semifinals, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified 1st Livingstone, who had taken a point from the Hearts team a week before, and was no doubt thrilled about how his liquefied team effectively neutralized all attempts by guests.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start of Menga, with the first short pass, found Scott Pittman, then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but he was a binder in the execution of the inaccurable and missed opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halket, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed hope more than the actual desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the fight with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, a criminal shoot was to be fired, but Judge Steven Thomson put the Colombian request in the call.
The Rangers were able to put only two shots to the goal for the first half, but not the head shot sent to the goal by Lassan Coulibaly, nor the tiny ball of Ovie Ayari, was no threat to the goalkeeper of Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but he was already fully earned because of his perseverance.
Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs extension with a long pass.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Menge for a simple conclusion to the attack.
During his vacation, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with a wingman named Ryan Kent, who immediately showed up with the Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests to play, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more podiums in front of the goal.
Holt's team could still increase the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow after the pass from the corner was inaccurable.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton got the chance to shoot him after he contacted Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't recognize him.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
We represent the site of almanacs of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, which is today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany, "Hans" Geiger, who later became a world-renowned physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity; this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
He became a permanent in the scientific world, and he also gained his place in pop culture, for example in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: »This is Geiger counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect it has on atoms of radioactivity in materials."
Evans: "Madonka, now they're talking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to identify attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to identify the attack cells and destroy them.
The vaccine in the course of therapy learns the immune system to recognize the attack cells
This method includes the production of immune cells of a patient who is then transformed into a laboratory
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient.
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise attack cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes obtaining immune cells from a patient who changes them to the laboratory so that they can “see” HER2 protein that is characteristic of a number of forms of cancer and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda in Maryland said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancer” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells in patients who are “teached” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
After performing on SNL, Kanye West performed a pro-Tramp spot with MAGA on a cap.
The audience wasn't thrilled.
He was also a member of the "Saturday Night Live" studio at a strange point, where he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the presidential seat.
After the final performance with a third song of his performance called "Gost Town", during which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Great Again", the West launched an attack on the Democrats and reiterated its support for Trump.
“It’s often that I’m talking to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved away from America a long time ago," right.
This performance of SNL began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood player became insane from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission, accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but was uploaded to social media by a comedian named Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was planning on making fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some problems with the hat writings.
"After the stage, they went after me.
They told me “Do not go to the stage with this hat. ”
They harassed me!
But they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner's report.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he must put on “Superman's robe because it means that no one can order me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments prepared the audience at least twice for whistles, and the members of the SNL team were clearly embarrassed, and someone told Vanity also: "In the studio there was a death silence."
At the last minute, West was invited by a goat replacement for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, raper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
West has caused many wonders already with the video after the song »I Love it«, where he wore the costume of a bottle of Perrier's mineral water.
West was supported by Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being AID."
And Karen Hunter's speech host tweeted that West is simply what it is, and it's just fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, wearing or supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, welcomes and extends the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and that from now on he will be "a creature formally known as Kanye West. I am now YE."
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, he's already done it to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His flatmate Snoop Dogg was once named Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: The Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an artist, once known as Prince.

The star of the Game of the thrones Kit Harrington stared sharply against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for his sword whirring as Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval colored fantasy series Game of thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who has strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero says that the appearance of such roles on the screens often makes young boys feel that respect can only be earned with hardness.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something had gone wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the period of movement #Me too.
The actor, who recently married a 31-year-old teammate from the Rose Leslie Games, admitted to having strong beliefs about this subject.
“I personally am serious about where we made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
“What did we teach men during growing up about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to the display of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is taught?
What do they teach us on TV and on the streets that young boys feel like they have to choose this particular side of manhood?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change that?
Because there was obviously something wrong with young men.«
In the interview, he also said that after the series's end next summer he will not participate in recording any premeditation or continuation of the Games of the thrones because he has "completed with the battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will play a major role in the new performance of True West Sam Shepherd, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of thrones was that he met his wife Rose on the set.
“I met my wife because of this show, so she gave me my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte in the fantasy series awarded by Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were around 40,000 new cases reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was transmitted by sexual relations, which is a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials, from the Junan Conference, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS continues to increase annually in China by 100,000 people.
Transposition of HIV with sexual relations is a very pressing problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against those from the LGBT community is still very much present.
Since conservative values are still in force in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women, according to the results.
The disease is often tolerated due to inadequate protection of sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general access to HIV treatment medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to issue information about Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "contribution theories"
On Saturday, US congresswoman Maxine Waters dropped charges that a member of her staff had published information on three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A democratic girl from Los Angeles claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites of the far right.
"Lyings, lies and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in a statement in Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
These data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment of a candidate for the Supreme Judge, Brett Kanough.
The leak occurred after the three senators completed the Kavanaugh hearing.
The conservative websites such as the Gateway Pundit and the RedState state that through IP, it is possible to identify the source of the publication that is supposed to be connected to Senator Waters' office and conclude that information has been published by one of the staff, reports Hill.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure” continues Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leak of this data.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure.«
Senator Waters' online statement quickly came across criticisms, including the former White House official, Ari Fleischer.
"From this denial of the branch of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This may mean that it is not a true test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn't do, they can't show anger.
He mustn't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is taking part in the interim elections for Waters, came forward via Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her cabinet had informed “the relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed” she continued, “and will answer for all the acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as secret agent
The search for clues on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also applicable to the recovery of the Johnny English Action Comedy, which first came on screen in 2003 entitled Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title Johnny English 2.
Is it gonna be a fun satire about how bad we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English gets permission to re-mix the crevices; its name suggests that it is a comical character created for cinematic audiences in non-English-speaking areas.
It's an awkward secret agent, which despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the one that contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveller and an international mystery man, who was once played by Atkinson in an already forgotten TV advertisement for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real mess.
Although one or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, he wore a medieval armor, and the rotor list was short-lived on his helmet.
Atkins' gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "really" films, such as 007 or Mission, are impossible to offer without the bad news right now.
It seems as though humor is intended for children and not so many adult viewers, and therefore for me to reject Johnny English's events are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson's silent sketches as Mr. Bean's role.
A permanent subject is now evident that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the web network of British most secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great difficulties to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of fracture for the prime minister, the pompous figure, who has already suffered a fracture because of political unlovingness: Emma Thompson has tried the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that could help her.
It shall be informed by the intelligence service that all active spies are exposed and therefore must choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a respected school who is informally teaching how to work undercover: here are the screenwriters hit because English performs some kind of spy "cademia of rock".
They're taking English to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where they meet a longtime associate of Bough played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotyped sports artist, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is lost little.
By doing so, Batman and Robin are ready to create even more problems in the name of Her Majesty's secret service, and they meet the fatal Ophelio Bulletovo played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously going under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Walt played by Jake Lacey.
The English and Bough start their odyssey: dressed in a waiter set fire to the French restaurant, create chaos when he smuggles onto the roof of the Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses to see the inside of Walt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the latter part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite its sympathy and energy, it reminds us of a child’s film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think: is a British film capable of giving Atkins a role that actually justifies his talent?
Laburs deny that they are planning a four-day working week for the British, and they would be paid for a five-day working week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyna is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment for five days.
The party wants the company leaders to shed their savings from the revolution of artificial intelligence, spill it over to workers and give them the extra day off.
That way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the party's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of workers.
Unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A source from the Labour Party declared for The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve through the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea as the four-week working week of its campaign in the general elections in 2017 was supported by the Green Party.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-week working week is not the party’s policy and the party is not considering it.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to cut the power of the “insidious directors” and “rewarders” in the utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current stakeholders in the water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party could, on the grounds of alleged injustices, introduce “reductions”.
It also confirmed plans for the inclusion of workers in administrative committees and the introduction of equity inclusion funds, thus transferring 10 per cent of the share in private companies to employees receiving annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy in the 60-minute show ("60-minute") discussed whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, carried out by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was submitted on Sunday, the correspondent for the show "60 minutes" of Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if she could discover anything, which would change her mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“Before the hearing began, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this accusation came out, I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’?’
He was determined, unrestrained, unambiguous."
And Graham's voice seems to be carved into stone.
“I created my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know the following: Brett has strongly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
»And none of those she called could confirm
The case is 36 years old.
I see no new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, a annual music event involving a truly remarkable type of stars with equal extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this time for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Great Trat of Central Park not only to enjoy performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizens' Festival is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international defence group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their objective of poverty elimination.
But how is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to take action, or is it just another example of so-called "clitivism" – creating the belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation by signing online petitions or passing on tweets?
The Global Citizen movement says that since 2011, more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters are expected to record their efforts for a range of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped global leaders to accept commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group stated that the fruit of its actions was to be 390 commitments and messages on the basis of which at least 10 billion USD had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Food (The Power of Nutrition), the Partnership of Investors and decision-makers, committed to helping children achieve their full potential, which Rwanda promised $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets of the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can put social injustice in historical archives” said the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018, Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the Power Food Partnership.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts were carried out by the government, which called for the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, it announced that it would co-finance the Food Power Project, which would achieve 5 million women and children through food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
the movement Global citizen replied: "This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Among some performers who will perform at this year's event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy – the US Interior Ministry – as a “blockado” for Russian energy exports
According to a report by the newspaper Washington Examiner, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (to be warned that at the invitation of the legal governments) there is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they are marketing it in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” I would say.
However, in the opinion of the functional officer, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy ensures that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to prevent Russian energy users from getting into the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to participants in the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that refers to it as "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less fuel impact and their replacement," he said, denoting Russia as a "poon known to one trick", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when Trump's administration seeks to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is expected to push Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's Government, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which is why Berlin is supposed to be "the hostage" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is expected to double existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a tool for the pressure and that consumers must have the right to select suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Union of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Involving a third country in our energy supply means a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kemp, head of the German Industry Union (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "expectly study" her candidacy in the election for the US President in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "expect carefully" her candidacy for the American president after the mid-term elections.
In the Hollywood city house in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider candidacy.
“It is time to go to Washington women and correct our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” said according to a report by Officer The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will examine my candidacy for the president closely."
At a meeting at the city hall, Warren was being rebuked by President Donald Trump, as "this country is going to lead the wrong way."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren's President of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, had repeatedly been criticised by Trump and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court.
On Friday's tweet, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters feel that Warren's 2020 should not stand up for president.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Political Research Centre/Volk Magazine Boston Globe, the senator should not be running for president, eighty-five percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that it had greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of respondents supporting it and 48 per cent opposed it.
The other senior Democrats, who would consider running for office in the 2020 elections, are former Vice President Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to a report by the Associated Press agency, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palina at a meeting in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his military entry.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son is experiencing after he returns connects me with other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain amount of injuries that our soldiers return to," Oklahoma told the audience at a meeting to support Donald Trump in Tulsa.
Palin’s son’s arrest was marked “in the salon” and said that her son and other veterans were returning to a slightly changed, hardened, wondering where respect for what the fellows and airmen and all the other members of the army had donated to the country.”
The Palina tape was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by attacking women, obstructing domestic violence and possession of weapons in wine, said Dan Bennett, representative of the Wasilla Police Station.
18 Federal States and Colombia County support the ban on new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the Colombia County support the legal rebuttal of a new U.S. policy that denys the right to asylum to victims who flee against domestic violence or violence.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the aforementioned district filled the courtroom on Friday to support the legal challenge of politics.
The entire name of the defendant in the lawsuit against Grace v. Sessions, which was not published by the U.S. Civil Liberties Association against Federal Policy.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the gang", abused her, but on July 20, the US authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace, Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum applications in the United States came, described them as constantly coping with domestic gangs and violence.
In 2014, the new US Asylum Policy repealed the Committee's decision to call on immigrants, who are unrecognizable immigrants fleeing domestic violence, made it possible to apply for asylum.
State Prosecutor of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "respects decades of state, federal and international law".
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application and that such prohibition violates the principle,” states the court’s request.
State prosecutors further stated in the request that a policy that denyes immigrants the right to enter harms the American economy, since these are more likely to become entrepreneurs and are "providing the necessary workforce".
State Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in their publication of politics on 11 June.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, when she comforted her hot boyfriend at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Pal.
"The rescue workers are constantly bringing in the bodies.
There is no clean water."
It looked like the locals, returning to the destroyed homes that broke through the wetlands and tried to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a grade 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, rested outside of a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open as a result of persistent severe earthquakes.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was pushed against the ruins of the walls," Harris told Associated Press agency.
"I heard the woman calling for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
The US ambassador accuses Chinese "supervised" with "propaganda ads"
One week after the publication of a four-way advertisement in the U.S. daily newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to Beijing accused the abuse of US press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned the paid addition of Officer China Daily in the Journal of Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa after he accused China of interfering with the US Congress elections on November 6th, and China denied it.
Reuters reported that US federal officials had described Trump's accusation that Beijing had tried to interfere with the US federal elections as a new phase in the increasingly intense efforts of Washington to push China.
Even though foreign governments are used to publish commercial promotional ads, Beijing and Washington are currently complicated in an ever-intensive trade war, in which they exchange blows by introducing customs duties on imported products.
China's recovery tariffs at the beginning of the trade war are expected to hit exporters in federal countries, such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, were said by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had been hit by US workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, “now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese Government used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish the paid ad in the Journal of Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions expressed by Chinese citizens on the worrying Chinese economic routes, because the schools are strictly controlled by China's Communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the tender for publication" of his article, although he did not state which one.
Republicans lose voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts point out that despite several of the most important Republicans to support and advocate a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several sexual assault charges, she will be aware of the upcoming interim elections with the loss of voters.
Feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be restored," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Sirakuza for an article published on Saturday in the newspaper The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute was enough to appease angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget this either tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the Progressive MoveOn, on Friday, after reporting Officer Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!", when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when Republicans who oversee the Judicial Committee decided to further support Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported the news portal Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all limits,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst, to the press.
"People say they're strong now, and that's true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undefined voters in suburban and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president, but don't often vote."
Even prior to the public testimony of Ford, in which she detailed her accusations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a major confusion for GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, according to a NBC News report in the beginning of last week.
"It's not only the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh oath; it's also how Republicans deal with it and how they dealt with Ford," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities Group, who supported the Democrats in the elections.
The Americans, however, seem to be slightly divided between whether to believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, and to support the latter slightly more.
A new survey by YouGoov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or most believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they certainly or most believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh was probably lying or definitely lying about the Fords, and that was only 30 percent of them.
After the pressure of FLA, FBA is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, and at least one of the defendants, Deborah Ramirez, reported by Officer The Guardian.
Last week, at the Senate Court under oath, Ford testified that Kavanaugh, at the age of 17, attacked her in a vindictive state.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her the gender when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The World Online Artist intends to start a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the world's Internet inventor, is opening a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of this technology legend, Inrut, is the company that builds on the Berners Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta’s aim was “to rule the world”.
“We have decided to do it now,” he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable users to create a "personal storage warehouse" or a pod
This may include contact details, job lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this "personal data empowerment".
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of the company is to pool resources, processes and adequate skills that will allow the Solid platform to be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several hired developers for project work and the community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers worldwide could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrut website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google do not talk about whether they could introduce a complete change that could put an end to all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrut’s purpose was to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet by establishing a consortium of World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the consortium World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next age of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Festival of the Bearer of Victoria's First World War Cross
For 100 years now, in their home town they have celebrated the award of Victoria's cross to the only priest of the Church of England, who won it as a fighter in the first world war.
Dear Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned his confession on 29 September 1918 in an attack against Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never knew that this highest British military honor had been given to him.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was discovered on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel’s grandchildren.
One of the great-grandkids, Michael Vann, said that it was "extremely symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after Grandpa's act to earn the medal.
According to Officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his battalion through St. Quintine's Channel "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire from the battlefield and machine guns."
He later set out towards the firing line and led the line forward with the "greatest heroism" and then attacked and hit three members of the squad.
Lt Col Vanna is 4 October 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war – shot a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of an old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he also laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade” and that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support of many people.”
The fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, Pujse Pepe was given.
Imagine: You stayed up all night watching the completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main parquet, and was broadcast live on channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to comply, the UK viewers were amazed to find that the transfer had been replaced by the performance of the Pujs Pepa cartoon.
Many people were not thrilled because he stayed awake until morning because of the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch on a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 am, so they had to switch to a children’s programme,” said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Bellator marketing and communication organisation when asked about the transfer.
"Puise Pepa."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that viewers in the United Kingdom would be involved in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could sort this out,” said Cocker.
"But then it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged at the switch, and not everyone was nice.
We tried to arrange the matter; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the actual reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will have five fights — as usual. We have tried to offer more than we expected, and we have counted on them.
It is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “unworthy about sexuality”.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt less valuable than anyone — but it gave him a motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that "not every one" as it is, had been seduced upon entering high school.
During the first Desert Island Discs interview, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio Station 4 he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
A regular host of a longtime broadcast, Kirsty Young, has been absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in Laverne’s first show, said that he felt “less worthy” than everyone else, because “it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls.”
He said: "To date, these feelings of undervalue and diversity are a real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, that he would not disappoint anyone who finally found out about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic competitor has become an influential advocate of LGBT-rights and has twice appeared at the Games of the Nations in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality this year.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that a romance with a man – American film maker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he met in 2013 – "surprised".
Daley and his winner, who was 20 years old, married last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died – he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar rises and downs.
The couple adopted a child in June, son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "full view".
“If you asked me last year, it would be all I had to say that ‘I have to reach the gold medal’,” he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley’s father Robert, who died in 2011 in the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the front row," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally had to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
He was the first to be named in the 19th century.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in Olympic games before the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of songs – the Proud of Musicist Heather Small, who was accompanied by him in preparation for the Olympic Games and where his skin is still soressing.
Desert Island Discs broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson's Saturday Ryder's Cup sat down
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to go back to shape so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the record 12th time, left Captain Furyk sitting on Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the center of what happened as often as it was for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day partially as a fan and partly in improving his game in order to fix what he was trying to do.
Given that even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old does not match the best golf course, where the long ice inevitably punishes the wrong blows.
And if the playground itself wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will be dealing with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari Cup in the ninth game of the game this week, which was linked to the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals had four less matches, were to start out well, the Mickelson game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, otherwise he did not say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today, beat me in the back and held me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's one of the celebrities, and in the past, and this week, he's made an extraordinary contribution to the teams.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that was how it came out, and we thought it had to be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the largest number of matches played in Ryder Cup Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's Cup's career, which never really coincided with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equalitys, but Furyk said that his presence in the team also brings some inconspicuous benefits.
“He’s fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they met with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage can soon be over
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in Ryder’s Cup can easily be turned into an awkward ride.
In 1997, young Danec debuted at the race in Valderrama, where the site, whose captain Seve Ballesteros, had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the goal he went through with a hair-only advantage, with a result of 14ths-13ths.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in the Valderrama where we won, but barely," Bjorn (in the picture) said after watching the Class of 2018 team, which won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led the Le Golf National course with 10-6.
So history to me and everyone on the team shows that the cup isn't over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
It's not over until it says so on the board.
We have the goal of winning this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
It has already been said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Exciting the game of his players at the demanding playground Bjorn added: "I would never have passed here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
There will be a game of individuals tomorrow, so it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, your golfing skills are tested to the end.
This is a message that you must convey to the players: tomorrow you must draw out the best.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself too."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turnovers in the last day, because in Brookline he was part of the winning team before he ended up a winner when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, took out his players on the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as quickly as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
Once this momentum has gained endurance, it exerts great pressure on the mid-games.
We created the right layout and put the boys in a way that we felt that tomorrow we would do something magical."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to fight the battle and fighting Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I chose this order with this group of boys because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the choice of individuals.
New German warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be submitted to use in 2014 in order to replace the older warships from the Cold War, but due to the failure of systems and fast-growing costs will not be delivered until at least next year, local media reported.
The surrender of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, leading ships of the new class frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now transferred to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is affected by worrying issues after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg class ships scheduled in 2007 will replace the ageing class of Bremen class frigate.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a type of anti-aircraft and anti-laden missiles, and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance gaps – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the domestic port for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that the top warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to influence the overseas as well, will become obsolete by the time of application, states Officer Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the yard after delivery.
The reasons for the recovery are known only a little, and the German articles have provided a number of key "programme and technical shortcomings", which would make the warship useless if it were sent to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce in the old Bremen class frigates.
It also proved to be very difficult for the ship, reducing its capacity and limiting the Navy's potential for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project has become a problem – including crew training.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) of the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "a lack of ships suitable for posting".
The official said that the issue has been tightened over time because the old ships have been decommissioned and replacement vessels have not been provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuertemberg-class ship could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats.
A new survey is being carried out on the site in Scotland, which seeks to discover how bats use food in the hunt for food.
They hope to re-light the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, National Fund for Scotland (NTS) scientists will monitor small bats and small bats and brown arrests of bats and bypass bats on Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
In key locations of the estate, special recorders will be placed to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what types of what they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, a NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitats are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK has dropped significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risks are also wind turbines and lighting, but also flies and certain types of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Because of the late hunting habits, hunting helps each other with their ears more than with their eyes.
In order to accurately determine errors and obstacles on the flight path, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking the bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspection of the shelters and occasional rescues.
The organisation has established even the first and only Scottish reserve in the Dumfries and Galloway region, specifically intended for bats, at the time.
The owner of David Thompson's estate says that the estate is ideal for them.
"We have an excellent bat area in Threav," he said.
»We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, the bats are still well known, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand better what we need to succeed."
It highlighted the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance works on possessions, since the possible inadvertent destruction of a single birth certificate of bats could lead to death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, so they are forbidden to be killed, harassed or disturbed, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish leader of the Fund for the Conservation of Bats, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply don't know how well their population behaves."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo marked rape charges that he was supposed to commit as "false news" and said that people wanted to "promot themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, who issued the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus accused him of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that she would then be paid $375,000 for her silence.
In response to 142 million followers in Instagram Live Video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, identified the reports as “false news”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," said the five-time gold ball winner in the camera.
»By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I wish everyone good," the player smiled, smilingly added.
Ronald's lawyers, according to the Reuters agency, are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges they called "an unacceptable reporting of the suspicions of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “non-equity damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was supposed to occur in June 2009 in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In a dossier filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at the Mayorg Night Club with Ronald, she was to return to the acting room, and she was to be raped anally there.
Majora argues that after that event Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a "99% good man" who was disappointed only in "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed his sexual relationship but described him as agreeable.
Majora also claims that she was headed to the police and that the hospital had taken photographs of her injuries, and later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “a terrible fear of revenge” and was concerned by “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that she wishes to cancel the settlement because of the alleged event, she continues to have severe trauma.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was just before the move from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, under an agreement worth $100 million, moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom "would forever regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "deploy forever" if after the peach had lost the status of the world's leading car manufacturer, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told BBC that the UK's exit from the EU would, without agreement, suspend production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal”, said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border in the case of brexite could lead, without agreement, to loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures the Toyota model Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that if Great Britain got out of the European Union at the end of March without agreement, production in our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s management director at Burnaston.
The concern about how the European Union exit will affect cross-border trade without agreement has also been expressed by other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brexite.
Toyota’s production line is operated according to the principle of “in the right time”, with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU coming every 37 minutes for cars.
If the United Kingdom came out of the EU on 29 March without agreement, this could cause disturbances at the borders, which representatives of the industry say could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota could not have stored more than a day of parts in its Derbyshire factory, representatives of the company said, so production would have stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "excessively moderate to avoid such border checks".
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity”, he told Today's BBC Radio 4.
"Data not only Toyota, but also other producers are that we must absolutely be able to continue a highly successful supply chain set."
In the long term, Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been suspended, and it pointed out that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Union Unit in the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience never restores the lost job."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be relocated, says the White House.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could lead to the ongoing fight against Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate "recast for another week", the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election interference, links between Trump's colleagues and Russia and the potential president's obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Attorney General and endanger Mueller's independence has been powering Washington's rumours for months.
In the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing the use of a listening device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of a report of his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting was held with Trump at the United Nations Conference in New York on Thursday.
Trump said that "I would rather not forgive" Rosenstein, and the meeting was then postponed in order to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the Senate.
Trump's press rep, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not yet set for him. It could happen this week, depending on everything else that goes on in the Supreme Court, we could postpone it for another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed.«
Some of the rapporteurs would object, and Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's host asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of the meetings was not attributable to the resistance to the “posting” of TV reporters, but she said: “I could not deny that they are being put up.”
She then mentioned that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president performs more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without a source: “We have looked at the numbers.”
The meetings will still be held," Sanders said. "If the press at the President of the United States can address the issue directly, it is endlessly better than discussing it with me.
We are trying to make this possible, and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at your disposal where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guest statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York City, the president may have shown why, when he appeared freely and partially bizarrely in front of the collected journalists.
A letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland on the fear related to brexite
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation for the country and the desire to continue their work after the peach.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying applications for the regulation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the exit, when the decisions were taken approached this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated the preparation of the possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for you all.
I would therefore like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff regardless of his nationality.
Co-workers from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities we supply.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
A line supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, after a head injury in Saturday's defeat at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported by Mike Authority from the newspaper The Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got to the edge of the playground and sort of collapsed there,” said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie on the edge of the playground with oxygen before they put him on a stretcher and carried him off the field for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the details of the type/range of injury are not yet known” and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five blows together before he left the game, which raised his total number of punches in the season to 18 blows.
A higher tax will be charged to foreign buyers when they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when they purchase property in the UK and additional money will be used to help homeless people under new plans
The move will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increased amount will be charged by those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The foundation expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, and it will target them for help to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of quantity when they purchase property in the UK and the money raised will be spent on the homeless, today will be reported by Theresa May.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure affordable housing and greater taxation of people with high incomes.
The increased amount will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and additional money will boost the government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The amount — charged in addition to the current amount, including increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estates, could be zero less than three per cent.
The foundation expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-Staters of the United Kingdom would buy 13 percent of the newly built London property, resulting in higher prices and harder purchases of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "ghost places", as the number of buyers who spend most of the time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the quantity to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The major construction companies have accused price hikes with land grabs, which are not actually used, and Mrs. Mayevo has called on Mrs. Mayevo to drop quotas for affordable housing in order to correct Britain's "inhabitation shame".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the completion of forced emigration without errors.
In addition, it wishes to grant the city councils greater powers for the construction of new homes.
Mrs. Mayeva said: “I said last year that I would dedicate my Prime Ministerial Leadership to the restoration of British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means correcting our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
But it can't be right for people who don't live in the UK and for foreign companies, buying home is as easy as for the British citizens of Garac.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is getting too far away and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
Sunderland chief, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" was once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the North East Club, which currently holds a third seat in the First League, with three points less than the first.
He moved to Light Stadium this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scotland Championship in the last season.
»I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I received the B cap and that's what it was," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound show.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered if you were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletics team, who had previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town, says that he had no fear as an heir to such great names.
“A success for me is measured by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’.
According to the structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The way to there is not easy, but I would probably consider myself successful only if the club could lead there again."
Ross only does the manager's job three years after his assistant leader in Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent the fall into the third league, and St Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a true turning point,” recalled Alloe’s takeover.
"I was truly convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny, because I was doing well as an actor, and I had a relatively good time and achieved certain greater successes.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a number of things to face every week.
This is what I still face in the sense of stress and pressure at work, but management just feels like the right thing to do for myself.
I always wanted to run a club and now I do it. In my whole adult life, I feel the most comfortable.”

Research: The ideal time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturday
The summer heat increased the revenues of the hard-working British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurant chains also increased.
The groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who prepared the data, said: “The continued solar time and participation of England in the world cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern in June in the last month, when pubs’ income increased by 2.8%, except that restaurants were affected even more.
The fall of traffic in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased further in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased more compared to that seen in restaurants.
Sun weather also reduced sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, but not as dramaticly as with restaurant managers.
It seems people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over one month and the sale of food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman from the group of leisure analysts and hospitality RSM said: “These results continue to continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
For sale in the hospitality market, the greatest factors remain the weather and impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall by 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful at annual level due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of food bars, the long hot summer could not have come at a more wrong time and only time will tell whether the need for recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the measure of sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is an established industrial reference.
One in five children has on a social network a secret account that they hide from their parents
The study showed that one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account on a social network hidden from parents and teachers
The survey among 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News has strengthened fears of sex-related publication
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account for parents
One of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates an account in front of their parents on social networks.
The survey among 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has strengthened fears of publishing the sex related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage the censored "primary" account that they show their parents, as well as have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that the daughter had been asked to rape her.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and half of them admit that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are subject to temptation and create a website where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" at the Scotland Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletics Committee as the Executive Director of the Annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle described this move as the most decorated Scottish athletes on the ground and outdoors and President Ian Beattie described it as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community. We are sure that the athletics in Scotland would gain a great deal from its inclusion in the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who of the four Olympic medals won in the 200m and 400m in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, remained speechless after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only take time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
Work was hard, but I was fully recovered, learning to walk again, and I am doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!«
An ad for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows has divided online opinions
The company that manufactures breast pumps has shared views with an ad comparing mothers to cows in milk.
In the opening of the marketing of the first silent chest pump, Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show the mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a hay-filled barn, in a song that includes the following words: “Yes, I draw, there is no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my sister’s, these are my tits.”
The collection continues: "Dry, drain, feed the babies, drain, drain, squeeze the breasts."
However, the ad published on the Facebook website has led to considerable dissent online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many said it was a joke on the account of the "ugly" dairy industry.
»The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and they get pregnant to produce milk, but the babies are stolen from them in the first days after they're up," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?«
Someone else said, "Advert completely unfeeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song "for a dead man was funny".
»This seems like a genius idea.
I'd buy one, too, if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was drawing.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it, just like it was meant to be.
This is a genius product," wrote the second one.
Someone commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who deplete their milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows."
This is not an ad to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, does not have any wires or tubes and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the child and even exercise outdoors during milk extraction.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD, commented on her mother. "Elvie's drawing is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a bold and provocative presentation."
By drawing a parallel between milk-drinking women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the pumping of milk and all its challenges, and in a fun way that women can connect with, we wanted to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
That's not the first case when Elvie's gas station came to the front page.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the model track took a walk for the designer Martha Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly relocated to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen greatly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration made it difficult for the child to surrender to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid that the child’s application would endanger their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of the households would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenze, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had asked for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are sponsors or domestic sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punishable foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to address children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month after being detained and not after 60 days, which was a previous standard, workers at the shelter said.
Many will show up with a video-conference call, not personal to defend themselves against the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to statements by workers in shelters and reports in the system in recent months.
The advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, e.g. tonilla, where the signs of the child’s distress due to their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children to a tent city without being emotionally prepared or given a chance to say goodbye to friends could complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupancy forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home even if there has been a war in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who also performs the duties of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they will “be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem said that "war against terrorism" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, "almost finished".
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we had cleared the Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and of any illegal foreign presence.
The United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are primarily training and counseling Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and accused “some Western states” of “expansing unreasonable fears” which convinced the refugees to stay abroad.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They change into a political issue, which should be exclusively a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive reconstruction until Assad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and hoped that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fronta nusra fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who would be "rooted".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Missouri, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to prepare a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be "limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Reach a Second Mandate
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency will soon end with an intervention and a scandal.
Which would be without a doubt "the most dramatic final of the presidency ever!"
So far, there's no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of maximum viewing and MSNBC’s view has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers during its highest ratings, which is more than four years ago when it was 1.7 million years ago, the "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast on MSNBC's channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night important news.
“It is a fire that attracts people because it is something that we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, the director of the play “Designated solution”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned song comedy and bookwriter »Only funny parts: and some hard truths about snooping in the Club of Hollywood Boys« offers a different explanation.
He remembers driving with a cab in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Mrs. Scovell told me.
In chaos, it's a fun value.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, the Washington story could decide the future of Roe v. Wado, given whether immigrant families can reunite and health in the global economy.
Turnoff is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, six hours of watching a round table of experts discussing the use of the source "from the deep background" for the book "Fears" by Bob Woodward, 15,000 USD worth of jackets from an Noah's leather ("a.k.a. a dress that is thickly bloated with a breath," said the daily The Washington Post) and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trump, Khm, Anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria the same thing again.
“Part of his work that impresses the reality of the show is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" on the capture of Trump's show and daily turn of scripts (the match with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to play an episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees (26.7 °C) of Kauai outside his home on the north coast of Kauai (26.7 °C), but he was lost inside watching MSNBC when CNN was recording.
There was no way to tear it off, even when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
“I recall that at that time we were creating all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money is being prepared for the most tight mid-term elections
It is not surprising that there is a flood of money in the 17th Pennsylvania district, as two candidates were in the same seat due to the redecoration of congress districts.
This recently divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is the home of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The cards were re-enacted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge in January ruled that the old districts were anti-constitutional in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district touched on the fight to finance the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
He was the first to become a member of the World War II Police Department in the United States of America.
This seat has been occupied by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States, sanctions against Salvador were considered for China's support and then withdrawn.
The graduates found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with few objections from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting in June 2017 with President Panama Juan Carlos Varello and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the US diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in turn to "a recent decision to end the recognition of Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the Ministry representative, said in a statement at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered on Salvador, which is estimated to receive USD 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the restriction on financial assistance and the targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would be greatly affected by this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, the top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, ending their reflection on the penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the participants of the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the US government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three US envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them subject to anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government who also spoke about it subject to anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next awkward news could be Robert Mueller's special adviser's report on possible obstruction of the judicial authority, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was also expected to point the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign had been involved with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the congress changes his hands, Mr Trump will have to answer at the moment he prepares to speak to his constituents again even before a jury of his colleagues.
There are a lot of questions here, and I do not want to claim that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, and neither is his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight can take.
In 1938, German officials were willing to strike Hitler if the West were to resist him and in Munich supported Czechoslovakia.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the flight of worship that followed.
On such turning points, the flow of history is changing, and it is speeding up or blocking the impregnable march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with several such turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man with the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a hurry since this officer reported that he proposed a covert recording of the president last year and speculated on his incompetence for the situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of Officer The Times was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the requested investigation by the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or will be appointed as the Supreme Judge despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that will call for Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, we have a long winter democracy ahead of us.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she told me to light the shabat candles on the swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, making it clear that they will win over the Austrians after an impressive remission against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month put them in a convincing position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season at 2:2 p.m. against Villarreal, but thought that the Rangers could use this as a bounce for major achievements.
“This was a well-deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said 31-year-old.
“We entered into the game in the belief that we could achieve something and take the point away.
We may be able to win at the end of the game, but in general the rummy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am confident with the crowd for us that we can work hard and achieve a positive result.
The last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I feel good about this place now.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it; training is good.
I hope that we can now continue, leave the final season behind and achieve success."
A Poor Sleep of Women Over Fear of Savings
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talk about this with their family members.
Half of the respondents in the Nationalwide insurance research said they were talking to spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to children.
“People want family members to care about them, but do not try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance sector at the Nationwide Insurance Company.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare families for you if you do not talk about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive the care, as this may be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Involve the financial advisor: Your financial consultant can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance by your own means, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health professional by determining a trustworthy person who will oversee your healthcare and ensure that experts take into account your health desires if you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, the authority of a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid unless you are able to do so yourself.
Remember: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a massive earthquake and tsunami, which on Friday hit the Indonesian city of Pala, officials said and the number of victims was expected to increase further.
In the event of broken communications, rescuers from the Donggall Regent, areas north of Palu, closer to the Earthquake epicenter of Magnitude 7.5, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key data on Palu and Donggali on Sulavezia:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavezi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavezia and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a province that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulavezi.
Regency, an administrative unit under the province, was estimated to have 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulaveza are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province there is also an important activity of nickel mining, but mostly in Moravio, on the opposite side of Sulavezia.
According to reports from the Indonesian Agency for Failing the effects of natural disasters over the last 100 years, Pal and Donggalo have been affected several times by tsunamis.
In 1938, tsunamis caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggali.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck northern Donggalo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake-active Pacific fire ring, and earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
The large earthquake on the western coast of the Ionia Province of Aceh on the northern Sumatra on December 26th caused the tsunamis that hit 14 countries, which killed 226,000 people along the coast of India’s estimate, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: The type of severe earthquakes struck western Sumatro late March and early April.
A hundred people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of Magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered the tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of Magnitude 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital of the city of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of Magnitude 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: The flood struck the Regent of Pia Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami didn't go off, but down buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and suspended thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's oldest son for domestic violence
The tape Palin, the oldest son of the former governor and vice president's candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone out of hand.
Palina has been detained at the Precazen Institute of Mat-Su and is in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was “surely innocent” when he was asked about the defence, the network reported.
Palina has been charged with three class A violations, which means they could have shut him down for up to a year and fined $25,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence punishable by a single day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
Palin's crime wasn't charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference with domestic violence and possession of weapons in alcoholised condition in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups when she linked her son's violent behaviour to a post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from the military service in Iraq.
Indonesian tsunami earthquake: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
It was the earthquake of the 5th Magnitude that set off the tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are cut off and the number of deaths is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulavezi, which lies north-east of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Social media has video clips showing the moment of the earthquake.
When tsunamis hit the coast, hundreds of people held back at the beach festival in Palau.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for terrorist suspects in New York City
The U.S. Attorneys in New York are demanding the death penalty for Syful Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a delivery truck to carry out an attack on a cyclist road along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan when he hit more pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, it is stated in a notice of the death penalty requirement lodged in the Southern district of New York.
According to the case-law, the cause of the death penalty may be either of the charges.
A few weeks after the attack, the Grand Federal Jury of Saipov informed the indictment at 22 points, which included eight counts of murder in aid of blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and intent", said the prosecutors, who described Sai's way as "consequential, cruel and defiant."
“Sayfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuccoa,” notes the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of the South District imposed the final death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers and finally turned in September 2009 into a life sentence.
In the city of New York, the death penalty was last pronounced in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed by a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
After the indictment, Saip's office told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS video that he saw on his phone.
The police also said that he requested the release of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On 22 counts, he pleaded guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of taking the plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all those involved will only extend the suffering of these events," Patton said.
Sai's defense group had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
We should be in charge of the negotiations on the peaches of NIGEL FARAGEA, a real torian MEP
During today's protest at the Torian conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the human army".
The former leader of Ukipa said that politicians should feel the heat of Eurosceptics when one of the MEPs in Therese May proposed that she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
On the march in Birmingham, conservative Commissioner Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would “be out now” if Mr. Farage had been secretary of the peach.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mayeva in coordinating her deeply divided species was also highlighted by the Torians who favored the resignation of the peach who joined a separate protest against the city's peach.
The prime minister seeks to maintain his plan in the run during the attacks of the advocates of brexite, the opponents of brexite and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "cassa".
Mr. Bone at the Leave Mens Leave Convention (Department means departure) in Solihul that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that Mr Farage should be appointed as his spokesman and be given responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
This MEP from Wellingborough added: "I'll support the peach, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: "In the world wars, we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that since the vote in 2016 the public opinion has changed: "The thought of the British having changed their mind and wanting to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
At the meeting there was also the Torian Brexist Andrea Jenkins, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘The Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unloved by our client and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election at all.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message intended for Mrs. Mayove, she added: "The prime ministers keep their job when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that the politicians should be given a "feeling hot" when they intend to issue a decision taken at the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue a peach, and today we're gathered here to say to them, "We won't let you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to give our political class, which is on the edge of the issue of brexite, a feeling of heat."
"We mobilize the human army of this country, which has given us victory in the brexite, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the leftovers walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour meeting at the city center.
A handful of activists waved their flags against the peaches after the group was established this weekend.
Laburistic nobleman Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security difficulties of using the client's application after opening the conference.
"These are people who are telling us that they can establish IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus Plus Agreement, for the free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good peach," he added.
Warren's potential challenge for president's position will be "expected closely"
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "participating in the race for the presidency will study closely" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe daily reported that the Massachusetts Democratic girl spoke about her future at a meeting with the citizens of West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of the Trump election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of "town hall" since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to become president.
Warren replied that it was time to "slow women in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of LSU Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that on Friday she arrested a suspect in the shooting of a basketball player named LSU Wayda Sims.
A police station in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of a 20-year-old Simpson at an 11-hour press conference.
They released a video clip of the shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on the tape.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot to the head and died as a result,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul, the 247s network.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter cub who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last season with 10 beginnings, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 match jumps.
The Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion and the team ordered him to let Sebastian Vettl win
On Saturday, the moment Walteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that "the Mercedes team would have a major impact on the race".
Bottas began well at the start and almost left Hamilton dry when defending his position in the first two turns and invited Vettl to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him into boxing later and left him behind at Vettlo, but after some driving action, Hamilton noticed that Ferrari's driver was leaving the inward side open and risk being left behind after two moves to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last type of network and until the end of the first round was on his 21st birthday in seventh place.
Afterwards, much of the race was driven without tire change, as he was about to perform a fast finish, beat Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
He finally took the boxing round 44, but in the remaining eight laps he couldn't increase his speed, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Walteri's been driving fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team did an extraordinary job to reach first and second," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad physical rumor.
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein for her insistence not to reveal a letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony to the Senate investigation committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and liars".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and lying,” he said.
"When you look at the posts and the disclosures, people say, "No, I didn't do it."
I did not do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it.’
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... No, we did not," he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford's letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July and the media was disclosed in early September – but Feinstein's refusal to come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose her letter,” said Officer The Hill Feinstein’s report to the Commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential as she asked."
Her denial evidently did not fit the president, who said at his meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, this was a really bad talk of the body.
It may not be true, but it was the worst word of the body that I have ever seen."
In the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the President suggested that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power by all means.
You've seen the evil, the disgustingness, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to run over to get their hands on to the power and control," according to a mediate website report, the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars redeemed themselves for their loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's Dundee game at 5:3.
Giants were taken early for two goals on Patrick Dwyer's hits and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened the home page, and then Dwyer took the lead again for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened the Dundees before the two goals of Lundwald Nielsen gave them victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundees 2-1 on Friday nights from the background.
This was the fourth season of the team, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game at 3:35 p.m. at Kendall McFaull, Beauviller, who scored four minutes later, and gave David Rutherford.
In an intense introductory part, Sullivan once again took home the game, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowania an equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' vacation run when, at the end of the first third, he scored his second goal dinner.
The home side was reunited, and Bouchard made up for the backdrop with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped to lead the Dundees ahead at the end of the second third and to take care of the fifth goal of their half-time team and to take care of the fifth goal of their team at the end of the third half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game at home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller, with his death, allowed hundreds of people on board the plane to escape from the earthquake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are celebrating as a hero after sacrificing his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed in the rest of the earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, followed by the tsunamis, and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by powerful earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
Although the associates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in a highly yawning control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufre Airport Pala Airport.
It remained in it that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could have taken off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was breaking down.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“Our hearts break when we hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the Agency for the Reduction of Accidents in the State said that access to cities in Donggala, Sigia and Boutong was limited.
“The number of dead is expected to increase further, as there were a number of bodies under the ruins, and many could not achieve it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative.
The pala, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six feet [6 m] high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings bodies.
We're running out of clean water.
Minimarkets are mined everywhere.«
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Pal and spoke to the national army: "All of you, please work night and day to fulfill all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" After CNN reports.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini Airport crash: Air Niugini Air Company now says that after the plane crashes in the lagoon, one man is missing one man
The airline, which managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing them after they initially announced that they had evacuated all 47 passengers and crews safely from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
They told the airline that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing one.
The call for more information on a passenger such as his age or nationality did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit by the water when it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said they had taken seven people to the hospital.
The airline said that there were eight passengers at the hospital on Saturday who were all in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just before the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
“This is extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers managed to get through to the water line to the emergency exits on the diving plane.
He said the stewardesses started panicking and shouting, and himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were near to repairing the pier also came to the aid. In rescue, they helped themselves using an inflatable boat that carried people to the mainland before the plane sank into about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in air accidents in the last two decades in Papua-New Guinea, but this is the first accident to take place with Air Niugini.
Analyst set the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississipian woman alive in 2014.
A U.S. Justice Department analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, reported Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' place at the time when he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "lying, because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The cell phone records show you two only met for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, he erased Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” said Hale.
The defence is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury was due to be judged later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
Hiphop Trio wants to produce a negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed group in Bristol claims that hiphop has strayed from its original political and social engagement.
They want to return to its roots and remake a conscious hip hop popular.
Artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently experienced a resurrection with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
The New York nanny is suing the couple for firing them because of the "racist" message
The New York nanny sues for being discriminatoryly fired after receiving the wrong message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black woman. ”
The couple denys the growth treatment and the lawsuit is compared to "rape".
In 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment with the arrival of the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who found that she was black.
“NEEEEEE EIE another black,” Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to my husband, Mrs Maurice sent it twice.
Following the conclusion of her slip, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "favourful", fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, an African-American, had been doing a bad job and wanted to hire Filipinka, was reported by New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now asking the court for compensation of 350 USD per day for a period of six months for the performance of the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, these things are not done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her.
"The wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not a racist,” said the man Joel Plasco about Post.
“ Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to even if it had happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
In comparison with the action against "immigration", Plasco said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You're going to take it out on someone like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although proceedings are still under way before the court, the court has condemned the public opinion of a couple on social networks because of its behaviour and way of thinking.
Publishers of Paddington Bear Stories feared that readers would not be associated with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It was hard to put herself in the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an amazing success."
She said that her father, who at first worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a book about a small bear toy, would be bitter at the time of refusal of his work, added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book was "Greek-Sweet".
Regarding Paddington's bear, which she described as "a very important member of our family", she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man who did not like to brag,” she said.
»But since Paddington's bear was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You're proud of him even if you don't really do it yourself.
I think Paddington's bear's success was viewed in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington the bear himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors sought to preserve her life for nothing.
“Hope regularly called to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperuse.
“Then I got Nad’s call. He told me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping were slowly conceivable and abandoned.
She was dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position where my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to endure."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who has now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, not aware of the trials she is experiencing.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had a head down and I had tears in my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Hope on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving female lepits posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one because of suicide try to turn others away to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are on a valid bridge crying with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he got depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want to feel like I do every day for any parent," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was promising a chef with a communicable smile.
"Everyone knew him after his smile.
They always said that his smile enlightened every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a real dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to even if it's a friend.
Do not sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies's for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
»A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behaviour.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to process it: "She cut a hole in the whole family.
She's torn us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of an FBI air investigation.
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, it might unify us,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world might be threatened by a solid party failure.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, are only five weeks – if, as expected, Republicans are cut off poorly, they will be greatly weakened in trying to elect a wanted man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly phoned the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, who was presented to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Chamber, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate could gather at least 50 votes, which would bring Mike Pence, vice president, a breakthrough from the stalemate and the election to the Supreme Court.
North Korean fugitives decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean MEP.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said that 1127 people fled last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and the price increases required by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not commented on this in public yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South — which are technically still at war — have improved significantly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled negotiations on de-nuclearisation.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the US sanctions to a standstill since then.
“There will be no confidence from the United States in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,” said Mr. Ri, in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh "The Hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives named Brett Kavanaugh as “the hysterical” as the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh and said that he was typically inappropriate for the service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosieva said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of any other than that if a woman were to act that way, she would be called “hysterical”,” she commented on the Kavanaugh’s Thursday testimony before the Senate investigation committee.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied the accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, he almost cried out occasionally, and he choked on his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and the accusations against him as "grossy and coordinated mudning", organised by the liberals, angry at the loss of Hillary Clinton in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosieva said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she should not be appointed the Supreme Judge, as it showed that she was partial to the Democrats.
“I think that through such statements and the way he went about Clinton and Democrats, he discredited himself,” she said.
Pelosieva is asked whether Kavanaugh will try to file a constitutional indictment if it is confirmed and the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
“I will say so – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a Federal Court of Appeal judge in Washington.
Pelosieva said that she was concerned as a democratic woman about the possible decision of Kavanaugh against the Law on Available Health Care or the Roe case against Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided whether certain decisions by the Supreme Court would be repealed.
“Now is not the time to go hysterical, biased person to court and expect us to say ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
And a woman's got to get him.
It is a just waste, after months and years of anger, and cannot express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs Stein told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem rare to me, do you?"
She continued: “It was very helpful for me to have a woman who was a director somewhere who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which was when she became angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said, ‘Maybe I feel sad because I cry.
I am angry.’
Then she just kept going.
I thought it was a great idea."
Tears are partly allowed as a way out for anger because people misinterpret them.
One of my strongest memories from my early career, when I was still working in an office that was dominated by men, and I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, was an event when an older woman grabbed me by the neck — a cold leader who was always a little afraid, dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They will not understand that you are angry.
They will think you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have touched you."
Patricia Schroeder, the former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping across a raft in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply depressed and found that there was no reason why she could not run for president herself.
“It was not a well thought out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates involved in the race, and one was the last needed thing at the time.
Someone then called the match “Snowling and Seven Thumbs”.
Since the campaign was the last to join, it was lagging behind in fundraising and decided not to enter the game unless it collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only given her $250.
“Do they think I’m going to get a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude for the people who supported her — dissatisfaction with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates and anger because of sexism — were so overcome that she began to choke.
“I would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder remembered the reaction of the media.
“I would have thought he was my official sponsor of Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my gravestone.
“Was she crying?””
How the U.S.-China War could benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle has not been completed long ago, experts say that it could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been retaliated each time with equivalent reimbursement measures, with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent per cent per US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving an eye for an eye with the United States and is likely not yet to blink.
In order to be able to give in to Washington, China should agree to his demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Si Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing is able to pull the right moves, US pressures in the trade war in the long term could have a positive impact on China in order to reduce the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional associate who focuses on Asia in the brain trust of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in the restoration of a country devastated in over seven years of war.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the restoration of the desolated state.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup for 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil in a row and has not won Ryder's Cup since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championships, ran the ball into the French Molinari at a 16th hole in a couple or three at his initial blow.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all circles and became one of four players who ever since the beginning of the championship in the current form in 1979 achieved a score of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost to Ian Poulter in England, who may have played the last time in Ryder's Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder's cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became Europe's most winning player at the World Cup with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the Cup again.
It is a team and I am really glad that I can help," Garcia said emotionally after European victory.
The staff is handing over to their cousin John Ram, who on Sundays with two and one in individual games beat the American legend of golfing Tiger Woods.
“I feel incredibly proud to have managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France to play them, and now he has a career record in Ryder's Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 big titles, right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked so hard all week to find the right path, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all the time.
After a bad performance, the American captain said: "I am so proud of these boys, they fought."
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe for a moment.
We failed.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, and I'm gonna cooperate with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Cap down.
We were outplayed.«
