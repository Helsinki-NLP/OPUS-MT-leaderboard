I'll come to your house.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.

Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.

Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even think they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so everyone can hear you.
I've got a tickle.
From now on, I'm going to study in French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was terribly cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated from American literature in college.

We were out of our minds.
I think you'll be pleased.

If you need anything, just give me a call.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.

She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, and I was wondering if my email had ever gotten to you.
She had her hair in front of the mirror.

I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he ate something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
You're fine with the green one.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the beach.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on one of his jeans.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She's convinced her son is still alive.

You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snorkeling.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, that's too bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good with everyone.

What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles an hour.

Many traders were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom is lower than the average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful shirt.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Tom that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.

I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.

That kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to study French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's against it.
What is the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'll make sure of it for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have an appointment with him at noon.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?

These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.

Sometimes we meet them.

The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twin brothers look exactly alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the smile.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have some very bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you're right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted an invitation to visit Mary's party.
You won't be the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm angry at myself.
This was done by hand tom.
You won't believe the kind of stuff people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much luggage when you travel.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage to the others.
I got you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me in public.
The light bulb's on fire.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I took at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all agreed that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a nightbird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do what you want; but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think I'll learn to swim on vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me get so mad.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken, jump over the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right by the beach, there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.

Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
Chat-time I'm thinking about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have obeyed their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was so stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom is hard to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so high, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's not feeling well.
Did Spot go, too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a raincoat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study in the library together?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in effect.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I need to go out for a minute.
You're fine with the green one.
Fingers crossed.

Can I see that one?
My uncle gave me that watch.
Real friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom studies French every day.
In this store, they do kitchen work.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Do any of your crew speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen one like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never climbed the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat a live frog every morning and for the rest of the day nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
Last night I couldn't blink.
Russia is losing 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you have to get French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're studying French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke's getting too far.

I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter became a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he's writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my checkbook.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes have been untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took his coat off.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
It's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to have lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something with you personally.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.

How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.

Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?

I haven't really fed myself yet.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up there and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball at the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at his hotel.
You like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
Get off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's still no mention of Tom.
Hand it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm looking for something not that expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak English than in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time I'll make more efforts.
I've already done my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
There's a little left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I've got three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if there was any pen he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We were running out after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great!
I don't like this.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
I'm asking Tom.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with this.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
That's what his ignorance is all about.
You're absolutely right.
Everybody knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We're gonna throw him a farewell party.
What club do you join?
Atushi may have been ill.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over.
We're working together now.
Go back to your post.
He graduated Cambridge with a medal.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom study French at school?
What shoes are they?
We certainly did our best.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You don't know half of it.

The film was made of polyethylene.
I've decided on a task of ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How long does a cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastically began his worthy endeavor.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
Be more specific.
I'm off this week.
I wash my socks.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I have no doubt about his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching the game?
This is your home.
The losses were severe for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time for them to leave.
She puts on makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?

Don't make my eyes look good.
I don't have any money.
Millie's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went out shopping.
That cake's nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are now demode.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
It's finally stopped raining and the weather's warmed up.
She made not particularly light hints about what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where'd you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some of the poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What is the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't go the way you walk around, you start calling people names.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got caught up in traffic, and I couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been wasted for a long time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you "stupid."
I want to speak in French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you're failing, is worth more than an hour of praise when you've succeeded.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was done.
His shirt was covered in sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made an Anne doll.
What'd you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
It's a very interesting story for me.
I've read this book.
It's been a good year for you.
It was cleaned up.
I can't do this.

I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he has cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Put your hand up.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
There's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the reward fifty-fifty.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom threw a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting was going to be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began to return home.
I have a problem. I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She's reached a mature age.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared, don't worry.
Yesterday was fun watching TV.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees whose leaves contain silk bugs.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got some news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
My joints hurt.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?

The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you give me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend to their disease.
I wouldn't think tofu would taste so good.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I still don't have the change of heart.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I've got a pus from the wreaths.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends, and eventually everyone will know.
She was cold.
Tom speaks a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the fair.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see it carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
It's the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
There's good food in this restaurant.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my spot.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment makes it.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
That's a great poem.
Prices have been down lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the transmission, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to carry Tom across the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat by the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I've found something better.
There used to be a lot of frogs in that pond.
I understand it wonderfully.
Depends on the context.
Has anything changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry, you won't fix anything.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him come down the stairs.
A friend of mine is coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope that happens.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You drive too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll love it!
I'm afraid I hurt you.
I have nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's deprived of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put on those slippers, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to leave.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll be studying French next semester.

I'll see you tonight.
I'm out of money.

Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children must obey their parents.
Are there errors in this exercise?
Can you come on Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
Nobody answered the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning Esperanto.
The new bike costs me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it until later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so shallow.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom looks objective.
The tunnel failed because of the earthquake from the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What have you been doing all this time?
My uncle never wrote letters.
Shut the damn door!
We made fun of him for that.
John came in a week ago.
He refused the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The barber is a man who shaves the beards and cuts the hairs of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is this yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom liked to sing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't get on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not being mean.
I'm just an office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be there in time.
He often walks to school.
The socks stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're tough.
How many Van Pice episodes have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're both sweet, and sweet.
My sister lives next door to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
My intention wasn't like that.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her T-shirt.
Hey, man, I'm begging you, spray some insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after, it started to rain.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
Permissions are not required.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says good-bye and wishes me a good night.
Let's check it out.
You've done a good job so far.
I cooked dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard to concentrate today.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him.
I have a job for Tom.
Where'd you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher was late for class.
Let me make this clear what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I film you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried it that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this bathroom.
You're on a winning streak.
I want a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be disturbed.
I don't think Tom's number is in the manual.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you so much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's having dinner with her.
These containers are closing hermetically.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's no one here.
I want more detailed information.
Do you carry a gun?
He says he avoided danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm coming out.
Isn't that surprising?
He makes friends with everyone he meets.
You need to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand it.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was shaking with fear.
I was your mother's first friend.

I'm used to this.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Whose are these socks?" "My sister's."
I think you should call Tom.

When was the last time you went to the beach?
We were worried sick about you.
He can't read.

I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and to remember new words.
I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team had red shirts.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say cheese.
Tom's not gonna get paid.

It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave his card to Mary.

We pushed the car.
What is the minimum wage in Germany?
We have something for you.
He had a hard time breathing.
I don't eat pork.
Coming here was a mistake.
The paper published a profile on its new editor.
It's been a failure since the beginning.

I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom may object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you'd better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to give their children a good education.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.

It wasn't my fault.
Read it one more time.

Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like to walk on the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
Did you have fun last night?
Well, to put it straight, he's wrong.
They're already here.

I'm bringing her back.

He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He married a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
It's something quite different.

He still wants to come.
We have to postpone the celebration.

I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.

See you.

That's what I'm looking for.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.

You're definitely not supposed to lick the floor.
Let's do it.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Sorry to interrupt.

Can I take a look at this?
My dad won't let me go to the movies alone.
Where's the nearest pharmacy?

I'd say, "Go!"
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
Don't throw anything away.

You're exactly what I imagined you to be.

He likes trains.
I like to walk at night.
She gave me a nice doll.
Don't worry about it.
I think you'll like this one.
I'm in pain.
Go back to bed.
I have three grown sons.
My girl doesn't know.
Most people seem to give up before they realize their options.

I told Tom everything about Mary.

Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I need to meet Tom.
Although Tom's English sometimes looks pretty good, he has no idea how far his options go, and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you and Tom fighting.
Will you respond?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the best friend of the man. Inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's not working.
My mother made a very nice sex.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some kind of community service?
Are you interested?
Apparently, Tom was famous before he released this album.
The Romans would have had no chance to conquer the world if they first had been required to learn Latin.
I paid 50 bucks.
Don't drink that.
I think we better get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you've always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clean the table now!
Mary is interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
Bees make honey.
Tom won't admit he doesn't know how to do it.
I'm the only one who knows them.
In this town, they've been getting iron for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Still collecting postage stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have a fever.
Has anyone told you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do this.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of person would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane waited, washed her back in the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.
Tom hasn't called me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good on you.
I studied French for three years.
I think you should get out now.
Please leave.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
I never heard Tom speak French before yesterday.
She's French.
Soldiers are used to dangers.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
Bon appÃ©tit!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We got here first.
Are you gonna make it?
The police found a body thrown off the coast not far from here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped in the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about that life of yours.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.
Languages like Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that thing to your parents.
Let's be honest!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land belongs to Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Do not add annotations.
He's still gone.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He plays well with the guitar.
Have you played Meincraft?
Nancy's scared of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medications right now?
The tree is on fire.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were just about to drive.
Can I take your coat?
My father will cook me a delicious feast tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just hung up the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept taking pictures.
Less and less teenagers are working today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's readable.
Shoichi's face faded.
Electric current can generate a magnetic field.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I have things to do tomorrow.
The tower was smashed into smoke and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Send her my regards.
Is your wife blonde, or is she a brunette?
I'm outside, riding my bike.
The men were taking the boy to the hospital.
They talked too fast to find out what they were saying.
Tom's down!
Are you sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given the opportunity.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
Don't give me a hard time.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
In the spring, the days are getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad singing in the bathroom.
Singapore speaks English.
I eat bread.
That request was denied.
You were right.
He was tired and still went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The light bulb's on fire.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I will always remember your kindness.
That smell, and I felt it another time.
Everybody dies.
I don't understand.
Give me the hammer.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a literary worm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do that.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice Japan.
Or you or them or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a little bit of a celebrity.
I love pizza very much.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as much fun as the book.
I wasn't pulled by the job.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole of us, a universe - part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be to get rid of this prison, extending the circle of our compassion so that we can embrace all living beings and nature throughout and beauty.
He's definitely coming.
I know him.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?
This local paper shall be published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three o'clock.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became a director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What is this thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I'm having trouble with French grammar.
I punched him in the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe this.
Do I have to open it all?
It's totally different now.
You're always late.
Let's move on.
The walls were painted in bright brown.
Betty killed him.
Have you started studying French yet?
You can't read in French, can you?
Your shirt looks really good with that skirt.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She's become famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you for "stupid."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that's making me nervous.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far away from here?
Bad weather didn't let me leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
I've had my feet sprayed.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and have a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to know, Tom, when he's planning on leaving.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants to get a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate that for?
If there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with your breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom was wondering where Mary spent her childhood.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom and Mary pulled out their guns.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Tom was sweating.
You'd better not go.
I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk in French.
I'd like a shirt that matches that jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your girlfriend.
You're always complaining.
The milk's gone sour.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your connection to him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was, I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I've got a few calls to make.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
My math is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom's back to pick up his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom came home covered in mud.
Have you actually tried?
Storm stopped the plane from taking off.
Tell me you have good news.
What browser do you use?
I remember what he said.
What is the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of a reader are you gonna get -- Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run away from every street.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith is being charged with a breach in the contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked to each other.
Are you sleepy, honey?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons normal, please.
I haven't been here much.
Take care of yourself.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on your robe.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
Yesterday was a terrible accident.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste any time.
Why did you come so early?
If she's judging by your great tan, it looks like you spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably snowing tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There used to be an art museum in this area.
I thought maybe your feelings had changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will be over.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really that hard to speak French?
When was the last time you took a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't ready by seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I heard about your party.
They need to change their attitude.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What is the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure out when the train's leaving.
You have to take French seriously.
I want to go there one more time.
It's such a stupid thing to say.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I'm pretending to be working.
She waits until the water boils down before making tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
They can't possibly come at this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months he would do so that we could all speak French without stopping.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And not a word to anyone about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon on the train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you sushi.
Let's do this for today.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Save the man, eat the cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awful.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom drinks water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me an envelope.
What am I afraid of, Tom?
You always sing.
I completely forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My dad was on his way out when the phone rang.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
The fog kept him from seeing far away.
Anne's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look carefully at the map of the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I'm out of shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
This is very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight down the road, and when you cross the skylight, you're there.
Do what you want.
Some people would definitely ask, why don't we just get our things together and get out of Afghanistan?
Wake up your socks, please.
I don't use ammo.
I'd like to get a picture of you.
Please, put him away.
"What kind of brand is your car?" "It's Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
His second cousin was a member of the Jewish board of directors.
Could you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy for me.
I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you made a mistake.
He didn't mind staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have an intolerance to travel by sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's a clue.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a leaf.
My uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put on his helmet.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The wide jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With little goodwill on both sides, our problems should be able to be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She climbed the stairs quickly.
The house we used to live in has been torn down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
The prices will continue to rise.
We study French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the skylight, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Did you ever congratulate PfirsichbÃ¤umchen in German?
It was an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this study.
Won't that be nice?
I don't know French, and I don't know Greek.
He let himself know he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I get so much sleep?
She answered through tears.
When are you leaving?
Hanako grew taller than her mother.
This is completely different.
The elephant is gray.
I'm studying French at home.
Don't make so much noise, please.
Have either of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married, and we want to get our heads fixed.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you going to eat that cookie?
I've been working hard for the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This may be a bit of a burden.
Looks like our water's coming to an end.
Take whatever you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something's been taken.
The green suits Alice.
The shit's coming together three times a week.
They caught the fox in a trap.
You're early.
You like kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They were late because of the storm.
I guess that won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
The effort is not only necessary, but also the pleasure.
We have to be careful.
It's already eleven.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You should use deodorant.
When I stand up to you people.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to go through with this.
You don't seem too surprised.
It's a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get some sakes.
Tell me a joke.
Tom's been practicing to speak French at all times.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People in general are against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom taught me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What's your tooth hurting?
We're studying French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We study French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about me.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is collecting postage stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than listen, two mouths and one ear would be given to us.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You wouldn't believe how popular Tom became.
Did you get it?
My dad often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Aren't you afraid of something?
You haven't known anything about him since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to deal with this now.
I got my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you haven't paid for the lack of consideration, please send the amount due and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is discussed.
Tom was rescued by an accidental passerby.
City Hall is downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
That's very kind of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of town that Mary lives in.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure that book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
Nobody could sleep tonight.
Round lasted about five minutes.
He was going around the country.
The sum of all the angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I have to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll sue you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs in?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, but what's left to say.
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that'll take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
Ever since he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flowering arrangements.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. How much Japanese food he's starting to like.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to stress that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Can you tell me about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to get an account.
I'm sure Tom knows French enough to get better.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary is Tom's big sister.
I don't know either guy.
Guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was so nice meeting you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the ladder.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruit rot under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the control.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It might take some time.
I thought you might back off.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What is he trying to achieve, Tom?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we better get out of here.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your mouth shut!
I would never hurt them.
I've studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's foggy today.
You live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he'd been gone for ten months.
Next week we move to Boston.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's get some rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You've got an infection on your gum.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I fucked you.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash in the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She blushed.
Do you have me for that stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make that decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Are you studying French?
You shouldn't give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eatin'?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of lines for DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the 20 students, only one had read the book.
I have a job on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Are we going out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy you used to date before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, it's embarrassing.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the taxi museum.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She sensed that her knees were shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't be with.
It'll be good if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My veins bleed every time I use a thread.
We got here fast because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He recently returned from France.
Molly has a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in a relationship with him in a long time.
Those glasses are good for you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
It doesn't eat until the perception is over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't work for me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the autumn.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
How long has Toim been studying French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
Looks like there are over two thousand sentences of Uygursky in Tataba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed that I did it.
Let's cross here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You thinking about going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care for the environment, the environment will destroy humanity.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't bring him in yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest drawback.
Press Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers rolled without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go welcome him and drop this letter in the meantime.
That hen hasn't laid any eggs lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung had no objection to me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
A lot of people are going to lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He came to me for help.
We're gonna start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's coming to an end.
The moment of glory for hanshin did not last long. They were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Won't that lead to trouble?
He's pissed off that he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
You really want to do this?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What are their findings?
We're here at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom might have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the sink on the kitchen window to get cold.
He's happy that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, that's too bad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth a ball into two halves.
It was personal.
Aren't you curious?
It's a great pleasure to see baseball games.
I think you better get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She had her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you throw them?
Tom, how does he plan to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera belongs to Tom, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Check that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not much fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We have to protect our children.
I'll see you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrasse and get off of Zeestrasse.
Laughter is good for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone's been telling me about.
Add this site to "Preferences".
When the sun of culture is low, even dwarfs cast a big shadow.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I won't give in to threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's helpful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's fine.
I go like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to submit the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone fry a turkey.
What's that river called?
Are you free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered in ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we need to agree.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket ticket?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need that.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little carried away while I was dancing, and I got on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into peacocks.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking down the rough road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind, you guys.
She took a test.
I'm going to study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on my exam.
This book isn't Tom's property.
Where have you been?
I've got to get him out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's already a grown man.
Let's not kid ourselves.
I've made up my mind.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you like that.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
You ever heard of him?
She washed her shirt in a hurry.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you wear different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had only one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
You can't read French, can you?
That's what I want.
Letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I don't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He came out from under the car.
He writes to his mother every once in a while.
Men get into shape, riding wheels.
This isn't the end of history yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you could recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom is alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just hold your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't use ammo.
You're my best friend.
I set up a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French verses?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to go with you.
She became twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That's a good one.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's running.
They long for the city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was running around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came here with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discussing it.
To eat sushi.
Throw those socks away, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say things like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out till late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take that, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this task?
I think you've had enough.
You told me that another time.
It's been six years since I started English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't know much about French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is wasting a lot of power.
Don't get attached to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made the man, then made the woman. Then, He had mercy on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi dances.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom is suffering from a flatfoot.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Man's stupidity is endless," I say, and because of this self-crity, I consider myself an exception.
The storm kept going, on the contrary, it was getting stronger and stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter to French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what you'd want, Tom?
The whole road is going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the way they were again.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth pulled out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't cover up how you feel about that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't go into the lock.
What is the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom, turn the light back on.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with so many bad gums, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They're headed straight for their target.
The boy came through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
The constant pays off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe Earth is being watched by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad walks in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't push me.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soft drink?
Many people share my view of the matter.
The shirt's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great endeavor at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be lit.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words alphabetically.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I can.
I'll hide in here.
She was taking care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl in the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, and I can't speak German.

I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.

Milk makes cheese and butter.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean that.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman bends a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you a damn thing!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom, start the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Burn 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
I'm French now.
Since I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm terribly busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a winning streak.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The distribution of television has deprive us of our time to read.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't look at my closet.
The new coronavirus is highly infected.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm off the record here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toasted necklace.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me very closely.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people can talk good, others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone coming in.
Tom went his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian too.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I never should have let you do this alone.
Sentenced to death.
I've only been waiting five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsch" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom got his knees cut.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40.
Do you have the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is back again.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the accident to the police.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I can hardly hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks a medium amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You've got your socks on backwards.
We just got word from Kansas concerning your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's this really about?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything in there?
They were all at work.
I ran out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not so much the disease knocked him down as the laziness did.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
Allah is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study at my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog is watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He watchs TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes until the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Coming here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so much.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
Tom won't know anything about it.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen supplies like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen a koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you're panicking.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
No less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My holiday plans have failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I've lost track of time.
He thought it might be a trick.
He's just the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anyone.
Tom took his knee off.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report it.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
He postponed the party.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How you doing, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Get the car back to the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do?
I saw his dad go for it.
Keep your room clean and neat.
I've had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I studied his face for signs of exhaustion.
Music is the common language of mankind.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be a pleasure to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in painting.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He often goes to the movies with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was terminated.
I'll be right there with you if you go there.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston he was staying in last year?
It's a complex problem.
It's 10:00 right now.
It's raining like a bucket.
Are you a bachelor, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We won't be here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like to play sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to find out.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest developments in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing that.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it off like a lost one.
I waited three days.
The material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to get a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't do that.
You're a good singer.
The cat eats.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention.
Speaking of travels, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educated his children well.
I was just being polite.
Tom's growing tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks shy.
This was made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm so sleepy.
Be more specific.
I was a vacation.
No one will know.
Tom goes out drinking every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put on his belt.
You think you're funny?
That's your decision.
Where's the library?
The boy shoved all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
You indebted yet?
Will you teach me French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
There's something I need to tell you first.
A cup of coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have any other choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family in front first, then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was a pale reminder of his father's appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't touch them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has alcohol problems?
Will anyone at the station meet me?
I haven't heard from him in months.
I don't play paint.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
That's a question I kind of understand.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the man who gave me this bike.
We will not fire under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom is a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Could you weigh that?
What's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have subordinates who speak French?
I'm not supposed to speak much in French.
Ask him about the way to the station.
He was going fishing in the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I give up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works at the wine shop.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow morning.
She makes me uncomfortable.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The staphides are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of possibilities.
We drove when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses, I might have left them on the train.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He played baseball after school.
The sound of that awful scream made him shake.
Do you have that shirt in black?
It wasn't a party.
Amy ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took my stuff off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's nothing to worry about.
We've got physical.
Did you have fun yesterday?
That sweater's worth over fifty bucks.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the shop.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Take your shirts off before they get wet.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I'm on Highway 58.
I think Tom's scared of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a big fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign stamps.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We got on a race in Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is a convenience.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I could barely handle the lighthouses.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom is very modest.
Thank you for that.
A ball of meat, Turkish panic, Mrs. Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school Tom intends to sign up for.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lot of big lotus leaves.
We firmly believe that when I make up sentences, the author should avoid subjecting to harmful habits that are present in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually completely out of the question in the light of the intended meaning.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move over," made your way and sat down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
It makes me sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
He suspects Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom's trying to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
Police searched the house and found two pounds of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to home?
Jane filed an application.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've done sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I like tennis.
Do you permit me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there are kids around.
He gets colder.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today, the train is ten minutes late.
There's been silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like it.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should talk in English.
She's getting better and better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an inquiry about the date of the test.
Maybe he's avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom is a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan practically every family has a laundry room.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The Raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I've had a lot of heads.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
He always said hello with a gift.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read quite well.
Tom's okay, right?
She looked up for a short time in the paper.
J.F. Kennedy is buried in a cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He's gonna make it to Hackodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to try.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very excited lately. My favorite football team is going down.
I was easy on the sweet talk.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language holder.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's light.
Tom got hurt.
His room's a mess.
They take part in their free time to care for the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's planning on going.
Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We postponed the departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater on under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum, it's in reconstruction right now.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming very fast.
Add this site to "Preferences".
I've got a lot to say on this one.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what's bothering you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
All the efforts of the doctor were in vain and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
He's a threat to us.
You want to buy this skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French, too.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They furnished the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been keeping my days in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
It's him, or I'm wrong.
You're French, aren't you?
The girl's used to playing by herself.
I play in one group.
The birds sang.
Tom finishes work at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
There will come a time when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get to the museum by bus?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be right.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: whose gold is, he sets the rules.
The house is inhabited by ghosts.
Tom's going into town.
Everything that's not forever is aged forever.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
You ever go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French quite well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated philosophy from my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the job to junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do that.
Whatever you're doing, you can't put a man to believe in anything, even less yourself.
I don't feel so good.
The air conditioner isn't working.
You're sitting in my seat.
Is there something that scares you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to study French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid 200 dollars in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you understand.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving in to this watch, not at all talking about breaking up with him definitively.
He didn't get the job.
I think you'll do just fine.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little while longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made sandwiches with an egg.
What did you see?
I bathe every morning in the summer.
Button up your shirt.
Read it one more time.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it to his speech in time.
I prefer grapefruits over oranges.
This place is worth visiting for once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just take it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I took your book, until I left it, I was constantly smiling, and one day I thought I'd start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's in a round.
I've seen that, too.
The dolphin is a species of mammal.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it could be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
In Mother's Day, I gave my mother 19 flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
The pocket calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed at school, no less than pencils and tires.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You shouldn't wait here.
And Tom, Mary covered her eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I borrow money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
It looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a headless chicken.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He put on his coat and walked out of the house.
Tataeba's new website will sail a home-made hyper-based database, built by a search engine, and go to a dad's ebux-OS server with a tadatel CPU made entirely by tatabius.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it a lot.
I never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Tom, can he come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about this.
I think you put too much sugar in it.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden have faded.
They made us work all day.
We've chosen him as president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His destiny is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, which one would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This kind is a threat.
I think you'd better go to bed.
I like you a lot.
I rang the bell.
The wolves are moving on packs.
Do you have any medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
Sunday the museum is closed.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost didn't win.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved in touch with what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We've finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain that in a little more detail?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we need to look into things.
So we're all in agreement.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie looks really good on you.
I think you're gonna make a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You're not gonna believe this.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's sync our watches.
I'm shopping every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a small-time store?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
And if I'd told you, I'd have told you.
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
From a distance, it looks like a man.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make hasty conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of the elderly.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Alas!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deep asleep.
She used to call him that.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We were discussing whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were gagged by the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
The children are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep going.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was tired.
I was counting on her.
Don't look, Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll be able to get there in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
A man eats bread.
He swims across the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone mediocre sends a message in a bottle, it's just a child's fantasy, when Christopher Columbus sends a message in a bottle, the fate of a whole country is at stake on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
The kids are playing dojo ball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room with no coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
The way he works doesn't show anything he can boast about.
We don't see things the way they are, we see things the way we do.
She kind of pushed the door.
Come when comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in Berberski.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
That's when I first visited the museum.
Is she staying in a hotel?
I don't like that jacket.
Tom and Mary came down the stairs together.
