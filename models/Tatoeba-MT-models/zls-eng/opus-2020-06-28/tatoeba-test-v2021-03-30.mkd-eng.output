It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm on foot.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's quit.
How much is it worth?
Our water was in the air.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking backwards.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
She looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves stalked the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did he pay for Tom's rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a map for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me. I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's an infant.
I don't live in Boston.
They're suing the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little browner in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I'd have said no.
I'm indebted to help him.
He's being critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spits on his gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestors.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually have lunch with?
I consulted him.
Have you ever considered quitting?
It's been all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rough.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop behaving Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on me.
I'd rather take the subway than take the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinded the film.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Are these the kind of things you buy?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Actin' is so good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
I get a nose every time I get cold.
We've met several times.
Nobody likes soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
They're all looking for luck.
Is anyone else in the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about it.
Tom used to treat me like shit in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still cost.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even obedient.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want a turnip.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one of those, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'm gonna be okay.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been postponing this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also take checks.
Vesnikov costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
Macedonia has four verbic ways: stated, conditional, commanded and foretold.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you for a second, Tom?
These pants are right.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember meeting the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our court is big.
It's a child's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom's driving me the fuck out of here.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd love to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
You've made a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't attract attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite baton.
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trolley.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got an alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I come with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about is food.
Make sure you don't get caught up in that muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they try to escape.
Everybody's going crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom's already been interrogated by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a bad room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on his face.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
It'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly distressed by the heavy speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than run away.
He's licked.
When do you learn?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a well - known paragraph from his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by humanoids.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear what I was saying?
Take a walk.
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Get the clamp out.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
You didn't like the prize, did you?
Look at the diamond.
I'm glad you're glad.
To be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this shining star.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in line.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is blunt.
We've been bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you give me a little help?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's Tom's.
There's not even a speck of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
An electric heater heats ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the treetops.
Let's forget about it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll rescind the whole thing.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
He's got his sleeve on.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's darkening.
The tubes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They're knocking right next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom told everyone I died by mistake.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to free Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where am I supposed to park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom had a bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom had his socks torn apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you did.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multiphase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the valley.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard is really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was merciful.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That was almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me over the head.
Is anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's almost got to go.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They've blocked him.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as you can.
Tom would have figured it out.
We were laughing at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfying?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that the previous dentist told him that he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Do not expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carito's right is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving around town with the brake up and down.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want Mary excluded from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Save it for yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unjustly, and they do not see their own conduct as undesirable.
He's wearing high heels to make it taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come over?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make any noise.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I'm sure I sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
The bucket's giving you energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
Big Meraklia is for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom's a skillful writer.
Something very similar has happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in her own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to give up the idea.
Tom's really pissed off.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as resilient.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes lit with anger.
Why'd you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
You're gonna have to ask him about that.
He gave his word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Come on, on foot.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom is richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
Creatures, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scratched his knee.
Where do the pinoles come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom came along and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You cook turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going so whatever he wants to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
He drank five sleeping pills a day.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom seemed to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete's not on fire.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to carry me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm in trouble.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He always washes his way out of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare phenomenon.
Tom's packing his bags.
How does that benefit?
That's very helpful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room's packed.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
Could not open the jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That doesn't have much priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom looks cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had a sickness, and she suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 outside the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and I can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix yourself.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cold feet.
It's not safe for me here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a blonde dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
Get them over here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom had his eyes flashed when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't exactly seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl said hello to me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue. This is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they're eaten by people.
Could you pull this arrow out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that one?
He's spending his money, not looking for water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask me to explain.
Come on.
It's a book that weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel obviously sound very badly, and I hear him in the next room chewing gum.
Did you get scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk around the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you teasing me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels guard us and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't do anything.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is Java.
Who saw me?
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's a real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary everything about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That's what's done.
These goats are bald.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
It's my fault I didn't call you back.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom sleeps tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood there in front of her.
There's more than one way out.
Tom has always protected his children a lot.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six flax headscarves.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look strange.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven't found the time to write that report yet.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's dressing up.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I really like to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are somewhat expensive.
Save yourself your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, watch this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to scribble?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you so much, Tom.
Today afternoon we will eat cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a hot bull.
I'm gonna take Tom home.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsocial.
It's a good night.
They traveled east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The pyramids that fell off the roof were torn apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the tub.
Just come by.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom doesn't feel ashamed.
Just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You better go.
Tom got the fuck out of here.
I've got two cameras.
What'd you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
It's on Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom dropped his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
Did someone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yelling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoeba are great.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Does Tom die of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French people write their word about "bubamara".
The hoist can raise 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
You okay with that?
We're pretty good.
Pig's been cut to pieces and fried.
Ask the expert.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to take action.
I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters are extorting a lot of money from the rich guy.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
Your conscience bites you, doesn't it?
Oh, my God, that's some blood.
I need one minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, your nose's running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything to repent.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We've set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She's got ten kids.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy now.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and bathrobes when I came in this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not correct grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that her results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree obstructed the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
No more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
He's doing his math best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
You put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's in vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's making us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at each wedding and at every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not unique to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out the pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what we're supposed to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to get my own house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
Usually what causes the pain?
We're addicted to work.
The box is made of potassium.
She failed the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.

Just try it.
I want to dance, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was a one-footer.
Is Tom interested?
I got it right here.
I want to have a little talk with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work in the open if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm hiding Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What is not darker for her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not wiser.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you come out so naked, you'll catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say something, Tom?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got shot.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've made white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
It's useless drama.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go myself.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom myself.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still can't be trusted.
What's the shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.
We're being lured.
The wounded soldier barely walked.
The sun's just up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?

I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light bounces away from the water.
Tom was sucking the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.

Go back to your posts.
Can I touch you?
You miss something?
Let a man sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked between the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a gentleman.
Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was spilling his hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gifts.
Tom was a hard worker.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the valley.
Do you want me to make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
She knows the more important capitals.
What's under the covers?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's been drinking to everyone.
You ready to go?
Tom's obviously lost his mind.
Tom came up to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her figure.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they used to talk about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
Who should we start worrying about?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed of talking like that?
They concluded the ship went down anyway.
Did you buy the cure?
Did he drink Tom?
It hurts my job.
The question is, who's gonna do it?
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was wrong at all.
Please ask me what's going on.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom is a wunderkind.
He's on foot going to school.
It's starting to get in our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very cocky.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He ended up in the fourth place of 56 runners.
Don't make any noise.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom made Mary's silence angry.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
You're making woolen sweaters.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never see you in that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't checked in.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me behind.
These animals are threatened.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
They all turned to see it.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We've heard very carefully so we don't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he's had a few beers.
You've got good eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Oh, yeah, he'll get better... when the willow gives birth to a grape.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me an ass.
Who's the fireworks coming from?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants what you want.
I didn't betray anything.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
I'm losing my hair.
The big question that no one has ever found the answer to, including me, despite thirty years of study of the female soul, is "What do women like?"

The villagers reap harvest.
Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we split up, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criteria for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I won't move.
Hold on a second.
I've got something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's enough air here.
She married zero of a man.
Wind's steady.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything masculine.
The old man was raised before he died.
I don't like this book.
I was lucky to have him.
What would I be looking for, Tom?
The sun is a star among billions.
I've caught the measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
Mystery solved.
Tom got admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm saying.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
The one who can hear butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
He wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They pulled a lot to see who was going first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to devour like goods!
But if I was in Brazil, I'd be so much more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just got off work.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu, and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food cools down, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw him.
Tom's knocking a little bit.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How do you find volume on a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's been drinking.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the pantry.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom's got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales are kind of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken up.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, but you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm really good at it.
Does it hurt so much?
I just wish I could support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who runs things here?
I've heard so much about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every people has their own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get cold.
What are you drinking?
The way it came - that's how it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom's got his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom's unforgivable.
What's your question?
Tom went to an ajjilak.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is it bothering you, Tom?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been well for two days now.
The intestine's a waste.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know what the difference is between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Coming out of this rain is out of the question.
I'll have them go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got asalal.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was shooting Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms associated with the poisoning of mushrooms?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch lesbian porn.
Who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that keyboard chord?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom got worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already believe.
He writes a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
The boy was impossible to swim over the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely made it out.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see Mary texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little dazzling.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most feel that computers will never know how to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and grab her -- it counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
It was blowing up a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and fake than be pessimistic and right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the traffic lights to change.
The boy kept his mouth shut.
The body of the ship is divided into several watery parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'll be washing dishes.
Let's drop the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You mustn't lose sight.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?"
He's not the shy guy he used to be.
You know what I mean?
Don't make a scene now.
What was told tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Some played jams, some played records, some with a ball, others rode a wheel or rode wooden horses.
Suspects destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy's coming from inside.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You hit your head.
We're going down.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like a kari.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine who wants the baby, because it's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to get home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom was caught in a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're on hand?
I'm gonna give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slap on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm good at it.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt his leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I made a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail at some point.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're not running out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anybody want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is it over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, all I had was a nag in my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's head hurts.
Oh, no, no, no.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He did his best.
He's greedy.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
Now they want everything you told them you're gonna give them.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about it.
I hope there were any witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never let you go.
He made it look easy.
You'd better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dry.
I was going to ask them for help.
Maybe it would be best if you called them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts very much.
At that time, we were 18 years old.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflowers.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Keep doing that.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom started to complain.
I think you should pick her.
Behave yourself.
You're a hoot.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked cruelly at Mary.
Tom was wearing a duxer.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her back.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
There's no burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
Just one glass of drink.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has rights.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going shopping because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's insinuating us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look anything like his dad.
Tom's not that bad.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, not that he expected anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go back home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get involved.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine fun that way, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to come with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom made his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard him sniff.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
The sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed used to these kinds of problems.
You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's dead.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if you can even say it's possible.
It's been an early day.
I bring bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome weakness.
How many pushups do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was going for alcohol.
Tom's on fire.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is difficult.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
Take first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
He was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed late.
You're a leper.
Everyone was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
It might seem strange.
No one can save themselves from death.
It won't do you any good.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that how much we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
You know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earache.
Dan got hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
This song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's up, Tom?
Mother's advice would outrank a friend.
We haven't saved ourselves from the danger yet.
Tom's freaking out.
He's been waiting ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.

She's swimming a lot.
The flowers are leaking.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Tataeba, immediately!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom'll get scared and give up.
Is this place available?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to intrude in any way.
Doesn't anybody want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom decided that Mary had a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.

Would you like to participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the cave.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I'd rather have a cup of tea.

I'm sleeping on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women end up running away from him.
Tom lit the curtain by accident.
Did Tom talk to you?
It's hard to understand self - injury if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's on the rise.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom got really mean.
What kind of situations would you take advantage of him?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.

Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Did you find someone to look after the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
That was an amazing experience.
Tom's on the phone.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has many problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I won't say anything.
It'd be good.

Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.

Tom, think about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.

I've seen him in person.
I want all my kids equally.
I'm not doing what you're asking me to do.

It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.

You're below his level.
It's too early for me.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom could hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please check the room.
Tom's still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me welcome Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't take more than five minutes.
If the time was running, the radioactivity would be reduced.
Should we believe that?
Why are you so dressed up?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to the chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one else has done anything else.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thanks for inviting us.
Tom erased the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made his statement.
They must be worried.
I drove him.
That gave me an idea.
The fed from the watch broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
It's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It's gonna be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You need to do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to watch the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom's got a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sledgehammer.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they pay pretty good.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear is green.
Tom repented what he told Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom's lost it.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom brushed his hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to begin.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
You had to.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a thank you letter to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's really close.
We were worried about you.
Experience isn't inherited - everyone gets their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
It stretches so much when it's washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm hiding him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I ran away from class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard for me to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll have him go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as the abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him out a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this cure.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball at the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted the situation cleared up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
There's no way to get to Tom's house this time.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom took a dump.
Please do it again.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's licking.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's awesome!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Is it possible it's Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He got voted Mayor of Boston.
Police found prints on the crime scene's shoes.
That's what I asked.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is, who's gonna tell him?
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a vertigo.
I'm gonna have to try to handle this on my own.
They've sanded the spaceship.
Tom wrote me over thirty messages yesterday.
Do you know for a fact that this isn't made diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What is the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
You dream you know.
I looked at it.
A great crowd has gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is untenable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
I like it that way.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut down the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left uneaten food on the plate.
Tom changed his course.
There's no man alive in the classroom.
Missile's inbound.
We laughed.
Tom was a little involved.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
Have a good trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was thoughtful.
Tom made it look busy, so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers come out quickly after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We're out of money.
There was hatred among them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I wouldn't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never ridden to be anything but who I am.
Sometimes it is hard to determine whether Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't heat me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Can you imagine a wish?
Sometimes children fear the darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom here is the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's getting sad.
Cubic hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's what I liked about him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them lick.
Too bad I didn't ride a bike here.
I have to go see Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is a fail-safe.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What'd you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to overshadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to look at another option?
You didn't give us a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I will do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's selling secondhand cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what needs to be done.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would get painful.
I didn't know whether to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come to visit us next month?
Marionettes are run by wires.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were stalking her because of her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he had to do.
I'll give them one more chance.
He just called me.
The failure has suppressed it.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people fear spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe genetically modified plants damage health bees.
You can go now.
They're stalling.
Tom's the second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
Tourists were not satisfied.
Tom's room is stockings.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like cobwebs - they hunt flies, but they let the wasps and the hornets break through.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key to his desk, just like he used to.
He took off his fur jacket downstairs, climbed up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't look the same on this subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was up to Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're city.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Have you been here long, Tom?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He avoided danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to do it again?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This shrimp doesn't spin.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I write my legacy.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Dear for you."
We were very close.
I'm sweating every day.
Give me your knife.
No one's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We have a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me breathe.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can tie me up, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat has its claws in my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "In four hours." "What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with my ex."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overworked.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're worrying me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
This is where I belong.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom's not as naive as most people think he is.
I punched a box in his jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm taking a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old coins.
There's a lot to tell.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
No damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We need to get them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten up.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
You like Boston?
Tom was so pissed off.
Why does Tom do that?
I have an assignment for you.
How is it formed by nouns?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got a bad cold from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be insane to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't get mad at us.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're really good at it.
That was a sneaky trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not done.
Tom was put in jail for spying.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only with a lump.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutlery.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sorrow in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He'd do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say something you don't mean.
I decorated my room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see how he's doing.
Let Tom drive his cake.
Our Chun was getting closer to the small island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute, my laundry's ready. I'm gonna go get it.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
I wish I had the willpower to keep a diet.
The man is currently in America.
He's believed to be guilty.
I'm gonna take a look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
That trumpet sounds really bad to me.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they talk about.
A boy grabbed my purse while he was walking by a wheel.
When's the last time you hit the baby?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm a hump.
They're gonna fire me because I'm so late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's it!
There's always a catch.
Your health is very important to me, so why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's really ugly.
Tom came back covered in mud.
That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's at the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw him in the trash.
We just got there.
Tom booked the seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom baked me a cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like being touched.
Look at the clouds.

Butler opened the door.
Tom made no mistake of it.
Get your hands off me.
Don't say that name around me.
Are you gonna throw that away?
Tom's got a good job.
They're my stuff.
Tom used to go for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'm gonna read this out.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a catastrophic failure.
He just got back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you get to Boston?
Something bit me.
Mushrooms contain significant amounts of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back at work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid to face a mistake than to make a mistake.
This is no other stupid question, but who's stronger, the lion or the tiger?
We'll have company.
We're classmates.
Tom took the carpet out of the champagne.
There's a girl missing.
Tom despises your impudence.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of the places he wants to visit.
From his glances, I concluded that I was angry.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me a red and white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
Shots fired three times.
I'll complain if I like it.
They're free.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in chorus.
I won't say another word.
You can make your job easier.
My son of a bitch, you know.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.

We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book?
I'll take you home.
Does your stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not nagging me.
Try to clean up.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
They're knocking right next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't wait now.
Has anyone seen Tom?
I could use a hand with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
It's been an amazing evening.
The smell of jasmine and lavender is my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seemed bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very sharp tip.
Get ready.
Put it down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you even if I was burning and you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is spreading.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Wouldn't you leave?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely warm.
Nobody wanted to get up from a table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom came by earlier.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.

Play that song again.

That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
Should we call him?

I saw him play cards with them all.
Tom seems confidential.
Shame on you!

I wish I hadn't married Tom.
I know what this is.
When's Tom coming in?
Could you pass me the remote control?
I'll get him to cut your lawn.
Help yourself once.
We cried in a duet.
I'll set the table.

I must have forgotten.
Tom got Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom can do almost anything.
We arrested him.
What else could you have done?
Please sign here.
I'll see if he's in there.
It's gonna be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order a pizza?
The worse, the better.

The wind changed direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?

Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not much of a sailor.
My dad's been incinerated by white cannons this past month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.

Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.

Yesterday was fun.
Tom might help us if we ask nicely.
Tom enjoys eating in restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.

How would you fix it?
That sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.

Are you always busy?

I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom a story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he was leaving at 2:30.
I'll go with him.
It's nothing to do with luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm truly sorry about that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at six.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll arrange for you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lamp caught sight of her.
I need to turn off my phone.
Time is good.
This was wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.

Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to put too much pressure on myself.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's studying at deaf school.

You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I took so long.
I don't want to wait.
What is it, invisible to him?
Radio's off.
I rejected Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money at a bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're coming with me and a dot!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our best.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
It's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.

Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going to the point.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You're the one they were after.
Let's go down the street.
A living soul wasn't in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a little longer.
Tom loves you anyway.
You're a nice cook.
There's no shorter way to the top, only to the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
You can tell you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked them all.
Automatic cars are now spread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my snack?
The organ was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making eggs.
I want the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't sugarcoat my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play bagpipes?
They chose her well.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my duty to spend the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a waste of time.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what?
They took off their clothes to bathe.
A river from the sweat started pouring on my face.
Mary gave up moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How was your trip?
The movies are a great party.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests should we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody was smiling.
I didn't ask your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they'll come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world is shining on the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary wants hot coffee, Tom wants some.
I gave you a false address.
I've been in the room.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you're freaking out.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's got a kick.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's he buying Tom?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be that stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get up.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You're paying me very well.
I feel like I'm a whole new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
I have to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost ran into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom disobeyed his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What made you sad?
We'd like to see Tom.
Where were you, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come in on time.
The Germans have a loose attitude toward nudity.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women love a man with a mustache.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you accept the tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They're both screaming.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for one kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't see that coming.
Can you deliver this?
I had no luck at all.
His body was grown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary crying.
I've really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know it sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island’s settlements are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always preferred secretive characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I meant to tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent poets.
Can't be any coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom, he's never coming back here again.
No one likes crying.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's a knockout.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
Soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly trash bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He's used to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
The time has come to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is drugs.
This is a little harder.
You see, you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I have a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a second.
Her long hair was boned brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never look for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his point?
I love someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a few donuts.
I'm French.
I don't want to see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We have to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wore a suit.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women love a man with a mustache.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname fits perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
She's ruining her clothes.
You pulled out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom was reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little down in the morning.
Nobody understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's a skillful writer.
Tom took a look.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a piece of shit!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to give in.
Tom was suspended.
They're coming together.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of saying that to Tom.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks like a mess.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
We may find help in the nearest village.
We hope she's okay.
You're capable, but you're missing.
He works at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's pissed off.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Commendations move students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measured on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's had a lot changed since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom got his nose up.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only for nobles.
Tom's been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How do you choose just one person?
I came to feed Tom the fish.
I'm actually here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloodthirsty bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't have been safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your children's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Just leave us to heaven.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunderbolts?
Don't mix business with pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and directed it towards the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a really bad headache.
As soon as I looked at him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank loaned a million dollars to the company.
I've got a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember what the guy's name was.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just go inside.
He forged a sword of steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I said mine.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When are we gonna see each other?
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls him the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had more than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did he want to see, Tom?
I'm so scared.
A day of rage.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their point?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you study in?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
He did a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
My blood vessel broke in my eye.
That's where he visited Mary yesterday.
You overdid it!
He's got a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show is going to give up; they didn't sell anything a lot of cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does he swim often, Tom?
The girl's asleep.
Go do some homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laugher.
Tom paid me.
I'm so busy reading books.
He's been executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom's acting silly.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was so hot.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their faults.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I got the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come in a car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already caught a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one less suitcase, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do it right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd take out the bascule.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
It was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightnings usually accompany thunders.
Tom wants cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom cornered him on the ground.
This lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the cabinet for glasses.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to hang out with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you haven't slept yet?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I set fire to the junkyard.
We've both seen it.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made myself very clear.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this just too much?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back in touch with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign on the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way it holds its head reminds me of Maria.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are so hot.
Tom would have fought back.
She's always worth it.
What country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I prefer cats dogs.
There's still little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
You can't handle this heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it like that.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Get on with your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree sails.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchens.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'm gonna get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her back?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought there were bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's still some tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise pissed me off.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you so.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's skillfully handling a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
You've given up the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a whirlpool.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really pissed off.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was sickened with semen.
Tom is fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand what's coming from you.
Tom seeks to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're acting childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it's started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Sheika blew the tire.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'll make her cut your lawn.
Tom's good for math.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a brook.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We were eating lobster and fencing.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They took the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You think she's weird because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before last.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for that.
It's still not right.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The cup was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please move quickly.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where do these documents have to be submitted?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is compromised.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the bathroom mirror is clouded.
Tom was taking pictures.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I can go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom put all this together.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's soft.
Before that, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did what I had to do.
Tom is so far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is dead.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I wasn't taught that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was dropping a femur.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake if you borrowed Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers to the bureau.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
Looks like these two are dating again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
Moral choice is whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he produced.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd get him some help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom seems worried.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I'm impressed with Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary in the eye and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you here, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't sleep over.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be notified in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't need to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a wuss.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to go, Tom?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure in dust.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
Depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her grandmother.
It's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom fell asleep.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
That's a fire extinguisher, and it started spraying.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think that's what they're for.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I'll never forget it.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer's numb.
My grandmother used to live with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so the conscience does make us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You made a mistake.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen gives off green light.
English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound's starting to rot.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't do anything.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint candy?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to stay the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
His blood vessel broke in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have on the car?
Is that your mom?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you could get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids were drawing pictures on the chalk sidewalk.
You wonder what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to get her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married 26 years old.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom seemingly doesn't often realize what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the magnificent chandeliers in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have on the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She's a good swimmer.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom got here.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light here to read.
Tom made up for Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick.
Guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what you just told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as day comes.
Mr. Gorbachev, bring down this wall!
Tom seems startled.
Tom's melted.
It's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you saying?
I'll call him right back.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt this loving.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the words?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
It's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in the ass.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's still mad.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom got here just in time.
Today is boring television.
Oh, wonderful!
Tom's found a four- Listed child.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say good-bye to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds perfectly valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom made it safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're a lot alike with Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of sparks that fly from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept his mouth shut all night long for Mary.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather the soul.
I'm sure he'll pass a closer-up exam.
We're heading to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was awful.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
In case of an emergency, what number should I call?
I still love the horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom's starting to whine.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say hi?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be objectively determined but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's inconspicuous.
His girlfriend got weak.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming wakes up from a nightmare.
Tom's got weak eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it done?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom's got his eyes open.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open it.
Put on your coat.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to pick up.
I already wrote down everything that was meant to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this one?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're too cocky.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatseba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back.
That's how you need it.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden for him.
Tom's still playing golf, right?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was impressive.
I can't see anything.
He's a rather unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on that spot.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are no good at all.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's a bust.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut you.
Secretion is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay good money.
Tom's probably out.
We weren't fighting.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are both difficult and easy and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's a disappointment.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom's a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm in charge.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is a lot of Fusher writing.
You're supposed to help them.
Tom wasn't even crying.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is sadder than stupidity and indifference.
They're all snotty.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What's the Web site's brakes?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What do you have in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day cleaning the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll take that later this afternoon.
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the drum out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You traitor!
I'll do anything for mankind's sake.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm getting some sleep.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a connection between the character and the blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a male product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Push this button.
Tom can really fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke up his car.
You must overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom is cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is roasted in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see the way things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is a lot like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There's a lot of rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees collapsed.
Lions don't distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's tricky.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're too far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can picture you getting married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.

Why do cows survive?
My puss is flowing from my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Uploading calendar to wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone's ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
What couldn't you sleep on last night?
They've cast a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The turtles have lived a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very well.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here in a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait one minute?
You're amongst friends.
You're getting a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a hot night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from a half-breed.
Can You Explain That?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom's got his shoes on.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom's shaking hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I interrupting?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love that.
I'm a fag.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick.
I'm going after myself.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's licking his boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom shaved his face.
What use do I have to you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when he wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live upstairs under this one.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are kind of on mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's making fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
He opened the door, even though I had told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.

I drew the word “Alice ” to point it out.
Third chance.
We need to tear it up.

You're smart.
I'm against this project.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I got here too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's some writing reports.
It hurts in here.
You're worrying Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just stalking you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most unpleasant time.
This dog is staring at me like he's trying to eat me.

Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really nice.
Everybody dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.

I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.

She's got ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not unreasonable.
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom's back off.
Don't say it again.
Cherries are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You made Tom miserable.
Warm it up.
Tom looked like he was infuriating.
What else can Tom do?

If I could have stayed, I would have stayed.
Please stop.

You always leave your bike dirty.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What'd you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should draw attention to readers.
You were sitting right in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's in pain.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French movie with an English translation.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Tom's full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that child’s illness is false.
Dan had a bad relationship with Linda.
Everybody's back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us back.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.

I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.

His eyesight's weak.
That's my specialty.

You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm in a lot of pain here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom got cut off.
Tom couldn't remember where he left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll take my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's over.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.

I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom would be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.

If I hadn't already eaten, I'd have had lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.

I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
And tomorrow we'll see each other?

It's kind of oily.
That was a wonderful experience.

Just look at yourself.
This is magnificent.

I messed up.
It's made me sick.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice has melted.
I spit blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
I'm sure you're relieved.

I'm pretty proud of it.
Don't bother.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught a fish.
It's boring sitting at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
I have to buy a new tree for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't take it.
It's sunny, but it's cold.
What's this really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us out as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have been on our first day.
Let's go hang out.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
"Will you not eat the spinach?" "I will eat it later."
This is my favorite item.
Tom took off his weight.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?

Don't fight.
I'm expecting help from you.

When was the last time you had to do this?

I doubted it that way.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is not your friend or your soul, it's just indifferent.

What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do then?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat at the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
First, I'm going to make out.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
It was only a few days before he turned ninety-nine years old.
Did you look everywhere?
It is important to remember that no one is ever 100%.
He gestures as he talks.
Sit next to me.

Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.

I'm collecting stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a mess.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fusher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you whenever he wants.
I don't want to talk about her.

It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to disguise yourself this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's an act of refusing to forgive.
The door shut.

How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was going?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary was looking at him.
You're making me strong.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.

Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky is bright.
The noise will wake the baby.

Tom and Mary play rummy.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
You picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.

A long walk called for his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom has a cup of tea and doughnuts.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it was done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Did you go outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom senses danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's a mess.
Tom is the highest guy in the class.
Tom, you're growing up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Have you written in a diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'm gonna try really hard to get there in time.
Nobody came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're about ready.
Tom has a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I can't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the wallpaper.
I helped him rip apart the table.
I had a potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is nasty.
I'm sorry I even said something to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could have found someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom drank it.
I slept in the Chun.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That can really work.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
There's an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asal Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was slang at first.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's too bad.
Too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
You've got me all wrapped up in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems like a dead end.
You're having a party. You're still young.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demek, do I need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't care.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just painted Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm gonna go help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son likes rockets very much.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He came before them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent the new fly that he just bought to the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed.
The landscape is too great.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'll try to contain myself.
The fall came.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to blow up.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was magnificent.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and they are gifted with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of common human belonging.
Getting engaged was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I've got a friend.
Tom wants to do everything by himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup's too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
That means "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked in the tunnel.
How can you be my friend?
Seems familiar.
I envy.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basil, the mourning, the rosemary, the thymian, and the oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a perceptive man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have lied to you, but she doesn't have me!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him all of it.
They hurt me.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a shopkeeper.
It's simple to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's really fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to get shot.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but there he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look into the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like it's out of the question, Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
- Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I like to make him makeup.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
How about your name and phone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing under the line outside the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons I can think of.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't get it.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why should I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
Everyone's got a hunch.
I'm still thinking about her.
I found out today that there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom's still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
He wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom's got a collection of midwifely.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
You got enough?
Mouses are plague transferers.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom gave it up.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I want fried bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
We were hugged.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom says hello to Mary with a wave.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty good.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would I do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States is about to launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom's tied his ties.
I can't put it out.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good at this.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Tom wandered off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's a non-negotiable fact.
Is it delicious?
Look out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little oily.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom gave himself to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survive the type of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I will examine his bellies.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open up the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please peel the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I'm making my toasts with honey in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I've got a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the count.
I'm impressed with your design.
You told me to call back anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna take off my weight.
That's exactly what happened.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
Tom can help you, too.
I wonder why we got married.
How do we benefit from that?
I'm with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
To me, every Finnish sentence is a quick word.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good for sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom felt he needed to be redeemed.
It's a warning to them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your match.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He waved the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek, I wrote this book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not get cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were happy.
What can we do to help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must drain it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
Nobody listens to you.
All right, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
That's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go into pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We've visited the castles of Laura.
Tom is hopeless.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Grab me by the cancer alone.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very good at his job.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I do a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a pie.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Blow it and get in there.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems reliable.
Would you like some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four corners each.
I kept working.
They're developing an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Get the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary was throwing herself at her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mass.
Tom erased the blade from the jeans knife.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your palate bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his pint of beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
We take a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I don't want to eat cloned animal meat.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how it's possible.
He looked at me hard through the glasses.
Linda's got Dan stalking her.
Why would they mind that?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is resilient.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave properly.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom's been struggling with depression for more than a lifetime.
You want me to grab your bags?
I'd trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class goes wild.
There were penguin footsteps on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the tow truck.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to all of us that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you like.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was gnawing something.
She's studying English.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spits out the chewing gum.
Make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
What bad habits are easily gained!
She's been acting weird.
They probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda about her interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What should we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat in time.
You always get me wrong.
You and me, we're just as strong.
The president looked strong.
Buy what?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I won't say it again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people fear enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's that, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer be careful.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now it's time to make up for it.
Most virgins have whole hymens.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had been delayed, we waited for a long time in the rain.
You'll be fine.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary wore fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French more than he really was.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Mary did not understand the talk.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are so hot.
That medicine calms the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fuscherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what they need to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's good work.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy your day.
Tom just freaked him out.
I prefer goat cheese to cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini's finished.
A single - sex couple should not be able to marry.
The cow forgot it was ever a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom buried him alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What are they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.

Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?

I'm in.

Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep it off.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I'm starving to get you down.
The real story is a little different than what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly descending.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't thought about it, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't make any sense to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; either way, you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?

No one went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?

Maybe you'll need it.

It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.

You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost there.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night are shining.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I travel to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on the bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom, get the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm a good listener.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom won't like that.
All comments are out of line.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them help?

That smells like cheese.

The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?

Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I took a nap there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did you get up early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's loud in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found it.
Don't take it too literally.

That's good training.

Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the mild things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will stray.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I've had a bit of a bit of a nudge.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch out for Tom.
They look familiar.

You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, football field and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should've quit sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My efforts so far have been in vain.
"Why do you do that?" "I can."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polarally opposed: one was sincere and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going down.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna quit.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two tribes in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are tied.
Tom was in charge.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're in luck.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where was Tom working?
I need to carry them at midnight.
The noise clouded all the city.
A person who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They're flashing.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom did.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing clothes.
Tom was barefoot.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom acts like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we had to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm growing goods.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and resilient.
I wish I could help you more.
You can't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They were completely renovating the building's facade, and when I walked past her in a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all that's possible?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children sat in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
Tom knows Boston very well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They're sedating.
This is not about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, that's what's gonna happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser throws out hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all our money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here by myself.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone helping me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm no good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older ones.
The gems include the aquamarine, the amethic, the emerald, the quartz, and the ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother for permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're doing a lot of chickening.
It's been a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I was having lunch in a hurry.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else remembered.
It's easy to tell them apart.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I learned, the French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I count to 200.
Check this out.
Shall I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Butterflys are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We've got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project's not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed us to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I've got homework.
He was breathing deep.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Did you get there in a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom's got plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom was always poor.
It's a beautiful bracelet.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a lot of money from her.
Can you help me handle this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was for her to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make cobwebs.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what the other guy says.
He's head to toe in love.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
It's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're out of your mind!
Seems to me that's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm gonna do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've done enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we gonna eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon, the sound went out.
Who cut your hair?
I don't really understand it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom getting in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't take off.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It's been a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
I think I might sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
You want me to look after him?
You're a real man-hater.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
No one's talking.
What made you contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
You should be all right.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks that old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
It was fun listening to music.
Try your shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
Now I can barely work.
When did you say Tom was gonna start his party?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a really good job.
My legs still hurt.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to judge his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting over there.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to hear you.
Stand where they are.
Are you her pimp?
"She loves music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut his hair.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna lose myself.
Her sister gave her a flu shot.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder cleaning his own gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the compositions were good except for yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.

Next year, my birthday's gonna fall on Sunday.
Everybody laughed.
Did Tom seem happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's making pushups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been in this cave?
Dan didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I was doing it.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one's here.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing looks like a drunker than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking his clothes off.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This is almost working.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This drug will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their audacity.
Dan didn't miss an episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We need to ask you a few questions, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard him.
We're looking into the entire area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
We'll be right here.
Why would they do that?
I studied for four years, and I had nothing but a miserable degree.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, all that's left is ashes.
Tom wants every vegetable but cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.

That's a little rough.
They decided to shut him out of their company.
Those who mix Glagolitic endings "tsya" and "she" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened after that?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on it.
I was reckless.
Just last week I saw Tom.
It shouldn't take us long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom caught her cleaning up.
We're so angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom found two pipes.
He's been lying in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish sentences for the whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You made some money.
It's really bad.
Do you want some cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all-wise and godly.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car well.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people of the earth came from a common ancestors.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it myself.
What's that?
Can humans really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks a Caucasian language that has neither common phonems nor common letters with English, can completely overcome English in just two years?

What's your bag?

Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I have something for him.
How do I know if Tom's the right guy for me?
Tom studies agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a great sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him out of the way.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering what a good singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
Why didn't you help us?
I like to learn French very much.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned the hard way.
You showed my friends the fake.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
Cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
Excuse me.
What kind of books do you need?

I'm full.

I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and have a look.
Do you think you're attractive?
Innocentness is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's heart rate's up.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept whispering about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, brave, and yet I don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You're busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to his victory, he became a hero.

I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.

The virtues are a reward to themselves.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We're supposed to be advertising on TV.

They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing is right for me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very difficult.
Tom stopped crying.
All this stuff is waiting for me.
Is it real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
She seems very sleepy.
Yesterday, I prepared a mushroom roast.
I hope it works.

Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread's fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to question him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom left.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did he want to eat Tom?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom turned him down.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
Have you ever written Tom a letter?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're just in time.
I was kind of sorry for you.
Cigarettes suck for adults.
Tom and Mary left prints on the liquid cement.
Cavalier would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was irrefutable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't play Tosha.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check in on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would say no.
No one deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Thankfully, the hollow is stable, otherwise the storm last night would have crashed it anyway.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got it all written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll give it up.
Mary’s eyes were shining with pleasure.
It's evil to swear.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How's it going, guys?
I'd really like a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself secretive.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom won't come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller tricked him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.

I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.

It's a simple job.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to see her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing Tataba's new version.
It all seems aimless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why aren't you singing?
Did he really do it, Tom?
I didn't even know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not good for sports.
I'm amazed, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Come on, let's go.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt so lonely.
I really like to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
It's done wonders.
The glands produce chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was helping.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I was kind of sorry about her.
He's overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could've said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It'll happen soon enough.
Hey, it's stuffy in here, take me out before I choke.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.

Do you feel guilty?

I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you talk louder?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "Truth or Challenge".
His conclusions are based on unproved assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started looking through the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom likes flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I passed out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you putting yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife is sick of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amoeba are single cell organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom wrapped my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's so stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is more sustainable.
I'm cold.
He was walking right in front of me.
Give me that back.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
It's possible someone followed them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a cash register.
Let me introduce her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
She's just gone.
The children were so excited after the party they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You defeated me.
Do you think we'll get to the station on time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive.
An international language would be very useful to mankind.

She's kind.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
You want some soda?
Tom winked at the girls.

Get them off the deck.
Japan has many different features as a country.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in the convents.
Don't be so perverse!

Attend to the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating lamb cranberries, potatoes and mushrooms for dinner.
We were waiting outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.

It's hers.
That's not exactly an option.

It wasn't very good.

Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They hurt you, right?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remains irresponsible.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
Dance.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy ran to me.
Tom seems very tired right now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
The cells are the basic components of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I should go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died the day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom picked the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom was soon lost in the crowd.
For your information, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a beaver.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the job we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sex-transferable disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around at the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you blink when we kiss?
Someone's gonna see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's snooze.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't say that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the peace.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I'm messing up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Everything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I are flying the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with the beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to take the time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to free himself.
What will I be to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
This isn't the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old-fashioned.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has waves of hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's really strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was affected.
My conscience is biting.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'm gonna have time to do this.
Tom got drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're talking a lot.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom is doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I pay my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his hearts together.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the King's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed things.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to burn your car down.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to hang out.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just be in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on the alert.
He's a little deaf, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
You're the one.
That's a very dry explanation.
Before breakfast, walks are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt from the top.
When's the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
It was a really good dinner!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm kidding.
Tom took off his hat and bowed down.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what the papers say today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom hurried loudly.
It was Better.
Tom's starting to roar.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaked out.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom put his hand down.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam has clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the alkaline flag?
Make yourself comfortable!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Even though I'm a man of godliness, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there any problem I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so mad.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to investigate something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in mean.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned this whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The cure must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
It's my fault.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house is cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't gargle.
Tom's regaining consciousness.
Tom made Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be coming today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the willpower.
Will you help?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it already.
You'd rather die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of family are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
They're boring me.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I already wrote my part of the report.
I don't think they've made up a cure yet.
Each member must attend.
She didn't get the joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Did you get his name?
I guess it's not helping.
You have to let me give Tom a message.
Where's my golf cart?
Read these instructions.
We're not offenders.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's the luck?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
He sprained his clavicle while he was dancing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blinding.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom's got a lot of nerve.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking.
Watch the road.
We'll stand in the way.
I heard Tom roaring.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve about it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy anyway.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost his heart.
There's no comment to make.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
All right, you were here.
They look appalled.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave home to get my slippers.
I think Tom's a stickler.
It went away from a terrible infection and the ovary and it came out.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't work.
It's out of the question.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He used to be weird.
We'd hang them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a capini cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right back.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to gossip.
I've got tons of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Each language looks at the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We've got everything.
What's one beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where'd you find it? Where'd you find it?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we had a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for demecveres?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you have a crush on him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are picking up in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You got your ankle up.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little involved.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy these things.
Not here or there.
Phonebooks are fascinating.
You don't need to be defensive.
This is the most beautiful pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
