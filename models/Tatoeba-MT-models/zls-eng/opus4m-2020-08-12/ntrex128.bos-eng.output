The Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about the similarity with the Muppets
Some members of the assembly are upset over the proposal to change their title to "members of the Velika Parliament" (MWP).
This came because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this could become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour member of the assembly said his group is concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers van Wells: In Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of the political party Plaid said the group was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative titles.
A member of the Welsh conservative party said his group was "open" on name change, but noted that there was a small difference between the concepts MWP and Mupetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of letters in Yorkshire English.
The assembly commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the members of the assembly's titles will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The law of the government of Wales in 2017 gave the assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the assembly to the Velski Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the commission gave priority to the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly allegedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give the chairman's headaches to Elina Jones, who is expected to hand over a draft bill on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the plan of the commission's system.
Members of the congregation will have the last chance to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to referendum on state name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name represents its own territory and has persistently opposed its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe the name change is simply the price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin have been silenced as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There is neither today nor today."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People are friends today differently," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living room where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as the executives expect, "and sooner or later, they'll go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help preserve the remaining neighbourhood shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore the closure of these churches will be accelerated because it is unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby has taken possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building very badly, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made a recovery plan, they ordered the organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these are the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger organ at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church didn't find him a replacement.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by church heads and other bishops.
The bishop's administration - the administrative body of the diocese, composed of church heads - wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the bishop's office, although the bishop's administration was not involved in the rent of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old during a lobster hunt in California.
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened just before seven o'clock in the morning by Beacon's Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard a boy cry for help and then rode to him with a group and helped get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a thrill to catch the lobster, but then "he realized he was yelling 'he bit me!'
She's got me!'
His whole clavicle was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone to come out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!'' Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady's pediatric hospital where his condition was being handled as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, said in an address to the media that the shark had already been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper hull area.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's becoming a competition with chains of Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams to departments of cosmetic products in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
As a significant breakthrough to the beauty market in Britain is worth £2.8 billion, which is on the rise while sales in fashion and home equipment markets are dropping, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will be extended to several stores next year if they are successful.
Investment in cosmetic products occurs because supermarkets find ways to use shelves that were once used for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic range by offering more than 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product range L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in departments similar to those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its Boutique make-up line by making most products suitable for vegans – something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop will test the stores in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Network shopping and a shift towards the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops mean that supermarkets must make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said that shops will increasingly look like supermarkets in the effort of supermarkets to retaliate with big discounts on Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the departments of Argos stores in hundreds of his shops, and he also introduced divisions of gallons since they bought both chains two years ago, saying it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to modernise their cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments ended infamously.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended in a dispute over the division of pharmacy revenues in their shops.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £ 125 million three years ago.
Lloyds has been said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be handy to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an inevitable destination of beauty markets that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, is "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his 11 million-pound personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and additional equipment, Truly.
This couple's company is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of this Morning (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons' Den Peter Jones' star by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when the Golden Girl of Television admitted, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, mean there is no more time to devote to their brand of home and additional equipment, Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would provide her with a profit over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was startled by everyone involved.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a lot of products in the Marlow headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this Morning, among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and home equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in March as director of the company.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become Ambassador Brenda M&S and replace Ante McPartlin as head of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about criticism he could get from the media because of comments he could characterise as "non-presidential" and a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his funny voice, "The News Reader."
"I didn't give in at all."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denucleisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "adequate response" from the United States to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were one step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relations."
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kim had brought positive results -- the suspension of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he stepped in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs are told that their help is not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been moved out, the state of the national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, they are still not sure whether foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in aid.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there were no tsunami sirens on the island of Palu, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands pose a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to help earthquake victims is en route to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesian long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has hit Mr. Yoko's administration while next year's elections are expected.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure because of the long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street struggles of Christian and Muslim groups, who used machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge put a deep equalizing hit on Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to the Premier League by hitting 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge took the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea's goal club while his team lost 1-0.
He transferred the ball to his left, and then he kicked it to the outer pole.
The ball flew high above the penitentiary by turning to the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually she fell through Kep Arrizabalg, who was on the jump and fell into the net.
"It was only up to the positioning, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturrudge told Liverpool.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazzard scored a hit in 25 minutes.
The blue gunman added the ball to Mate Kovacic in his fifth attack before running from the middle of the field into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic touched it quickly and returned the ball to the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into the penitentiary.
Hazzard was faster than the defense and ended up near the stand by putting his left foot in the net than Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Naples in the Champions League's group phase at three o'clock on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's playing Videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock Thursday in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami victims rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A lot of buried people have been reported in the ruins of buildings that brought down a 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of committing murder.
The police have called people nearby who have seen or heard something to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I invite everyone who was near John Street Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is relevant to the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived at the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He ran out of text when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told they'll have to wait hours before they're allowed back inside.
They heard a cop tell a man the whole area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of a crime in tears.
She kept saying "this is so awful."
At 2:00, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van next door.
Most of the cops were inside the police cordon watching the apartment building.
All those who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 citing case 247 since 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament has become the newest monument in the middle of an argument over "the revision of history"
Its removal would represent poetic justice because of the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England carried out by his Puritan followers in the Taliban's manner.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as crazy and "try revising history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said, "In the context of the ongoing debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's image would become a target in front of the Palace in Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out iconoborship during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestors Thomas from the last century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell author Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the character many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps more late 19th century than today, a protector of parliament from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Is this completely accurate is the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-seventh century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of glory and memory."
A pig killer inflicted deadly injuries on a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man known to have been named Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pig market in the town of Liupanshui in the area of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to inject the pigs with vaccines in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining in the Qinghai area, China.
He reportedly arrived with a relative from the neighbouring Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550 libri pig inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," said a cousin who introduced himself to the last name Wu, Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera log shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners allegedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a six-fifty pig was fond of a Welsh farmer next to his tractor until his wife scared and drove her away.
After the pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Ross bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened moving above the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to showers across northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa’s first - category hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles per hour from five o’clock in the morning of eastern time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is forming in the Pacific and is moving towards the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north of the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the coming days.
Placemically, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, application and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfalls that will periodically reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest regions, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical dispersion of tropical rain.
Walking out into the desert would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rains.
The heavy rain in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and the thunderstorms, at times, with strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming gap will bring metric rains on the coast of southern California.
Total rainfalls of over half an inch are possible, which could cause application and slippery Augustes.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
The late scattered tropical shower will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
In October, high temperatures fluctuation across the United States may occur as the Arctic becomes colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will again try to accumulate and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most Central and Eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
A long-term weather forecast announces a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political reluctance continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasting due to Friday's latest plot: a deal Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a week-long investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100% certain that the cooty Kavanaugh had touched and tried to break up at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company was hosting CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network channels.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty listing people who monitor the transfer from the office.
In order for it to be better spelled out, it's an audience similar to that accompanied by football elimination matches or an Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters yelling at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He was standing there looking down for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live feed on CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, ‘You have power while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, there was more to be said at the commission's hearing.
Cable and television networks had live coverage hours later while the judicial commission voted whether to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the appointed next week, as the minority of Democrats calls.
Flake was partly persuaded by a conversation with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times daily.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that is up to her on the front page of the diary, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU take customs from each other "fully absurd".
Wade Sims' murder: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, a suspect in the LSU's death
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials posted a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS network's WAFB channel.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he confessed to killing Wade.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East district's mortuary of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot from a gun to the head and neck.
The department said the merits belonged to a police task force for Louisiana's fugitives, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the residents of the areas that helped during the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU Club Joe Alleva thanked the district agency for implementing the law on "difference and aspiration for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-and-six-inch shooter grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "snake" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we constantly care about," Wade said.
Vulcan casts ashes on Mexico City
The ash pulverizing the Popocateptl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity increased in a crater and after 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The center followed several earthquakes and rumblings.
The pictures on social media show a thin layer of ash covering windscreened cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity of volcanoes located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations marking the anniversary of a polarising Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police squad, threw eggs and powdered paint at them, making dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, the clashes broke out with the police who used the pendrakes to suppress the fight.
Independence supporters have been running for hours "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" and have faced the supporters of the union who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region that has been defined for independence a year after a referendum on October 1st, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although turnout was low because opposers of the secessions boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by violent clashes across polling stations across the region.
Independence groups camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we are now in a bind," he said.
Although they took the key but close victory in last December's local elections, the Catalan parties that advocated independence had difficulty holding back momentum because some of their most famous leaders were in self-imposed exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone for police support, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in next year's European Parliament elections.
"A candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the backdrop of democratic values and repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into a house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after multiple car crashes into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said it was a damaged gate just like the building itself.
There's a possibility that at some point a car was fired from a crossbow.
Menge's goal was to win a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
First goal of Dolly Menge has secured a win for Livingstone
The promoted Livingstone surprised the Rangers and recorded only a second loss for Steven Gerard in the 18 matches of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club did not record any winnings in the premiere league this season and will play against the first-place Hearts for which eight points lag next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in the European League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of games to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed the opportunity against the guests who lacked the edge
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt passed by naked, then Alan Lithgrove's attempt passed naked after he slipped to receive the ball Craig Halkett put on his head.
The hosts were well suited to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free punches.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
There was a free shot against the Rangers, Livingstone made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who took the ball and hit from the middle of the penitentiary.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and Liam Kelly's goalie had little trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by the feet of goalie Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow kicked too wide from another free shot for Livingstone.
Crosses were constantly arriving at Livingstone's penitentiary and were constantly defended, while the two foams they were looking for – one after the foul against the deputy player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the hand game – were not assigned.
"Phenomenal Game" by Livingston – Analysis
BBC reporter Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macarona Arena
Awesome game and the result of Livingstone.
Each one of them was excellent and continued to exceed expectations on the upward path.
Their game style and players have almost not changed since their return to the top, but great credit belongs to Holt who has given her energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Holkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, until Mengo put Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell at peace throughout the match.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were once in a while under Gerard's baton, they didn't reach that level.
The final blows were missing – only once they broke through the rows of the host – and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers located in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Keln
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing NATO allies' relations.
They differed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU entry.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where most Turks live outside Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and decision by the German government to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect a split in opinions about a guest some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocratic.
A car accident in Deptford: A cyclist died in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street intersection, on a traffic road in Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 British time.
The driver stopped and intervened with the ambulance team, but the man died on site.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist died in an accident where the driver left the scene of the accident, on Childers Street Street, which is about a mile away from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The London police said they were working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets are closed, buses are redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in high-security riots for men, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison, in the Worcestershire area, on Sunday around 9:30 British time and still ongoing.
A Special Branch of Officers called Tornado to calm down the riots involving eight protégés in one wing of prison.
Officials sustained minor facial injuries and were given assistance on site
A spokesman for the prison administration said, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel dealing with the ongoing incident in Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be forwarded to the police and could be extended to prison sentences."
In Long Lartin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden of the prison was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, a special task force was called to prison for serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is exactly what will most likely happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa passes her remaining energy through desert southwest areas, carrying with her the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce rain Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Meteorology Authority in Phoenix pointed out that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogolon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches and up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
In areas where there is no fear of floods, Rosa’s rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these rainfalls will likely benefit because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to US drought control agency, slightly more than 40 per cent of Arizona has been hit at the very least by extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
First, on its way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a rink on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific and will cause it to submerged.
Therefore, Mexico is expected to hit by the power of the tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Showers in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a great risk of flooding.
"The total rainfalls from three to six inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, and perhaps up to 10 inches," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico with the power of the tropical storm before she reaches Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday late evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its lags is the great showers in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the US southwest desert," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These showers are expected to cause lush floods that are life-threatening and apply in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning at about 4 a.m. British time.
He was taken to the hospital and in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are urging those who have any mobile phone footage to answer.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the indignation and rage" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered in the indignation and rage" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the splendor, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most real legal minds of our age, a lawyer with excellent achievements in public service," said a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched directly on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I am not personally running, I am actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claims the Democrats are trying to "produce resistance and disrupt".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican party official for CNN said.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase.
At least 384 people died, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the big earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves up to six feet (18 feet) hit the shore at dusk, taking many to death and destroying everything that they have found their way to.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat was announced yesterday, people were still engaged in their beach business and did not immediately escape, and they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster resolution agency, addressing Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he wore cars, balvana, houses, hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800km per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the town of Palo.
Photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPTT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake was 200 times higher than the force of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II on Friday.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of a long narrow bay has increased tsunami strength, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "much" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had been torn down.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be more along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Dongala area, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show a man on the upper floor who panics about the coming tsunamis on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters couldn't confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused the power to cut off communications around Palu by making it difficult for the authorities to save their lives.
The military started sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuation still needs food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims has climbed over 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization must have arrived from Donggala in Pal, where the employees were stationed in tents erected in the office's yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the road, said Mr Dozeba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began taking the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the inflow of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This remains a disaster of the province's level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but this status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis falls at Palo on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be tempered.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been buried for two days in ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that for hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread through the paraglider circles, whatsApp was desperately sending to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 during the charge of ATMs at the Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves, according to a Newport police report, stole $26.750 from a Brink worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver was emptying an ATM in a fun complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, said the statement, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the NYPD in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time as Ye and used the title for the title of its eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where his new album Yandi is expected to be promoted.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", the show author said.
In addition to his current professional name, West said earlier that this word had religious importance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with radio director Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An ex-West associate, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without cartoons and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico has sworn not to use the army against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday "never to use the army to conquer the Mexican people".
The army fired peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, said the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US authorities issued posts on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, announced its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the area of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happens in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CBS this week.
Lee, whose book "Superforces of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, was the executive director of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the most ranked American Othello player, and was later CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged earlier technological competitions by the US government such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they planned the next competitions in which future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"Don't take away China's academic leaders, that's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant university individuals in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctors from the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, in the United States, the Department of Defense formed a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence that seeks to include partners from industry and academic community, and the White House announced the formation of an Election Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that sought to form a Commission of National Security for Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on state name change
Macedonian citizens voted in Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims their northern neighbour's name is the property of its territory and has vetoed their accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could jeopardise the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised questions about whether a 50 per cent minimum will go to the referendum to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliament members said they would be managed by the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 a.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when a total of 66% of voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Djos Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a Macedonian referendum on a name change, which could pave the way for NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of the tents that were crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they do not want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate higher than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote 'yes' because more than 80% of our population is for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the ballots were inserted.
He said the result of "yes" would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says it will participate between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters -- below the necessary turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they'd vote yes.
A 50 per cent turnout plus one vote is needed to make the referendum successful.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-West government since it came to power last May.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling got rid of Brighton's defense in a 2-0 Manchester City victory against Brighton at Ethichad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored the goal in 65 minutes.
Argentina's attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defense players, Brighton, before he found himself in the open field.
Aguiera was then surrounded by three green jerseys.
He pushed himself around one defense player and was faster than a few more on the edge of a naked Brighton.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English gunman used his first strike in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguerra, who, by right-hand digging, defeated the goalie Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the net.
"Aguero had some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers the initial advantage in the turmoil of the Premier League.
He scored a goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He added a beautiful Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sanne touched it several times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The skyscraper threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.
The city is fighting the Hoffenheims in the group phase of the Champions' League at 12:55 p.m. on Thursday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Cincinnati, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against Rockys
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the competitive Sherzer hopes to take a position Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in overplay.
At least the Rockies have a direct pass for a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win their first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, even if we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all these other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
Nationals are still due to announce a starting team for Sunday, but they are reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw in the situation.
Sherzer, who would have been 34th time to start a game, trained on Thursday and will throw on Sundays when he usually rests.
D.C.'s right-handed man leads 18-7 this season on the average of earned wounds of 2.53, 300 racks in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly looked back on the situation surrounding his candidate for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh,'s election, as he discussed the importance of getting Republicans out in the half-term elections.
"Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – although I did not actually run, I am a candidate because I am fighting everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to restore power using every possible means, you see evil, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to gain power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a "resistance and interference" mission.
"And you saw it in the previous four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, evil, evil and dishonest".
He cited a democratic senator and member of the Senate's judicial committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which prompted the audience to take a loud indignation.
"You remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting. It was really the bad language of the body, the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour Members who have been told that they are not welcome and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement from the Labour Party's branch meeting in Nottingham East on Friday reads "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member, Friday night meetings were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who I believed shared similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I would otherwise never agree with, whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's accompanied by a bunch of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, condemnations of the policy center and tell me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because comments directed to me are mostly political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal daily with a host of sexist or racist insults, but do not retreat.
Something that most disappointed me in this political age is how these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and by any voice of untrust or by changing the rules of selection the game is narrowing down.
I've been given a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been urging me to bow my head, be less loud, and then I'll be "okay."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by Prime Minister Thatcher's neglect that caused my primary school classroom to literally collapse, I have sought to advocate better public services to those most needed, whether as a local councilman or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that when the country crashes to Brexit that will endanger households, jobs and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not to the Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threats by removing me from the party or from a political prank will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unused Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the deserved victory in this exciting game of the day at Tennent's Prime League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only ones undefeated by ten teams.
In the end, the home team won the victory thanks to superior defence, as well as the greater number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tested in matches and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Well done, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Naderson in the 14th minute that Frazier Climo turned, gave priority to Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo's penalty increased Ayr's leadership before, just before halftime, he achieved a solo attempt to hit for a 17-5 score for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose's second half began well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break because of a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the stretchers, and Ayr further increased the advantage of the attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair MacPherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose re-exploited the numbers with Bruce Colvin's unconverted attempt after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts also returned when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card because of the foul over the Clem without the ball. MacPherson reached touch down from the penalty line behind the upcoming mall Ayra.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow to the penitentiary area and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt at host.
Still game series star ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Star of the Still Game, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the catering industry after learning he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes scripts for and plays along with his longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming season nine would be the last in the series and it appears that Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although Scottish Sun's source suggested Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the sea headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings, ocean blue flags are winded.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are sealed with slogans: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty."
Throughout the coast of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory of the coast they lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict over natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the longing to set sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1st after five years of the Council.
"Bolivia has caught a rush, in the spirit of unity and clearness, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favour of Bolivia and claims that – after decades of cramping negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here is Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who is about to have a controversial fight for next year's reelection, also has a big role to play in Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is made only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of making progress in Bolivian cases, the last four years may have put him back.
"The problem of the exit to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold these negotiations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "set an end to 139 years of disagreements on mutual satisfaction", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the issue of exit to the sea as a political crutches.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not abolish nuclear weapons until they trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honour promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicting leaders.
His comments arrived at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the border to restart the dead nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Una of North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is general skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of the Pyongyang in terms of giving up the nuclear arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare Kim and Trump's second summit.
The Paris fashion show presents the latest lines of huge hats that you will soon see in a nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer exhibitions 2019, shadowing everyone in Paris's Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on fashion runways.
The most prominent Valentine's Day piece was a over-imposed hat with a wide feathered border that swallowed the heads of a model.
Among the other bulky accessories there were watermelons with decorative stones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had our lips wet and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other one resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you are lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The giant hats came after "La Bomba", a straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that came up with this very impractical hat that flooded social networks sent on the runway another big creation – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that wore it.
Zagasitonranjska bag of refinery with grills and white leather lunch was highlighted details of Jacqeumus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity styleists Luke Armitage said about FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for next summer, as the designer has made such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-named fashion accessories."
John Edward: Language Knowledge Is Key to World Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland can be praised for outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding results on exams, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, a selected career and a place in the society of the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curricula and programme, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable electoral subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands, that's a good idea for him.
If you talk to him in his language, it makes his heart feel better."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the exams this year, we can see that the languages at the top are league tables, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received A in the final exam of high school.
Data collected from the 74 school members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received A from Mandarin language in the high school finals, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish, also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in independent school programmes, and elsewhere.
A poll conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that employers cited in the difficulty of filling jobs are precisely a lack of those who know foreign languages.
Hence, knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in the world of globalisation.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they know another language, they will have a real advantage in the future because it is a skill for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to the YouG survey conducted among more than 4,000 British people in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
As a result, investing in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be several languages of which he will be able to choose in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that languages are key to the country's future in the global business environment, so this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people of Scotland.
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

LeBron will debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked for plans at six games during the Lakers pre-season.
"In this stage of my career I do not need pre-seasonal matches to prepare," he said.
Trump assembly in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five appointments in the next week including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting his vote to fill the posts in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight in Eastern Time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia under a live feed on YouTube.
Trump will likely be talking about hearings this week regarding Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which it was tensed by sexual harassment charges, and the expected vote in the Senate was postponed by seven days until the FBI conducted an investigation.
But the predominant goal of this series is to help Republicans achieve a better result in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that meetings this week are being held to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel as many states as possible to enter the election campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign that refused to present itself told Reuters.
An appointment at the Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it will be the second time this month Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, who doesn't look good in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his ratings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows combatability to keep hope ahead of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the fours on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of the slaughterhouse is a fully invented concept in sports, but one of the players who truly believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think's got a swing right now?
"They ran six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his departure.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points higher, with twelve more in the game.
The Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there are many things that give them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each took three points out of the four possible.
Spieth was great from the first to the last punch and led by his example.
Celebrations grew louder during his round, to eventually play a key hit for the draw in the fourth match when he and Thomas lagged behind two after two.
His final blow to the 15-hole match was met with a similar shout, one that reflected the belief that the American team had hope.
"You simply must do your best and take care of your match," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but adorable European couple won all four matches and played without error.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't play punches on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far is also the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience, they've solidified it in the position of top favorites on Sunday, and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could win a potential European victory as the sun sets over the Le Golf National Courts.
The best thing would be both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergi Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he played couple with Alex Noren.
One god shot and two doubles in the first nine holes buried a Spanish and a Swedish in a hole from which they couldn't even come to the end.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours are so fascinating to watch closely because of interactions between couples, tips they give and do not give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage over the final day, but this session of four has also shown that the US team has a desire to fight which some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 a.m. the last day Ryder baths
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant head start, as after Saturday's match with four balls and fours, it has gained an advantage of 10:6 above the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took the first with two victories over the indisposed Tiger Woods, increasing the result so far on Le Golf National's field to four points.
The Europeans of Thomas Bjorn in the fight to win back the trophy they lost at the Hazeltina golf club two years ago, dominated the unaccounted for Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States has given more resistance to the four tournament, winning two matches, but could not cut back.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points in 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, is only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they were brilliantly teamed up and overcame tired Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, flashed for moments, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to his partner Henry Stanson at the four tournament and suffered a defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Yet, Europe did not go according to the plan of this pleasant clear day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tournament set a two-point goal for the Americans on Saturday.
They fought the 2-1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to later return and defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in four, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has a team returned after four points behind the individual matches, although Furyk's side defending the title is a sufficient draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it appears that they would not be able to counter Sunday's attack.
North Korea reports "no speech" on unilateral disarmament unless there is trust
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister said that the extension of sanctions deepens its mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the UN's annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant measures to show goodwill", such as nuclear and missile testing interruptions, nuclear polygon decommissioning and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no talk about the first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's resistance to "stepping" the denuclearisation approach under which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the importance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denucleisation from the game as Pjongyang had previously done.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the US current president and North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up ‘denuclearisation first of all’ and increase the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by force, opposing even ‘the declaration of the end of the war’," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can throw us on our knees is the dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If we were negotiating this problem of denuclearisation with South Korea rather than with the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not come into such an unexplainable position."
However, the tone of Rio's speech differed dramatically from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that the shooting of U.S. land by North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "the rocketman" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council sanctions must continue strictly and without letting them be implemented until full, final, confirmed denuclearisation is reached."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in an effort to disable the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with words that progress had been made, and North Korea sentenced him only a few hours later for making "gangster's demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "responsible measures".
He said Kim told him that "response measures" required by security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students into more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho learning culture "all night long with caffeine".
One academic noted that the world’s leading university students are often ignorant of basic care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course he considers to be the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to initiate this course was given after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one has ever told her how important the dream is – which surprised me," The Telegraph told him.
This year's first course gives students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as improving their general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university had decided to introduce a course after students were noticed to suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the room in the student dorm and students should click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of routine before bedtime.
In the second part, participants were told that a long-term lack of sleep could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects there is a decision to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
A culture of pride over the "awaken night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing lack of sleep becoming a problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and quality, should be "secret weapons" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, as the result of lack of sleep makes the brain starve, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler set a course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all graduates to pass a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students think about setting the alarms in time for sleep and awakening and take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emits electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the Circadian rhythm, and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressing defeat in their guests when Dolly Menga shot Steven Gerrard to defeat 1-0 of Livingston.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win first after February's 4-1 triumph in St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team made Gerard the manager of only a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unreachable leaders of the Ladbrokes League Prime Minister, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspiring Rangers lineup never came anywhere near the evening.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingstone climbed third and the Hibernias were only behind because of the goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after a line judge named Calum Spence had to be helped when he was thrown aside by a case.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that outdid Ayr and placed herself in the batfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt opted for the same eleven Livingstone players who took a point to the Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone took better advantage of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to score a goal just two minutes after Menga first added to the empty space sending Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfield player missed a big chance and kicked off the goal.
The deep free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to kick past the goal, end of the stand.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their last-third game gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have gotten a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers scored only two hits on the goal in the first half, but former goalie Ibroxa, Liam Kelly, without major problems defended the blow with Lassane Coulibaly's head and tamed the shot sent by these Ejarias.
Although the first goal of Livingston in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship of force in the game, no one can argue that it was deserved, if nothing else, then because of the effort.
The Rangers couldn't fight Jacobs with a deep free shot again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga as a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately yielded the result when a wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly came running from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingstone continued to get guests to play exactly as it suits them, with long balls Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was good at holding up and defending Jacobs' attack, so then Lithgow sent the ball out of the corner with his head next to the goal.
Deputy Rangers player Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor · Global Voices
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882 on this day 136 years ago... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become a device known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the main strongholds of science, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 Bell of Coronada, in which the seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, it's a crackpot!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and then kill them.
Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure involves the extraction of immune cells from patients and their modification in the laboratory
They can thus "see" a protein that is common in many types of cancers and then re-injection.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovary of a woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, the modification of them in the laboratory so that they can "see" HER2 protein and re-injection them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancers" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immunological cells from patients and the "teaching" of the same cells to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a tough support speech to Trump, wearing a MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL.
Didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was staged in a studio during Saturday Night Live after an audacious performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat titled "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
"So many times I've talked to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee regarding allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the public that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They teased me!
And then they say I'm down," Washington Examiner said.
The West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?", adding that "they'll wear Superman's cloak because that means you can't order me.
"Try love."
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL's show team were visibly embarrassed, Variety conveyed, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio is completely silent."
They brought West in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many by performing a song I love it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not stepping down in front of the abusers."
But Karen Hunt's host tweeted that the West was simply "what he truly was and that it was absolutely beautiful."
"But I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he embraced and spread the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now "be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to symbol, and then into "artist previously known as Prince".

The charges will be discussed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the series "Table Games", Kit Harrington, condemned a toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats with a sword in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) collapsed on the stereotype of macho heroes, saying such roles on screen mean that boys very often think they should be rude to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture at the time #MeToo.
The whale who recently married a partner from the Game of Thrones, Leslie Rose, 31, admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I am personally rather troubled by the question – what did we do wrong with representing manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading toxic macho culture because of the depiction of characters that appear to be male.
He continued: "What is innate and what is a matter of rearing?
What is it they teach us on TV and on the streets that make young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think it's actually one of the main issues of our era – how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people."
In the interview, he also admitted not to agree to the sequels or sequels of the Game of Thrones after its completion next summer, saying he "had finished fighting fields and horses".
Since November, Keith will be starring in a Sam Shepard True West theatre piece, a story about a film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened in the game of the throne.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the part of Ygritte, the love partner of the whale's character Jon Snow in this fantastic show that won the emmy award.
A couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change from the previous situation.
In the past HIV has usually spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of virus-infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT has been widespread.
Studies estimate that due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff published data on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiring theories"
US MP Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff posted personal data from three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
A Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that the claims were made by experts and websites of the "Ultradesc wing".
"Lying, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network Thursday, released by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate commission hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came out at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication is connected to the Waters office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect claims – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie."
The statement by Waters soon provoked a conviction on the internet, also issued by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is escalating with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament needed for a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't be impertinent.
He can't question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of acting too furiously at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who has been running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also appeared on Twitter.
"The big deal if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and to answer before the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous for all my staff members".
Film review Johnny English again in action – a young spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can be applied to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with the sequel "Johnny English: Reborn".
Will the ironic autosats about how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, the glum, incompetent Johnny English rubber face got a new chance to blow something up – where his name more than anything tells us that it's a general comedian creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose English is not the native language.
It is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries little Clouseau, a speck of Mr. Bean and a little bit of that guy who played only one note in the theme tune of the performance of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also originally based on a passenger and an international man covered by the veil of a secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclay TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest JE venture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knight's armor and the rotor's knives briefly rang about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission are self-convincedly adding comical elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English aren't as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's German film-style gegs in Mr Bean's image.
Now it's a very current topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the horror of agents on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a crowded glass of water for the prime minister, a pompous and depressed character who is already experiencing a complete failure due to a fall in political popularity: Emma Thomson has played this character in a maestro fashioned model on Theresa May, but the script is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the smudged Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially lectures on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegs when English holds the Academy of Spying in the film's "Student Rock" manner.
Englisha quickly returns to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to reassemble it with formerly overwhelming partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin for blowing things up are again at the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and happiness to the beautiful fatal wife of Opheli Bullet, who is interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odysseus of comic events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, real chaos sneaking on Volta's luxury yacht and English starts a real anarchy trying to get acquainted with the interior of the Voltina house using virtual reality headphones.
It is obvious that a great effort has been made in this final sequence, but no matter how sweet and cheerful, the whole film is made for children.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with other Johnny English movies, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with any role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
Labour party denies making a plan for British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to transfer the time they save thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "accompanie" the party's economic programme and plans to improve labour conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Union Congress as a way in which workers can exploit a changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's economic rebalancing approach in favour of workers, as well as a party industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The opposition's chief John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his view of the Socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take over power from the hands of the "insecure directors" and the "professor" of the utility companies.
The opposition chief's plans also mean that the current owners of water supply companies may not recover their entire investment because laborers could impose "deductions" on the basis of the perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and to create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10% of the value of private sector companies to employees who are likely to raise annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy speaking for the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and is calling off the question of whether an investigation by the Bureau could force some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent for the 60-minute show Scott Peley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be bewildered.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a fierce accusation would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has energetically denied it," Graham added, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will bring together tens of thousands of people on the great lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates poverty eradication by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, phone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of the citizen of the world with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-called "clitivism" – when people believe they did something that would change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world have claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have advocated a range of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and political directions worth more than 37 billion dollars and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements arising from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, a partnership of investors and realisers from Great Britain who have promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", promising that Rwanda will allocate $35m to care for the end of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition become a historical footnote," said Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ulman, visitors to a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced it would finance the Food Power Project, whose interventions would touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world says, "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all major civil rights movements and against apartheids before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – Secretary of the Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of Interior, was discovered and transferred by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – namely, they are there at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure, together with our navy, that marine corridors remain open or block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organised by the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less composed of the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, saying Russia owns only one asset, and its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements are coming after Trump's administration mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump, would make Berlin a "secure" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars and which should double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economical and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The US's position has triggered a reaction from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Alliance of the German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Alliance of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" the presidential candidacy for 2020, said state senator Massachusetts
State Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "really consider" running for president after the next medium-term elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in the town of Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running for office.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," The Hill's source said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall, saying he "is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been called for criticism directed to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet published on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of Thursday's poll showed that most of the electoral bodies that voted for Warren do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The poll showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48 per cent against candidacy.
Other sound names from the Democratic Order discussed in terms of their potential 2020 bid are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talked about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's support rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after Monday night's incident
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, can be linked to what is happening to other families who suffer the consequences of the PTSD and the vulnerability with which our soldiers are returning," she told the public at an expensive support to President Donald Trump in the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a burning topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, she added, "they come back a little different, they come back tighter, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots have given for this country," and all the other military members gave for the country."
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence -- assaulting a female person, obstructing domestic violence and possession of opiate weapons, according to what Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Administration, said.
18 countries, D.C. supports contesting new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a review of the new US policy that deprives asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District submitted a friendly report to the court in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the US Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She's been held in custody in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace explained that the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
A new US asylum policy annulled the 2014 immigration appeal committee's decision to allow non-document-free immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Prosecutor District Columbia General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," the friendly report said.
Lawyers further argue in the report that the police that prevent immigrants from entering are harming the US economy, and that they will likely become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
State prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases related to migrants in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their countries of origin for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or for their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of June 11th on politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to mitigate all problems, even all the serious problems people around the world face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Ris Kusum by comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the desolate town of Palo.
"Emergency services are brought to the bodies every minute.
The government lacks clean water."
The residents return to their broken homes, search for flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-degree earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, are stationed outside Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being helped outside due to continuing severe side earthquakes.
His eyes are full of tears as he talks about how he felt a strong earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think the ruins of the wall pressed me," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of committing "violence with propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper Daily praising the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the paid addition of China Daily's Chinese newspapers to the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections to be held on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marks what US officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign run by Washington to pressure China.
And while it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where each other is increasing tariffs on imports.
In contrast, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were aimed at exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supports Trump's Republican Party, said in Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and formerly longtime mayor of Iowa State, who is China's main exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the newspaper Des Moines Register Sunday, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By expanding its propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, placing a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at a kiosk located down the streets of Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on the problematic economic path of China, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm rod of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most dynamic Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although it did not state what newspaper it was about.
Republicans deter women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts warned that a number of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand next to a candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions that relate to this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to cast their voice.
There is no going back in these things," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article for a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon)'s last-minute request to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate's corridor, while Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told news.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among the indecisive women's voters in the suburbs and in younger voters between 18 and 29, who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she presented details of the alleged sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts were of the opinion that there could be negative reactions if Republicans persisted with the appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," the NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, as saying earlier this week.
"It is not just the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with the issue and how they treated it," he stressed for the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities Group USA, who supports the election of Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, which makes it easy to lean aside from Kavanaugh.
The new YouG survey shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they felt the same way about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh in a drunken state attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez reportedly claims that a candidate for a Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals while attending the party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform called Solid, which is designed by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive internet for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal data store online or POD (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on users who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is to provide Inrupt with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of employees of development engineers hired to work on the project and the volunteer programmer community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their overnight business models will be completely destroyed.
"We're not asking their permission."
In an announcement Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Although it runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Open Data Foundations and Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration about Victoria's cross awarded to a priest in World War I
Celebrates in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was awarded Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War , was arranged in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won a confession on 29 September 1918 for an attack on the cities of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the greatest British military recognition.
On Saturday's parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial board.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Queen Canal "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire with a battlefield and a machine gun."
Later, he hurried to the fire line, and with "the greatest heroism", led the platoon forward before he ran to the Polish cannon without anyone's help and cut down three of the military squad.
Colonel Vann was executed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes obedience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also passed a wedding after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band tobacco orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, get Pepa Pig instead
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to make it impossible for you to watch the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and appeared live during the night on Channel 5 channel in Britain.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained appalled when Pepa Pig was interrupted.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until early morning just for fighting.
A Twitter fan described this break in cartoon transmission as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is a government regulation that says that at 6am this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, on the transfer issue.
"Pepa Pig," yes.
Bellator President Scott Cocker said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about reruns, I think we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to realise anything until Sunday comes to us, when they will have it Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a break-up, there were correspondences and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” because of sexuality
The Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
A 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs to represent Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular head of a longtime programme, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of the disease.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, these feelings of less value and the feeling of being different were the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medals has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, US producer Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 "surprised."
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, and said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you experience so much while you're so young," he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple came true as the parent of Robert Black-Dalley's boy in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only that "I must win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- swimming in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was an inspiration for his choice of first song - Proud of Heather Small - who answered it as he was preparing for the Olympics and from which he was still being swept away.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he's gonna play his 47th at the Ryder Cup, but he's gonna have to get his form back so this won't be an unhappily turning point.
Mickelson, who plays on the 12th time record, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench in Saturday's four-balls and four-ball game.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time main winner spent a day cheering and improving range in the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the height of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding Le Golf Nationala course, where a long uneven terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesca Molinari, on the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, get to the hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes in himself very much.
He is a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine he was playing two games.
I imagined there would be more of them, but that's how it worked, and we thought that's how it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of ryder Cup matches played.
It could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence had brought certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the single match Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a match played in the town of Valderram in 1997, when the side whose captain was Seva Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a narrow difference of 14°-13°.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderram, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," said Bjorn, conceived after watching the team in 2018 who won the score 5-3 on Friday and led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field yesterday.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win this trophy and keep it focused.
All the time I've been talking, I've focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
Delighted by the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
There are individual games tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you test the extreme possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players - do the best you can tomorrow.
You're leaving your partner now, and he also has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of these major shifts on the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When he starts with such a rush, he creates a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We formed our own lineup accordingly and we prepared the boys so we could try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counter-attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think it can cover all the way," Bjorn said about selecting a single player.
New German warship on hold again
A new frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace aged warships from the Cold War, but will not arrive for at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz," the leading ship in the brand-new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted by the military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after the delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg Navy, which were ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen frigates.
As far as it is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to schedule the latest frigates for up to two years without returning to the ports of origin.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which should have allowed Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time they start to use, according to Die Zeit.
An unfortunate frigate F125 arrived last year in the newspaper, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after the delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the ship, if deployed to a combat mission, unusable.
Software shortages were of particular importance because the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by crews of some 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who managed the old Bremen frigates.
Also, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy to reduce its effect and restricts the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy is in fact " running out of ships that can be deployed."
The official said that this problem has grown over time, as old ships have been written off and no replacement ships have been purchased.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on a property in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use landscapes in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will accompany ordinary bats and soprano species, and brown long-haired bat and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be installed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The professional analysis of all records will determine the frequency of bat calls and what types they do.
A map of habitats and reports will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for nature conservation at NTS, hopes that the results will show what areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and what is the best way to maintain bat forests and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by works on construction and development, which have a negative impact on litter and habitat loss.
Windwinds and lighting can also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are far more beneficial than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, bed inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even founded the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a large area of bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all good habitats.
But there is still so much unknown about bats, so what we are doing here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses the importance of checking if the bats are on the property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother’s litter kills up to 400 females and young women, likely to result in the extermination of the entire local population.
The bats are protected by animals and the law prohibits them from killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, has encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how the population of most of our species is developing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers file lawsuits against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges as "false news," saying people "want to be promoted" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Derbach, who released the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her 375,000 dollars afterwards to keep this incident quiet, Dermichael reported on Friday.
Addressing his companions, who were 142 million in video on Instagram Live, hours after the charges report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports by calling them "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's fake news," said the camera's five-time Golden Ball winner.
"They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get the glory of talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Dermichael over these allegations, which they called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "immaterial damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents delivered to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled on his knees after an alleged incident and told her that he was a "99% good guy" who was failed by those "1%)."
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and photographed her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she's now seeking a cancellation of the settlement because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing over to Real Madrid from Manchester United at a time when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he went to Italian giant Juva for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK Will Always Sorry It Lost Car Producers · Global Voices
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses the world's leader status in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that what Toyota UK said about BBC is "worrisome" if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at borders in case Bexit runs out of agreement could cause job losses.
The plant in Burnaston, made by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other producers from the UK including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on the "right on time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU for cars made per order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there can be a break at the border which can lead to delays and shortages of parts in industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC 4 programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but also of other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what was an extremely successful series of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be suspended, but warned that long-term additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the Union Union Union union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this close, they never return again.
The government spokesman said, "We must put forward a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" because the fight continues over the candidate for Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in elections, ties between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, thus jeopardizing Mr. Mueller's independence, has been the subject of speaking in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of rescheduling the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, amid rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Justice Commission hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week on Friday, delaying the Senate's vote in full.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News channel Sunday.
She answered the question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been established, it could be this week, and could be delayed for another week considering all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders has not held a brief address for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a small number of short addresses are not the result of the "theatrical behavior" of TV journalists, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
Then she said there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without stating evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it as much as possible and you have seen us do it over the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace short addresses to journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences when officials visit.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the crowded journalists unbridled and occasionally strange.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about fears related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude for the state and their desire to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeanne Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the costs of settled requirements for the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue during the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know for all of you this has been a very uneasy time.
That's why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide colleagues also bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefit patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie under emergency surgery after head trauma
Defence team player State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after hurting his head on Saturday's defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the field line and simply collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on a stretcher and took it to further interrogation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed his operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/scale of injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red jersey, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total shootings on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged higher real estate fees in the UK
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Greater taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to £120 million annually -- to help the homeless
Foreign customers will be charged higher fees when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless, published today by Theresa May.
This step will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbin by seeking to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing care and focus on those who earn more.
Greater taxes will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay UK taxes, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight outdoor sleep.
The additional fee, which, besides the existing tax, including higher levels, was imposed two years ago on other real estate and purchases for rent, could be as much as 3%.
The vault expects the move to increase revenue to £120m annually.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not have UK residence, which is why prices are rising, and customers who first buy real estate are getting harder to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson called for taxi cuts to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused construction firms of holding high prices of real estate by buying the first land they did not use, and asked Mrs May to give up the affordable house quotas as soon as possible to end Britain's "a disgrace to housing policy".
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of renting and suspension of nothing caused by deditions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said I would dedicate my mandate to the prime minister to restore the British dream - that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses as easily as the British do.
The dream of ownership of the house has become far too far for many people, and inhuman sleep in the open still remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
The 40-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of the club from the northeast, which currently ranks third in the First League, with three points less than the lead.
This summer he moved to Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was on the B-team and that was it," Ross said for the show Sportsbound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sanderland include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former club chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel restless because he comes after such big names to such a big club, after refusing to offer the Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this point will be 'will I be able to return this club to the Prime Minister's League?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the prime league," he said.
"It is not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I will be able to consider myself successful only if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross was only in the third year of his management career, after spending a period as assistant chief in Dumberton and 15 months spent as part of the training staff of Harts.
Then he helped Allo recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren dragged him off the edge of falling into the lower league to the champions' winner next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled taking over the Allo Club.
"I honestly believed that management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living and enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to be in management and now I've been doing it, in my whole adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I am now."
You can listen to the whole interview on Sunday, September 30, on the Radio of Scotland from 12:00 to 13.00 British Summer Time
The perfect time for a cup is Saturday at 5:30, revealing research.
The summer heat wave has increased British pub traffic fighting for survival, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, sales growth of 2.7% was achieved in July, but restaurant traffic fell 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant company, who collected data, said: “Long-term sunny time and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup contributed to a similar pattern following July as the previous month of June, when pubs grew 2.8%, and restaurants had an even greater fall.
The decline in traffic in restaurants of 1.8% in June only deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drink have achieved far the best result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than was the decline in restaurant traffic.
The pubs focused on food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sale of drinks was increased by 6.6% per month, with a three per cent drop in food sales."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment Content and Hostage of RSM, said: “These results continue with the trend we have been witnessing since the end of April.
Weather opportunities and the impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors when it comes to sales on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the decline in sales of 4.8% on the annual level will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time would show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little needed relief."

Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from their parents and teachers, reveals research.
A survey involving over 20,000 primary school students revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
That news has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account showing their parents
Every fifth child, of whom only 11 years of age, makes orders on social networks that he hides from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 upper-school students revealed a rapid increase in the "false Insta" task, which refers to the Instagram photo sharing site.
That news heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "principal" account showing parents, but also had private orders.
One mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who calls others "rape me."
A study conducted by the UK's Digital Consciousness and Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said, "It disturbs the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athlete" on the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals, including 200m and 400m in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC expert, remained immobilised after having suffered a transit ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could show if I would recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertises for a traitor in which mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that manufactures traitors shared opinions on the Internet by comparing the suckler with the milk cows.
To mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent traitor", Elvie's consumer technology company has published a commercial inspired by a fun music video showing freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn between the hay and the cows with a song that reads, "Yes, I'm married but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a wink, it's my breasts."
Here comes the chorus: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself."
However, a commercial published on the company's Facebook page has triggered controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions by viewers, while many said it sheds light on the "horrible" dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and have the same birth as we do to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't we use it to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else said, "It makes no sense to me."
Others stood up for the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "urnegation".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I was still breastfeeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I figured it out right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a ridiculous commercial aimed at mothers who betray milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or saves the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely inaudible, has no wire, no pipes and stops in the breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go out while they're giving out milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between the suckler and the milk cow, we wanted to focus the milk issue and all the challenges that go along with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made newspaper headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Yakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it difficult to find guardians for children.
Traditionally, most guardians themselves were migrants without documents who were afraid to jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by stepping up to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, senior Immigrant and Customs official, told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not previously been convicted.
"Nearly 80% of people who are either guardians or members of the guardian's household are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we'll keep looking for these people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers at the shelter said.
Many will make a video call instead of a personal call, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who are found not to meet the requirements will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain locked up, the greater the chances of becoming anxiety or depressed, which could lead to an outpouring of anger or attempted escape, say the workers of the shelter and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks have been raised in larger institutions such as the one in the town of Tornillo, where size makes it much easier to overlook signs that the child has problems.
They added that moving children into a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally in the Syrian country, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "the war against terrorism is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "a sacred fight until we have wiped out all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in charge of training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for "expanding irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a massive attack by Syrian forces supporting Russia in the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and fighters from the front of the Nusra linked to al-Qaeda, which would "be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the opposition authorities and members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare a path to elections.
Moualem outlined the government's conditions for participation in the committee's work, saying the work of the body should be limited to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be elected for second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, recall and scandal earlier, his mandate is interrupted.
This would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic end to the presidential mandate of all time!"
So far, there's no indication of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the strike rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to the Nielsen agency, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the show Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC exceeded the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with breaking news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama producer "The Chosen Survived" on ABC channel, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few harsh truths about getting into a club of Hollywood boys", has a different theory.
She remembers taxi rides in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos also has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories that come from Washington can decide the future of abortion law from the Roe v. Wade case, whether the immigrant families will be able to connect and what the state of the global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you watched a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear," about the jacket of Paul Manafort of Noah's skin worth $15,000 (the suit with a thick lining of pods," wrote Washington Post), and the implications of picturesque descriptions, uh, anatomy, Mr. Trump, given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Maria again with the same eyes.
"Part of what he makes you feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Publishery", commenting on the rotation of the cast and daily complications of Trump's show (critical of the American Football League, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleissa this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27 °C), but he closed himself inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate's Judicial Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large inflows of money from the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent end of the county's borders in Pittsburgh's suburbs led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who headed the second district after last spring's snap elections.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favour of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign fight between the main party fund-raising parties, the Committee that raises funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broad-viewed special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District in March.
That position was held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with a 20-point head start.
Political analysts gave a minor advantage to the Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrawing
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, in a statement early this month.
But the fines were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140m in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include reducing financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would be difficult to hit the Central American country with a high unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was to be the continuation of a similar annual meeting that was a step forward in efforts to prevent the inflow of migrants into the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus effectively interrupted any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next item could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on the possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which now has significant evidence in the public files.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to reveal a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's attack on elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he's preparing to re-enter voters and perhaps even a jury.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, only that the West would stand up to him and support the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now facing several such breaking points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unenviable position since he reported last year that he proposed a covert shoot of the president and raised speculation that he was not fit to perform his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times statement is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will call to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter sleep.
But I don't think we're going down because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid in Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over Austrians, after an impressive remium in Spain against Villarrell early this month, would put them in a good position to qualify from the G League group.
The knee injury prevented a binding player named Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until an unsolved match with Willareal's final score of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone for further action.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with a point.
We may have been able to take them to the end, but all in all, the unsolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we are expected again by a big European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, although with the support of the audience we can certainly push and achieve a positive result.
Last year was no doubt difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries to the changes in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we've got right now.
The team's in good shape and the boys really enjoy it; we're training well.
I hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep with worry about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the subjects had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with members of their families.
About half of the people covered by the Nationalwide survey said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said they talked about it with their children.
"People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on the subject," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at the Nationwide company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Cooperate with your counselor and family and consider where and how to provide him, for such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your consultant can help you and figure out a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care financing choices can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you cover these costs or self-securing with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the root.
Make it possible for you to make medical assistance decisions to have an authorized person of trust who will oversee the medical care provided to you and to ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the conclusion of a contract of power of attorney for finance.
This involves choosing a person out of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and care about paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Don't forget the little details: imagine that your elderly parent finds himself in a situation where he needs emergency medical attention and takes him to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details of the plan in writing to be ready.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with multiple shots from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with multiple gunshots from an air rifle as he walked home from his evening out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 British summer time as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
As communications broke down, the relief officers could not obtain any information from the province of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of a 7.5 - degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district that is administratively lower than the province had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit Western Donggal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The Great Earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of the Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatara.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populous Indonesian island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatara, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake hit the Pidia Jay region in Aceh, causing collapse and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquakes and tsunamis.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remain temporarily trapped.
The eldest son of Sara Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, former governor of Alaska's eldest son and vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of having committed domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence and resisting arrest, a report published by the Alaska State Police Agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su detention unit and was granted a $500 bail, according to the KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he pleaded "not guilty", the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he's facing a prison sentence for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B violation, which is being punished by a prison sentence of one day and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
This isn't the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power supplies have been cut off, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesia, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck of Home Depot to launch attacks on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, bringing down pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to a request for death sentences, submitted in the southern New York district.
At both points, it is possible to pronounce the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullajevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," according to a request for a sentence.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last had a case where death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The final death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed on June 19th 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of acquittal, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel dissatisfaction" with eurosceptics, since one of the MEPs Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
conservative representative Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "outed" by now that Mr. Farage was secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in an attempt to unite her deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who advocated staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that it proceed with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting to go means to go to Solihull that he wants to "refuse the Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
The ambassador from Wellingborough added, "I'll fight for Brexit, but we need to get Chequers out."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their minds and wanted to remain completely incorrect."
A supporter of Brexit Andrea Yankees, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a sharp message to Mrs May, she added, "The Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel dissatisfaction" if they are about to let down a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "it won't work".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of the issue of Brexit, to feel dissatisfaction.
"We are mobilizing the nation's army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-administered, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved "Torici v. Brexit" banners after forming a group this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people telling us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the uninterrupted state of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren's planning on seriously considering running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts patriot was talking about her future during a participatory meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, again ran for the November elections against a Republican representative at Geoff Diehl's House of Representatives, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's at the centre of speculation so she can face Trump 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the electricians on which participatory meeting format was used since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to head to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the helm."
Arrested after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La, released Saturday's arrest of a shooting suspect in which a basketball player, LSU Wade Sims, was killed Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 P.M. at a press conference.
On Friday, video footage of the shooting was released, asking for help in finding a man who can be seen on video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus Southern University early Friday.
Wade Sims was shot in the head by what he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson hit him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon, and he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge County Police Station.
Junior of 6-foot-6 who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played 32 games last season with 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order guarantees him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of the teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel was the first to go to boxing and leave Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at the beginning, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action wheel of the wheel which unwittingly forced Ferrari's driver to leave a free interior at risk of lagging behind after a double move in defense of the third turn.
Max Verstappen began from the last row of bars and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran most of the race relying on his tires to get to the quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a rough day since Valteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and being a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve one or two formational finishes," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinsten at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify to Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, wicked and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and wicked and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and information that's leaked to the public, and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information to the public?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public-- no matter what?
Oh, no.
I'm not the one who let it go public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let...No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - yet Feinsten denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story go public." Feinstein told the board, Hill reports.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, like she asked."
But her denial did not come upon the approval of the president, who at the rally on Saturday night commented: Let me tell you, it was really a bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president insisted that the Democrats use these allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediaite conveys the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for losing the Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday by winning five to three in a back match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants initially took advantage of the two goals of Patrick Dwayne and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie had led domestically to equalization before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled for Dundee before two of Lucas Lunvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elte League season for the Adam Keef team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting in the two-party season, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwayne opened the match by hitting the fourth minute, 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilleier and doubled his lead four minutes later.
In a crowd at the beginning, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cawnie for equalization at 15:16.
Until the first break, Dwyer provided Giants with a second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The domestic team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalisation in measuring forces with a goal at 2737 minutes.
Cownie and Charles joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored the fifth goal in the middle of the final period to ensure his team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of the previous five matches, welcome Milton Keyneses in the next match Friday.
The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia declared a hero after he was killed by ensuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing trying to save their lives, Anthonyus Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Airport Sis Al Jufrey Palu, who was rocking hard.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was standing on the runway at the time.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He passed away later at the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpan, Kalimantan, to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our heart is breaking because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state's disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is believed to continue to increase as numerous bodies remain below the ruins, and many cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching a height of up to six metres devastated Palu in which a mass burial would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Emergency vehicles drive bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hastily to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military of the state: I ask you all to work all day to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Minnesota: Air Niugini says that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota said one person was missing after it announced earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members had certainly been evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Niugini's statement states that since Saturday afternoon they are unable to trace the passenger.
The airline states that in co-operation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they are working to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and what the exact sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy announced that the plane ended up in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew over the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to make it to the emergency exit through the water that went up to the plane's sinking waist.
He said the crew was panicking and yelling, and he suffered head trauma.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the dock repairs also helped rescue using an inflatable boat that was transported to the coast before the plane went down to a depth of about 30m (100m).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered aircraft accidents over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution wrapped up the case Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Ministry analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he was using cell phone data to get a picture of the movements of defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which is contrary to his earlier claims, transmitted by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
Asking the prosecutor if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanphrod said he lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers had met about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett is that Tellis fixed time after Chambers' death from his phone erased her messages, calls and contact information.
He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin on Sunday with the closing statement.
The judge said he expects the jury's trial to follow later in the day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has strayed from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and return popularity to a conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and the Common are once again gaining popularity in the UK through artists like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
The New York nanny sues a couple for firing after a racist text message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for firing on a discriminatory basis after she got a text message from her mother by mistake complaining that she was another black person."
The couple deny being racist, assessing the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016, she realized that she was a new nurse for children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
NOEE another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly and was expecting a Filipino instead, transferred the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a fee for a day's work and picked up sent home.
Maurice is now suing a couple asking for compensation for discharge, as well as a 350-dollar-a-day fee for six months, on how originally she was hired to live with her family, although without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you cannot do such things," she said to the Post on Friday, adding that it is discrimination."
On charges of racism, the couple reciprocated that the cancellation of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they had offended her they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco, his husband, told Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you have offended, even if it was made by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Describing the lawsuit as an extortion," Plasco said his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and had been in a very difficult situation."
You're gonna chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behaviour and thinking.
Publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: It's hard to put herself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a book for children, would work for BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with both happiness and grief after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he did not like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, although it wasn't really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Though he was a figment of his imagination, he always credited all credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice after landing, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say it was bad, and they did not expect to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called to say that she'd die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just moments before that and everything went out.
All I could do was sit around and wait, knowing what was coming next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be collected."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now saddened by the death of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers who had never dreamed of the pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I got my head down, and my tears ran down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes set up cards on the Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide when he was 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
But before he died, he left work because he was in a very dark stage."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that it'll leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit there and keep your mouth shut. Talk."
Mrs. Humpreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was indisposed, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their gifts he didn't look them in the eyes or anything else."
She says that his death for them was a huge trauma, but that they must overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we'll keep going and fight."

With the FBI investigation open, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and scope -- maybe that would bring us together," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart" because of uncompromising party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is caused by the choice of the moment.
The congressional elections are held in just five weeks, November 6th, and if Republicans go badly, as expected, their attempts to get their man elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush made a phone call Saturday to the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court by his vote.
The number of defections from North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of defections from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the US Department of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug said 1127 defects were recorded last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs that smugglers charge.
Pyongyang didn't make a public call.
The vast majority of those who fled the north will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority runs across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers defections illegal migrants, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have improved noticeably in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped negotiations on denucleisation.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which a wider consensus was reached that they would work to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the current lack of progress.
Without confidence in the US, there is no trust in our national security either, and in such circumstances it is out of the question that we are the first unilaterally disarming ourselves," the RI said in an address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court hysterical," and said he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that would be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, assessing the allegations against him with a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" organised by the liberals to be angry that Hilary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform his post in the Supreme Court since it showed his bias at the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if he'd try to call Kavanaugh off if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got most of it in the House of Representatives, Pelosi gave way.
I will say the following - if he is not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he is not just like him in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he is now in," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of the District Court of Appeal, District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she is concerned about possible Kavanaughi rulings against the Law on Accessable Health or in the case of Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be placed in court and for us to be expected to say if it is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justifiable anger, anger that has been collected for months and years, and it cannot be solved without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere executive director, who said she was crying too when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that understood that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed to cast out anger partly and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office where men were mostly, is how, when I once cried for indescribable anger, an older woman - a cold boss who I was always a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me to the staircase.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on the Monteky Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that she had no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
That wasn't exactly a well-advised decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow White and seven Dwarves."
As the campaign had already moved forward, it lagged behind in fundraising, and she vowed not to enter the race unless she collected $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger over chauvinism - which made it hard for her to get her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembered how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would they put on my monument?
She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonadas of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is yet to be seen, the gap between countries in the long term can be of use to Beijing, experts argue.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning early this year by taxing key Chinese export products including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest blow occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion (150 billion), which practically tax half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing reciprocated each time with the same measure, with the latest introduction of tariffs from five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the second largest global economy seems to not to stop soon.
Force Washington to withdraw means meeting the demands, but public bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, US pressures in the trade war can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a steep economic downturn in one of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees," the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a war-torn country that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help rebuilding the broken country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the United States with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, initially threw a ball into the water at the 16th hole of a pair of three, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all rounds and became one of the four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost two to one to Ian Poulter from England, who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European winner of the tournament of all time with 25.5 points won in his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy we won the cup again.
Here is an important team and I am glad I could be of help," Emotion Garcia said after a European victory.
He's handing over his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in single matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record career of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the best players of all time who won 14 of the greatest titles and lags only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there were times when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
