Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were carried out.
Since then, China's economic size has increased 90 times.
Last year, China for the first time exported more cars from Germany and exceeded the United States as the largest car market.
Up to twenty years of China's GDP could be bigger than that of the United States.
The tropical storm, Daniel, the fourth known as hurricane season storm in 2010 in the Atlantic Ocean, was formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which developed about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum steady wind of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the National Hurricane Centre predict that by Wednesday Daniel will be a hurricane.
Since the storm is far from the drought, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the Caribbean swimming pool or the United States.
Bobek, who was born in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, became famous while playing for "partizan Belgrade".

People used chairs to hit the glass, but the windows didn't break.
The surviving Francisek Koval said that one of the windows finally broke and they started coming out the window."
Because of the energy generated by the unification of hydrogen atoms (or their merger) to form heavier elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve, and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthesis reactors.
The steel needle is held on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
The reason for the surface tension is that water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other rather than to air molecules above them.
Water molecules create invisible skin on its surface, which allows things like the needle to float from above.
The blade of the modern roller has a double edge with a dent in the middle. The two edges provide a better grip on the ice, even on a slope.
The edge that is in contact with the ice also bends as the lower part of the blade is slightly curved as it leans towards one side or the other.
This allows the skater to turn. If the skates turn left, the skater turns left if the skates turn right, the skater turns right.
They must get rid of the extra energy they receive from the light to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by radiating small particles of light called “photons”.
This process is called by scientists “stimulated radiation radiation” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing photons to emit, and light is a type of radiation.
The next photo shows photons of atoms. In fact, of course, the photons are much smaller than those in the picture.
The photons are smaller than the matter that builds the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, eventually the spiral in the bulb burns and it no longer works.
You need to be careful when changing the electric bulb.
First, the light-body switch or cable shall be switched off.
This is because the electricity that flows into the contact, where the metal part of the bulb is located, can cause a strong electrical shock. This can happen if you touch the inner part of the contact or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in contact.
The main organ of the blood system is the heart, which has a blood pump function.
The blood is removed from the heart by tubes called “arteries” and returns to the heart by pipes called “outs”. The smallest pipes are called “capillaries”.
Triceratops could chew with its teeth not only leaves, but also many hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, the triceratopes have eaten cicadas, which are a type of plant, common during the chalk period.
These plants are like tiny palm trees with a crown of sharp, barbed leaves.
The triceratops may have used his healthy hammer to peel the leaves before eating the stems.
There are also scientists who argue that these plants are very toxic and are unlikely to be eaten by any dinosaur, although today sloths and other animals such as parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would I be drawn to the gravity of Yo? If you step on its surface, you will weigh less than when you are on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds (16 kg) of Yo. Gravity, of course, will act less on him.
Unlike Earth, the sun has no crust on which you can set foot, all built of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas sinks away from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun that we see when we look at it is called "photosphere" or "the ball of light".
Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the Moon about 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The phases happen because only facing the sun side of Venus (or the moon) is lit up. The phases of Venus support Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Then, several years later, in 1639, the English astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed the transit of Venus.
England is going through a long peaceful period after Denlo's retake.
However, in 991, Etelred faced a Viking fleet greater than any other than the Guthrum century ago.

Hangul is the only targeted alphabet popular in everyday use. The alphabet was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejon (1418 – 1450).
King Séjon is the fourth and most respected king of the Joseon Dynasty.
At first, he called the "Hunmin Geongeum", the Hangeul alphabet, meaning "the right sounds for instructing people".
There's a lot of theories about how the Sanskrit came along, one of which is for the migrants from West Aryans who brought the language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the speeches in Europe Latin.
The earliest known book in the world is written in Sanskrit, after the complexion of the Sanskrit Upanishads, it just fades because of the hierarchy.
As Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has served as a source of many modern Indian languages.
With the end of the battle for France, Germany is beginning to prepare to invade the British island.
The code name of the attack on Germany is "Operation Siilion." Most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost when it was evacuated by Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German fleet (Kriegsmarine) and could have destroyed any enemy ships sent through Lamansha.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were stationed near the likely routes of invasion, as the Admirals feared they would be submerged by German air raids.
Let's start with the explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Japan and Germany.
There was a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although they had built four new ships just before the war began.
In order to conquer these countries, they had to own a platform so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
That's why it was necessary for them to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and besides these actions, Italian battleships had nothing to do with it.
Like Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long period of time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II. They were very slow then and had a very limited range of shooting sites.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate so that they would not be noticed, the submarines were forced to sail underwater.
The German submarines are called "seaboats". The Germans were very good at navigation and the management of their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after their war they are not trusted to own many of them.
Yes! King Tutancamon, sometimes called King Tut or "The King's Boy", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian Pharaohs of modern times."
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not recorded in most lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 turned him into a celebrity. Although many tombs from the past were robbed, it was left almost intact.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamon are well-preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rarely common stones.
The invention of speed wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows from their deadly arbats can penetrate the armor of rivals, about 1,000 B.C.E., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
Cavalry is an army fighting on a horse. The Assyrian Cavalry fought on the bare backs of its horses because the saddle was not yet invented.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Omir - the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems “Iliada” and “Odyssey” is probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Sophocles and Aristofan are still popular dramatists and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another well - known Greek is mathematician Pythagoras, most commonly known for his famous theorem about the links between the sides of the right triangles.
There are different assessments of how many people speak Hindi. It is believed to be between the second and fourth most commonly used language in the world.
The number of local speakers varies depending on whether the very closely related dialects are counted or not.
The approximate estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, but they are written differently; those in both languages can usually understand each other in everyday conversations.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
In their desire to bring God closer to local people, some German monks invented the Estonian literal language.
It is based on the German alphabet, adding a letter ‘
Over time, many words borrowed from the German language have come together. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
More traditionally, the heir to the throne enters the army directly after finishing school.

Learning to create interactive media requires common and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive classes (workboard, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate your perceptions of media production and learn to think non-linear.
Interactive design requires the components of one project to connect with each other, but also to make sense as a separate unit.
The focal complexity and the number of lens elements needed to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for ordinary lenses and this is the lack of zoom lenses.
This problem is becoming smaller as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This allowed the zoom lens to produce quality images, which is compared to that achieved with fixed-width lenses.
Another deficiency in the zoom lens is that usually the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is lower.
This makes cheap scale lenses difficult to use without lightning at low levels of light.
Among the most common problems in trying to convert film into DVD format is superscaning.
Most televisions are designed to satisfy the wide audience.
So all you see on TV is cut edges on the top, on the bottom and on the side.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called an image that exceeds the frame of the screen.
When you make a DVD, its ends, unfortunately, will most likely be cut off and if the video has translated too close to the bottom end, they will not be shown completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, shouting in mind images of tournaments, pirates and the knighted spirit of King Arthur.
Though standing among the thousands of years of ruins, it is not difficult to hear the sounds and smell the scents of long-ago battles, almost hearing the hooves of the hooves on the hooves and smell the fear rising from the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are the castles even built? How are they designed and built?
The Castle "Kerby McSlow" is typical of this period and more like a fortified house than a real castle.
The large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a decisive attack.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings embarked on her construction, the country was relatively peaceful and needed protection only against small groups of wandering marauders.
The balance of forces was a system in which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations should strive to prevent a nation from becoming strong, and national governments often change their unions to maintain the balance.
The first war, whose main issue was the balance of power, was the war for the Spanish heritage.
This marks an important change, since European forces no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years ’ War will be the last war called “religious”.
At the burning of Herostrate on July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at all costs to achieve glory. The angry Ephesians declared that the name of Herostrat would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later marks the name, and so we are known today. The temple was destroyed on the same night Alexander the Great was born.
In his capacity as king Alexander offered to take the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

It covers most of today's Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan is the civilization of Indus Valley, which is a bronze civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River region, where its name came from.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization also existed in the pools of the already dried Sarasvati River, it should be called the Ind-Sarasvati civilization, while some call it the Harapa Civilization, the first of its sites to be unearthed in 1920.
The development of medicine is supported by the military character of the Roman Empire.
Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to be used after the battles.
Surgeons knew different tranquilizers, including morphine extracts from poppy seeds and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They gain extensive experience in amputations to save gangrene patients, as well as the use of tourniquets and arterial blood flow stopwatches.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has led to enormous advances in medicine and has formed a great deal of our knowledge today.
Purland origami is an origami with the restriction that only one fold can be made at a certain point, more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple distortions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or people with limited motor skills.
Children develop a lot of understanding about race and racial stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with a racial minority, which is stereotyped as not doing well in school after learning about the stereotype associated with their race, usually do not do well at school.
MySpace currently has 54 million user profiles and is the third most popular website used in the US.
These websites have attracted much attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects that include the possibility of easily creating a class page that may include blogs, videos, photos and other functions.
You can get easy access to this page by providing only one web address that makes it easier to remember and write about students who would have problems using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized to read easily and also with a very or little color, as desired.
The attention deficit syndrome is a neurological syndrome whose classic triad of symptoms includes impulsiveness, a tendency to distract and hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a learning problem, but a school disorder; it “affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps 2 million American children. ”
Children with attention deficit syndrome (ADD) find it difficult to focus on school work, but can concentrate on things they like to do, play games or write sentences without a point, or watch their favorite animations.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because they “have risky behavior, go into battles and seek authority” to stimulate their brain, since their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The attention deficit syndrome affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they behave this way, or why they spell this way, or that their level of maturity is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learn has changed in the above manner, the basic speed at which knowledge is acquired has also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There is no longer any pressure within individual cancellation, now the focus is on the possibility of canceling the text.
Overall, during Renaissance, the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge changes significantly.
Unlike other primates, hominids are already using their hands to carry weights, swing on trees and move.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight when walking with a bone.
A man's hand has better phalanxes and is shorter than a foot.
Fossil bones of the arm from two to three million years of age reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to processing.
Some people believe that the frequent experience of many artificially induced conscious dreams can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that increase the time between fast eye movement states (REM).
With less REM per night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers, becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as tiring as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream clearly at night.
In North Africa, almost from the beginning things did not go well for the Italians. Within a week after the declaration of war from Italy on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hazaric regiment conquered Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
The British have captured the chief engineer of the Italian tenth army, General Lastucci, ambushed east of Bardia.
On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, general governor of Libya and heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire in carrying out a landing in Tobrook.
Modern sports fencing is practiced on many levels - from university students to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is practiced mainly in the form of a duel, with one fennel dueling with another.
When playing golf, players use sticks to hit balls to holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, with players usually starting from the first hole of the field and ending at the eighteenth.
The player who takes the smallest punches or bats to finish the track wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is cut low and it's called Greene.
Probably the most common type of tourism is the one that connects to travel by most people: recreation tourism.
When people go to a place that's very different from their normal everyday life to relax and have fun, we talk about it.
The beaches, theme parks and campsites are often the most visited places by holiday tourists.
If the purpose of the visit is to get to know history and its culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may consider different attractions in the country or choose to focus on only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonizers also called for backup.
The troops strengthening the front positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 people under the command of Colonels James Reed and John Stark (both later become generals).
On the fence at the north end of the Colonists position, Stark's men took positions.
When the tide opened a gorge along the stretch of the Mystic River River along the northeast peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the edge of the water on a small beach.
Gredley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) outside the fence and ordered that there be no shooting until the civilians passed.
The US plan envisioned coordinated attacks from three different countries.
General John Cadwolder would launch a deviating attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block possible reinforcements.
General James Ewing will cross the 700-strong river with the Trenton ferry, take the bridge over Asunpunk Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main storm squad of 2,400 will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one under Greene's command and one under Sullivan's command to take the attack before dawn.
With a change of running from a quarter mile to a half mile, the speed becomes much smaller until endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a top-class 800-metre runner, a person who can run the distance for less than two minutes, must have high speed, but endurance must be trained at any cost.
A few cross country runs in winter, combined with gymnastics exercises for the upper body, are the best preparation for the refugee season.
Only proper eating practices cannot produce excellent results, but can significantly affect the overall good health of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, they have effective hydration habits and understand the different aspects of the use of additives, athletes can improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sport.
There are many misconceived concepts regarding small equipment that is required to participate in the running of average distances, which is a relatively cheap sport.
If necessary, products may be purchased, but most of them will have little or no real impact on the result.
Sportsmen may feel that they prefer a particular product even when it does not bring them real benefits.
The atom can be viewed as one of the main building parts of the whole matter.
This is a very complex unit, which according to the simplified model of Bor consists of a central core and orbiting electrons around it, something similar to the planets around the sun - see Fig. 1.1.
The engine consists of two types of particles – protons and neutrons.
The protons have a positive electrical charge until the neutrons are gone.
Before you check the victim, first you need to look around and make sure you're safe.
When approaching the victim you need to notice his or her position and any automatic red flags.
If you get hurt while you're trying to help, you can only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and blackness interfere with the relationship between pain and disability in the lower back.
Only the consequences of disaster, not depression and fear, depended on regular weekly PA sessions.
The participants in the regular activity needed more support with regard to negative perception of pain, to distinguish the chronic pain from the feeling of discomfort in normal physical movement.
The vision or the ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye structures with different complexity according to body requirements.
Various structures have different properties, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing to make sense input data, as well as different numbers to work optimally.
The collection of specified species organisms within a geographical area is a population.
When all individuals in a population are identical with a phenotypic trait, they are defined as monomorphic.
Individuals are polymorphic when they demonstrate several variants of a particular line.
The colonies of ants-soldiers also march and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, the soldier ants march at night and stop camping during the day.
Once the available food is reduced, the colony approaches the nomadic phase. During this phase the colony makes temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic riots or hikes lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella”, meaning “small room”, and was originally created by a microscope that observed the structure of the crust.
The main unit of all living things is the cell, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important for the study of life that they are often defined as “the building elements of life. ”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain the flow of blood and its indestructibility.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly to the entire body, which helps to protect him from any potential threats.
Tornados strike a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornados root out trees, extract boards from buildings, and lift cars high in the sky. The most fierce 2 percent of the tornados have lasted more than three hours.
These monster storms come with winds up to 480 km/h (133 km/h; 300 miles/h).
For thousands of years, people have made and used lenses to increase.
The first real telescopes in Europe, however, were made at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us and the nature of cooperation is that when the majority wins, in the short term there will always be more to win if we act selfishly
Our hope is that most people realize that the best long-term solution is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what is out there, others believe that aliens or other lives can live on another planet.
But if that happens at all, it probably won't happen for a very long time, there are trillions of miles between the stars that are "neighbours."
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand at the top of an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
The bodies of the animals consist of many cells, they eat different things and grind them in their stomachs, most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not all; jellyfish, for example, do not).
Animals are all over the earth, digging underground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
One cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, in translation “small room. ”
If you look under a microscope at living things, you will see that they consist of little squares or balls.
Robert Hook, a biologist from England, saw a microscope of small squares in a crust.
They looked like rooms, he was the first person to observe dead cells.
To move from one state to another and not to change the elements and compounds may.
The nitrogen in a gas-like state still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. The composite water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, it has the same molecular structure.
Although his physical condition may undergo a change, the chemical is maintained without change.
Time is all around us and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time is studied by scientists in the field of religion, philosophy, and science for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events from the future to the present and then the past.
Time is also how we compare the length of events.
You can record the past time yourself by watching recurring events. It is a cyclical event that happens again and again at regular intervals.
In our time computers are used to manipulate photos and videos.
Complicated animations can be created on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used in television and movies.
Often music is recorded with complex computers for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first settlers of New Zealand were the Maori who hunted giant birds called moa.
Then the theory lays down the idea that the Maori migrated from Polinesia with a large fleet and took over New Zealand from the moriors, establishing a agricultural society.
But the new evidence suggests that Moriori was a group of land moors that migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own recognizable, peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham, there was another tribe - the Maori, which migrated away from New Zealand.
They were called "morators." There were a few concepts, and eventually the moriors were destroyed.
People who have participated for several decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions while at the same time estimating the difficulties and even failures.
While we listened to people share their personal, family, and organizational stories, we received a valuable understanding of the past and some of the individuals who influenced the culture of the organization.
The understanding of history at least helps people to get an idea of where they fall in the history of the organization, although it does not suggest understanding of culture.
Individuals and all participants discover the deeper values, mission, and driving forces of the organization by assessing successes and realizing failures.
In this case, what helped people to be open to new changes and new guidelines for the local church was the reminder of previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and achievements achieved.
Similar examples of success reduced fears of change, while creating positive tendencies for change in the future.
The convergence patterns of thinking are techniques for solving problems that unite various ideas or areas to reach a solution.
Speed, logic and accuracy are the focus of this thinking, as well as the discovery of facts, the re-application of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important condition for this way of thinking is that only one answer is correct. Only two answers are considered, namely faithful or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain standard procedures or such in science.
People with this kind of thinking have logical thinking, can easily remember models, solve tasks, and work on scientific tests.
In reading other people's thoughts are far the most talented species.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the perceptions of others, their intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires.
Understanding the intentions of others is crucial among these abilities. It allows us to solve possible misunderstandings of physical actions.
If you see someone break a window on a car, for example, you'll probably think he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he'd lost his car keys and tried to break his own car, he'd have had to be tried differently.
The MMR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance, opened in 1930 by Felix Block (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
The magnetic field and the radio waves make the atoms emit miniature radio signals in this resonance.
Raymond Damadian, doctor and researcher, found the basis for using magnetic-resonance images as a means of medical diagnostics in 1970.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the first global one to be awarded in the area of the MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner "for the whole body", which he called "Neblomite".
Asynchronous communication encourages you to take time to think and cause a reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of getting information.
In addition, there are fewer time limits with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
By using the Internet and the world network, students have access to information at all times.
At any time during the day, students can also ask the instructors questions and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting until the next live meeting.
The post-Modern approach to learning offers freedom from absolutes.
In fact, there's not one good thing to learn.
Our current experience with all the training TV shows as “do it yourself” and the presentation of information illustrates this.
Many of us watch a television show informing us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply this knowledge.
We will never repair a car, we will build a fountain in our backyard, we will travel to Peru to see ancient ruins or we will re-model the neighboring home.
Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population, which has access to the Internet thanks to underwater optical cable connections with Europe and a broadband satellite.
Your hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or a private home) will probably have a wifi or PC with an internet connection, and all villages have internet coffee or some place with a public wifi.
As we said above, although the word "eskimos" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered offensive by many northern peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada.
Although you can hear the locals of Greenland use the word, foreigners must avoid doing so.
The local inhabitants of Greenland in Canada are called ‘inuits’, and in Greenland itself ‘kalalek’ (as ‘kallalit’) or ‘grenlander’.
Crime and bad intentions towards foreigners in general are practically unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous places".
Cold weather may be the only real danger the unprepared will face.
If you go to Greenland during the cold seasons (be aware that the colder you are in the north, the colder it is), it is vital that you wear enough warm clothes.

These requirements may often depend on the countries that the traveller has visited or intends to visit.
The abundance of high-quality opportunities for families is one of Charlotte's strengths, North Carolina.
People in other areas often point to a favourable environment for a family as the main reason for moving there, and visitors often discover that the city is pleasant for walking with children.
In the last 20 years, the number of easily understandable for children options in Uptown Charlotte has increased exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by families in Charlotte, although they may benefit under certain circumstances.
There is an extra charge for more than two passengers, so this option may prove more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, which extends around the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Visits with a tourist destination are expensive, require good physical form, can only take place during the summer from November to February and are largely limited to peninsula, islands and sea Ross.
Several thousand employees live here in the summer in about fifty bases, mostly located in these areas; few of them remain in winter.
The inside of Antarctica is a desert plateau covered with ice 2 - 3 km thick.
Incidentally specialized air tours go on land, for alpinism or for going to a pole on which there is a large base.
The route (or the highway) of the South Pole is a road from 1600 km from the McMurdo Station at the Ross Sea to the Pole.
This is compact snow and cracks are filled and marked with flags. The transition is only possible with specialized tractors pulling sleds with fuel and supplies.
They're not very nimble, so the path goes around the Transantartic Mountains for a long time until it reaches the plateau.
The most common cause of winter incidents is slippery roads, sidewalks and most of all steps.
As a minimum you need shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are inappropriate.
The material must be soft enough at low temperatures, and the pattern deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more.
Some boots have spikes and there is an additional gear with slide hooks, which is suitable for most shoes and boots, for currents or the whole walk with a current.
The heels must be low and wide. Sand, chakal or salt (calcium chloride) is often dispersed along roads or paths for better gripping.
Avalanche is not an anomaly; steep slopes can only retain a certain amount of snow, and extra volumes are reduced in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow is sticky and it will take some action to bring it down, and snowing can trigger other events.
Sometimes the original event, which acts as a trigger, is the solar warming of snow, sometimes additional snowfalls, sometimes other natural phenomena often caused by man.
Tornado is a spinning column of air with very low pressure that sucks the surrounding air inside and up.
They cause strong winds (often 100 – 200 miles per hour) that can lift heavy objects in the air and carry them in the direction of the tornado movement.
They are formed at the beginning as funnies descending from storm clouds, and when they touch the earth, they become “thornadas. ”
Virtual Private Network Providers (VPN) Circular in an excellent way both political censorship and trade IP geofiltration.
They surpass web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect not only http, but all internet traffic.
They usually offer a wider frequency band and a better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore it is more difficult to spy.
Media companies regularly lie about its purpose, claiming it is "preventing piracy".
In fact, regional codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; little by little a copy of a disc will be reproduced well to any device where it is original.
The real goal is to give these companies more control over their markets; it is about turning money.
Since calls are rerouted on the Internet, where you live or travel you do not need to use a phone company.
In addition, you do not necessarily get a local number from the community you live in; you can obtain a satellite internet connection in the wild nature of Chicago, Alaska, and choose the number by which you are in sunny Arizona.
Often you need to buy a global number separately that allows PST phones to dial you. For people who call you, it is important where the number comes from.
Applications for a real-time text translator – applications that can automatically translate from one language to another whole segments of text.
Some of the programs in this group may even translate texts into foreign languages into characters or other objects from the real world when the user points the smartphone to them.
Machine translation improved drastically and now often gives more or less faithful translation (and less nonsense), but should be careful since everything is still possible to be wrong.
One of the most famous applications in this category is Google Translator, allowing for offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS apps to navigate your smartphone can be the easiest and convenient way to navigate when you are out of your country.
This can save money instead of buying your own GPS device, or new GPS cards, or rent one from a rental car company.
If you have no connection to your phone data or is out of range, their work may be limited or not available.
Each quarter store is filled with a confusing choice of prepaid phone cards that are suitable for use by both street phones and regular phones.
Although most cards can be collected anywhere, some specifically provide favourable tariffs for calls for specific groups of countries.
These services are often available through a free phone number, with which most phones can be contacted for free.
The rules on standard photography apply also to videos, perhaps even more strictly.
If even taking a picture of something isn't allowed, you shouldn't even be thinking about recording a video.
Check in advance what you are allowed to shoot and what permissions or additional licensing are required if you use a drone.
Getting a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Today, airline tickets are rarely booked directly through the airline without first seeking and comparing prices.
Sometimes a flight may have significantly different prices for different intermediaries and it is worth comparing the search results as well as looking at the website of the airline itself before booking.
Although you may not need a visa for short visits in some countries as a tourist or at work, going there as an international student usually requires longer stay than going as an ordinary tourist.
Living in any foreign country for a long period of time, in general, will require that you receive a preliminary visa.
Compared to the usual tourist or business visas, student visas are usually with different requirements and procedures for application.
For most countries you will need a letter with a proposal from the institution where you want to study, as well as proof of the availability of funds you will need at least during the first year of your training.
Check the institution, as well as the immigration department for the country where you want to study, for detailed requirements.
With the exception of diplomats, working abroad usually means that you will have to make a tax declaration in the country where you are.
Income tax is structured in a different way in different countries, and tax rates and categories vary significantly in individual countries.
In some federal countries, such as the US and Canada, the DOD is collected at federal and local level, so in different regions rates and brackets may vary.
While immigration checks on arrival in the country are usually missing or formality, customs controls may be a problem.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot enter and declare everything outside the law.
The easiest way to start a business with travellers is to lose your skills on a established website for tourist blogs.
Once you are used to formatting and editing the network, you can later create your own website.
Voluntary activities during travel are a great way to make things different, but it is not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know other cultures, get to know new people, get to know yourself, get a sense of perspective and even get new skills.
This may be a good way to stretch the budget, which would allow for longer stay somewhere, because for many jobs such as volunteers are provided place and food, and some pay a small salary.
Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes are still useful. Check that special permits are needed, which may be difficult to get.
The White Sea Canal - the Baltic Sea connects the North Ice Ocean to the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mainly through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is connected to Volga, so the passage from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Be assured that once you reach the port, everything will be clear. You will also meet other hitchhikers who will share their information with you.
In practice, you will put out announcements offering your help, going around the docks, talking to people who clean their yachts, trying to contact sailors at the bar, etc.
If you try to talk to as many people as you can, soon everyone will know you and tell you what boat a person is looking for.
You must carefully choose your airline with a regular passenger program.
Although it is logical for you to choose the airline with which you fly the most, you should know that the privileges offered are often different and other airlines in the same union can be much more generous with respect to regular customer points.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their flight services to Africa. Compared to other European airlines, they offer competitive prices of connections with very large African cities.
From 2014 on, Turkish Airlines is flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check to see how the total price of your ticket to Africa is comparable to the price of a world tour ticket.
For all these places outside Africa, do not forget to provide for additional costs for visas, departure fees, land transport, etc.
If you want to fly around the world entirely in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited because there are no ocean routes.
None of the Union’s alliances cover the crossing points of the three oceans in the South Pole (SkyTheam does not cover any of the intersection points).
The Star Alliance, however, covers the entire area except for the eastern Pacific Ocean - from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, where the LATAM Oneworld airline flies.
If you want to miss the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, this flight is not the only option. (see below)
In 1994, the Armenian ethnic region of Nagorni Karabah in Azerbaijan began a war against the azares.
A new republic was created with the support of Armenians, but no established nation - even Armenia - has officially recognised it.
Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to be eclipsed by diplomatic disputes over the region.
Channel County (Netherland: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th - century area surrounding the inner city of Amsterdam.
As an object of UNESCO’s worldwide heritage, the entire area is marked because of its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, meaning The Five Lands, includes five small coastal villages of Riomajore, Manarola, Cornelia, Vernaca and Monteroso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are listed in UNESCO's World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the uneven, steep landscapes all the way to the cliffs that rise above the sea.
The lack of visible corporate development is part of its charm. Villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and cars cannot reach them outside.
The diversity of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is slightly different from French, which is spoken in France, although they are similar enough to be mutually understandable.
In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has certain small features other than French in France, and the expression of certain words is a little bit more specific.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have studied standard French at school, so they could understand you, even if you were using the standard French numbering system.
In many places around the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means “hello. ”
In Malaysia, however, at least among the Malays of rural areas, this means ‘come here’, similar to a fold to a body indicator, a gesture used in some Western countries, and which should be used only for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may misjudge the hand of good-bye, including a palm facing the waver (not the person to whom he leaves) as a gesture to return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages designed to facilitate communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are separate from the Lingua francs - natural or organic languages that have become one or another dominant means of communication between the speaking other languages.
In the heat of the day travellers can get mirages with the illusion of water (or other things).
They can be dangerous if, by squandering valuable energy and remaining water, the traveler pursues the mirage.
Even in the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real danger if hot clothes are missing.
In the summer, you'll have to guard against mosquitoes, if you decide to walk through tropical forests.
A few seconds with the doors open until you enter the vehicle are enough for mosquitoes to board the vehicle with you, even if you are driving through the subtropical rain forest.
Avian influenza can infect both birds and mammals.
In humans, less than a thousand cases are known, but some have been fatal.
Most have included people who work with poultry, but there is also little risk for birdwatchers.
The steep phyrds and valleys which unexpectedly give way to a high, more or less equal plateau are typical of Norway.
They often call these fabric “vidde, ” meaning wide open space without trees, endless width.
Usually they're called "hey" in Rogaland and Agder, which means a treeless wasteland, often covered with rice.
The glaciers are not stable, but they descend down the mountain, and there are cracks, cracks that can be covered by snow bridges.
The roofs and walls of the ice caves can collapse and cracks close.
Huge blocks relax on the edge of the glaciers, fall and maybe jump or roll further off the edge.
The tourist season for mountain stations is usually the most busy during the Indian summer.
They, however, possess a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, when many mountain stations accumulate with a stable amount of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer prices for bereaved, which are slightly reduced compared to the last-minute travel price for funerals.
Among the airlines that offer them are Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, as well as WestJet.
In all cases, you need to make a direct reservation with the airline on the phone.
