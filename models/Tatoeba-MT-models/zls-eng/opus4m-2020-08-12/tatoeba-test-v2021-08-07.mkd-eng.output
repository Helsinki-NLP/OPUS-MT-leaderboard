I've drawn the word "Alice" to point it out.
I suggested it.
I put three brown spoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I gave up.
I'm growing cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like this.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd like to learn French a lot.
It'd be really nice if you didn't say anything.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I've flushed one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd get it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something wrong?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister tear the letter away.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is it far from Boston?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
I've gone with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I need to get her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should've been more cultured.
I should've checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should've said no.
I showed her my room.
Did you get cold out there?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Dadeba really very slow today, or is it me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on his face.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the chun.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this just forewarned?
I kind of like it.
It's been snowing all day.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this all right?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this place open?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how it's done.
I still don’t understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving to get down.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I suspected.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swam in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still running?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
I spoke to my advisors about which items to collect.
It all makes sense.
It all looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
It can't be!
It's up to you.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never really, could happen here.
There's no way it could have been Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
Doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I'm just about there.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to deal with.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a pretty good statement.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible I'm sneezing.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak pretty good French.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we had to leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel might be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a stickler.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a mess.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
We'd better not go out in this storm.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
I think you should deal with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I've been thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd get him some help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had done well.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you'll have a job to do.
Well, didn't you want the reward?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Well, don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet cap up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do this in one day.
Today is less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It's worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
She looked terrible.
It looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
Seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday.
Looks like these two are dating again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You've got me all worked up.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It might seem strange.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you so.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to pull it off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm in my room.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
It rained two days ago.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's getting ready to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended that you check for negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the prescription medicine.
It's a children's game.
That's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything's in the room.
We're done here.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to leave soon enough.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock already.
It's eleven o'clock already.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete's not on fire.
It's fast enough to walk.
It's a simple matter.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He's been disassembled.
Just make me sick.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
You'd better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's closing time.
He's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily tell them apart.
I guess I misjudged him.
Looks like her style.
It seems to me it's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's how you need it.
It's evil to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching television is fun.
She's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon enough.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's good.
It's getting better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take us long.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little forward.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's no big miracle.
It's no big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
Doing so will not be easy without great help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not just a pen.
There's not enough light here to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a mistake.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds pretty strong.
Sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's fucked up.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom can't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's too bad.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
Still no good.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's funny how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like cauliflowers.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
It's really strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
This heat doesn't hold up.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm guessing nothing.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned the fan on and pointed it towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
It's been a big day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure spending the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
You were getting some sleep.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that fleas living on dogs jump higher than cats.
It was magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was so cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Peter.
It was worth a shot.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
That won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
It's working fine.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you right now.
I used to watch over you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I had to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always been helped by someone.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little busy with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I felt much worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been informed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was careless.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I was helping them.
They hired me to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I've lived here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been busy a lot.

You better ask them first.
Yeah, you found them.

You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would've done the same in my place.
You did a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You've already done it.
He did his best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
They got you, didn't they?
Do you have a key?
You don't have much time left.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
Oh, my God, you know.

You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You've never seen one like it, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.

You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.

That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
You'll have to learn more next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.

You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
