You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You let me down.
What is this?
Me too.
That was very good.
She takes care of her old mother.
That can't be true.

You can't blame everything on Tom.
Give me an example.
What day is it tomorrow?
Can you give an example?

He's not missing anything.
We live in an atomic age.
Mary makes a living sewing.

Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste your words in vain.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm a rookie.

Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or yawn.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
Everything happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see it.
I tried to be nice.
I'm naked.
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's on fire.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't say a word!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You're under oath.
I wish I'd known.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He's known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?

This is a book.
The bedroom's upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you gonna do today?
Taxi's expensive.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
I'd love to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.

How do I call a cab?
You didn't answer the question.
He was naked in the chest and barefoot.
I can ski.
What makes you say that?
It's snowing today.
My head hurts today.
I think Tom got a fatter end.
I'll fix my homework tomorrow.

I have received a regular salary to keep my honest opinion outside the newspapers I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy as to write what he honestly thinks, would be out on the street, looking for some other job. (...)
