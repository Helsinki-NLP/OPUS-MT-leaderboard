What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little down.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps whining about how there's no time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they say it fast.
She didn't even blink.
What did that all mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean something to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the job done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappoint me.
That's not a big deal.
How much will I receive?
I'm teasing you.
If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it goes into his head.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put the ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left my keys.
Where did you get that scar?

I can't live that life.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a difficult decision.
Everyone's crying.
The octopus Paul was right.
He loves football a lot.

I'm not ready yet.

Do you think games and learning are compatible?
I think that's totally ridiculous.
Layla has a wide range of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What year is your car?
The bill, please.
Make sure the cat's outside and the door's locked when you leave.
It remains to be seen if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom was nervous about getting his fingers on the table.
Did you go out last night?
I've got a game to play.
That needs a doctor.
I like the instrument music.
You should thank Tom with a letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.

Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna let this happen.
Let me help you avoid any problems.
I've never tried this before.
Did I drop it?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because he's a man's chauvinist pig.
I've been all over Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for the corrections.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need any help, let me know.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have a high opinion of him as a musician.

Is this what you told Tom?
Everyone's talking.
They're all sick.

I think you can do it.
And who are you?
Keep working.

Music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I didn't think you could do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I passed every test.
I'm sick of you whining.
There's only one way out.
Which brother did you see?
I'll take a look.
Now he's very busy.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kylie Minogue since 12 June 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
Danger lurks on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're becoming reckless.
Is it necessary to make so much noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're very helpful, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't get away from the past.

What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be fine.

She decided to go and study in the United States.

I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joe brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Central Reef - a mountain range located at the bottom of the ocean, at depths up to 4500 metres [4,500 m].
Yeah, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came through the window.
It was something that led to a flood of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's heavy.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was intrusive.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes.

Did you tell Tom this?
You'll ruin your eyesight if you play games all the time.
I'm a Grounder.
I can read different foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are gonna happen.
Say hello to your friends.
What, you still can't drive?
I forgot.
It'll take me a while to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We don't want to get wet.
You're kind of right.
Even though I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
It's just like beans.
I'm good at a lot of things.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
You're wasting your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There are no consequences.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better if you don't eat after seven o'clock.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.
You were right to shave.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom many times.

Don't be bold.
Now things are very different.

We need your help.
Has Tom been notified?
Tofu's doing well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I don't feel like swimming.
She's as beautiful as her mother.
You have a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It's not standing.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come inside.
You won!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so hard to imagine that the movements of panels were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them just as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I acted instinctively.
You have to do that somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload videos to YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.

I'm not upset anymore.
Have you fully recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining hard.
Tom's sick today.
That's what they both like.

What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come inside.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful.
You've got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Start counting.
You must never come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his faults.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He ended up in prison.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom saves money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't walk.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man gets promoted in front of a woman, it's called favoritism, if she gets promoted, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would prefer to stay.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I came.
We are who we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut your dirty mouth.
Show me the documents.
I still mourn the death of my eldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you going back now?
He must be over sixty years old.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I never learned how to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this alone.
I'm on Tom's side.
Almost caught ans a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's wedding godfather.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a bigger friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a moller.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're absolutely right.
They can never do it differently than force.
I thought I'd have another chance at that.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom's laughing, Mary.
It's almost 3:30.
I don't know if that'll be enough money for me.
Can you pull up the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied his belt.
It looked yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I'm adamant against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you couldn't do it.

How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't argue.
Just watch out for Tom.
I'll figure it out.
I'm in better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the pond.
I wish I'd known.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Leave it alone, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom's never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Let's get started.
It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore the country's old empire.
Would you like some more tea?
The nail pierced the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
Little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "The experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets angry if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need for you to do that.
I hope it's dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from his duties in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't stare.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom cooks potatoes to make a potato salad.
Everyone else is.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love from once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with major investments in oil and gas.
I've got a white horse.
Let's talk about this over lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We must respect personal rights.
What is that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland want to come with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
It was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but he failed.
Yumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That wasn't important to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
The limbs of a thorn of cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
Did you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary's Catholic, but her boyfriend's an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy right now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't hang around.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough for now.
Turn around!
It took four kilos of gold to gold out the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers to his head.
Look after me, and I'll look after you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak plainly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income's down by ten percent.
It can be hard to go around an unknown terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long discussion, I ended up making things at random.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're cutting down.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the TV.
I wear short-sleeved shirts in summer.
Old people talk to themselves a lot.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis counter?
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just on my way.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about it.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porno with it, the porno will be made with it.
Canada is the mother country of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is without any doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jogging every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
Stop watching TV and start studying.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad!
I'm sick of fighting.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on her math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
Better nice than force.
You're in trouble.
There is no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
Could that be true?
Keep it down, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
The ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I haven't been told anything.
Tom didn't make friendships as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought a newspaper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I've been open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What is this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You're getting fat real fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a second.
I knew I should never have interfered with your stupid business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch towards Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
I just don't want to do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid addicts on the color diluent.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy hanging out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was spinning around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you stop by sometime?
She wonders how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty when I talk about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic fingertips, creating music that's very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches off the tree last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The path to a man's heart leads across his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house was built of bricks.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partially responsible.
People have been good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning on doing.
To join the choir, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom's taking a nap.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you back.
Why me?
Tom cooks for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human being to always give priority over the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was in school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stupid, insensitive children can sometimes grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like to have him at your place.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very fast.
You're different.
She's a stranger to the hatred of others.
This is gonna make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
The monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Who's Tom?
I was wondering if maybe I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
It's an hour-and-a-half drive to work.
It's right.
Your time will soon come.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us feel that such views are pure madness.
Someone might get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he was gone.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom's guilty.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom got a fatter end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm mad at no one.
I think that's really important.
It's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass or your sisters?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He wrote himself that he had to work in the garden two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
Time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The execution of the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
It was a funny movie.
Bitcoin's a crypt.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Apple's brother?" "Yes." "And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review to Mecca." "Yes." "What did you tell her you learned from it?" "I realized that Phillips's screwdriver was convincing, but not seductive; and that Retti was hard-charging things I think she should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People have been nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I'm just going to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live a day like a lion than a hundred years like a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't need to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm the one who needs to do it.
Tom will call.
He lit the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth to what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of you moaning.
Get out!
We've got two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
The two sides will give speeches this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in a cast.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous on passport control.
Tom needs help.
Defend yourself.
He took a cab to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's asleep.
Tom's an incompetence.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
It's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw a dog.
Maybe she has other plans?
Patient's out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad I'm leaving.
The eagle is the emperor of the birds.
The fire hit the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've got this all wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm grounded.
The cat lay out all the way up in the sunlight that penetrated the window.
Are you going to school on foot or bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, her beautiful face and her young body, is transient.
I saw a mouse.
Try harder.
Two states have negotiated a peace treaty.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
Tom needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I've got a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very kind of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked and barefoot.
She's just out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at it again.
Sounds like treason to me.
That's what you need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Snap the hot dogs!"
Drive slow.
What a man you are!
Double-measure, once cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save a little time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to teach Esperanto why this language is beautiful at the same time and it stimulates our learning, and the international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel many countries.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get any sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I wasn't interested.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything strange.
You never get there in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to bother you when you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom will make progress.
Toma was completely scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt a bit.
We've got to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was moaning with pain.
All or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame on him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom is rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
Honestly, I don't know.
I hope she's okay.
The wind's calmed down.
I have a mirror in my bedroom from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I could have thought of that.
Don't say a word.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-check festival took place in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Where did you get this idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I have no desire to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security's up in town.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy talks like he's an adult.
The carrots cost three dollars.
My bike's new.
Tom told me today he loves me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?

Go upstairs.
No parking allowed there.
I'm getting hurt.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how you play it important.
How long did you stay?
Tom's a passionate cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family moved around a lot.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't stare.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally built.
Is he a handsome man Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's getting wet again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't?
Tom does that sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.

All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or yawn.

Forget him.

She ran her fingers through her hair.
Tom works hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom says.
I'm starving.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Who's Tom?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you dance.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?
Ole, the oldest eel in the world, just died.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a collage on the top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father's so old, he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I've been having trouble solving this problem.
I don't know what it is, still or just before, whether it's good, but more times when I tried to be on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually look happy?
I went there by my own free will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.

They also found that the same wrong assessment had been made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was only a matter of time.
Don't stare.
He should be able to change.

We are who we are.
He's not honest at all.
Wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me so much.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.

Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started to rain.
Tom likes to be busy.
First, first.

I'm a little down.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on the blinker.

Was I really that happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Has Tom changed his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous football player.
I was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Are we gonna see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
It's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's making him meals.
Where'd you learn English?

Do I see it?
Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.

What was the plan anyway?
You should be here at half past half past.

Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a hippo in the zoo.

I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two pieces.

That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a glass window.
Are you done already?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom's a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thinking creatures, only if they get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.

Don't talk.
Come have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.

Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly injured.
If you need help, let me know.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
First one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was a little weird.
Does he read and write Japanese to that?
Tom put a ticket on the table.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
Now a word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't control himself.
It's bedtime.
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the hairdryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.

I'm deaf and mute when I eat.
You look fat.
You have to learn English one step at a time.
Tom is better off now than he was before.
Tom and Mary differ like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he doesn't really want to fulfill and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment to him. One such wish is the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would yearn for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She takes care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.

Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes daily.
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a simple man.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphony.
I'll be quick.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.

Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
Nope.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
Are you texting Mary?
I'll save you a spot in the front row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals unequivocally tortured animals.
How long are you gonna be mad and yelling at us?
How important is that?
Shall we have an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard working with you.
Tom's getting fat.
It's my fault.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
You need to tear down a few old houses.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very thoughtful.
When will you leave?
This report wasn't written very well.
She points out that this last move of government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.

I wish I could have thought of that.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really nice to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just an essay problem, it's all these horrible questions and explanations of words driving me crazy!
It's the weekend.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
I wish you were there for me.
Try this.
Clean up a little bit.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do it either.
Let's take another look.
Last time I went to the beach, I burned badly.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by spraying stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't support it.
Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid to die.
I can't fix the car alone.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into it.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely got a fatter end.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent, and now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
Tom's not getting away.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you can think of can help.
That's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm sorry.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He's learning by doing what he does.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I failed.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Have some.
He's talking about others how he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
Seems okay to me.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
Reaction isn't always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with the proportional part of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
But it was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the filenames before trying to restore deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.

A lot of things work out for me.

Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much will I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been getting ready for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You shouldn't throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
Don't cry.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do it.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull the thick end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've had a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There's no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something now.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.

I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song just for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as mail?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved slowly forward.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't look.
It looks blue on you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not taking part.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass your exams?
I'm all for your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
The knife is very sharp.
It's clean.
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing mistake.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom's got a nice garden.
A cup of coffee clears my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got bad hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that guy.
We'll miss you a lot if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?

Don't rush.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He devoted his life to achieving a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.

What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Nationality is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He repairs electronic devices.
You're losing.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to stand up to this.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Hand me the sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where'd you get the keys?
Did you ever hang a video on YouTube?

I could kill you now.

I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep your mouth shut all the time?
He took off his clothes.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
He's driving a pole.
My right hand is numb.
I don't know anything about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Have a seat, please.
Does that happen often?
A bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I resigned it.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between persons of the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.

We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve me to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you hand me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll study harder.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do it.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Shame on her.
I got two cats.
I already said I don't know how it's done.
His girlfriend wasn't supportive.
I didn't care about that.
Some of them have been and are still in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for kids.
That was a pain in the ass.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipefeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a pettyr.
Control yourselves.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my lucky one.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Several trees fell during a storm in our environment.
I'm sure I've seen her before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were that rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm out.
Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have work to do tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
It helps us a lot.
I filled a glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the entire village.
The rumor spread fast.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Smoke slept with 25 men during one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Is that what you're mad about?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Costs are about to rise.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.

I hope Tom remembers this.

We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for the day.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precaution to avoid infections in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like people who are in trouble.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
It could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car by myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
One second later, his lips were twisting into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for the course dropped when her favorite lecturer moved out.

I barely closed my eyes.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom's named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide to that guy?
I'm going to take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
What makes you say that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She wraps her hair with a pipecap.
He's been released from military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play many times.
You tried.
I'm taking you dancing.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She's making it out of a mosquito elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to what's best, because it's always individual and it depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year's training.
The house burned to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The most rainy months are May, June, July and August.

I've already written a piece of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the papers.
It has something to do with what...
It can't be about passion. Maybe it's just about sex.
Are you done washing dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do it.
Tom will pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their natural talents.
I'd leave.
You're very rude.
You let me down.
There's snow on this mountain all year.
I don't think you should rush into anything these days.
What's in nature forever, when everything is so fleeting?
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
You got that right.
Everything you have will one day have you.
As busy as Tom is, he never forgets that our e-mail to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Look them up.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to take a nap in about an hour.
Now I'm pretty happy.
He first performed a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before being sent for laboratory testing.
We were walking in the parks.

I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It's been a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was watching closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
This was sophisticated and embellished in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that a little someone dared to work closely with him.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
Merauke is the easternmost city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here a lot as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us the ghost story.
Check everyone.
Session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut cheese into thin pieces or small cubes.
Have you ever had a car accident?
I'd like to get started.
I didn't wear intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused real confusion.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He got out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're being honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Even though I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I'm supposed to write ten pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where do I sit?" "Anywhere."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for deaf audiences.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I called him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the moles in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that the FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer one last question first.
Is this what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only 5:00 in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with it will eventually happen.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
I know this is weird.
He never got over his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
They all sat down.
If you have nothing else to do, the number of the Greek island.
She always wears snotty clothes.
Is that gonna work it out soon?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Who's Tom?
Tom seemed older and older than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of this mountain is flat.
She smiled.
Those who worship Vishnu are called Vishnuan, and those who worship Sheba are Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown up.
I've completely lost track of my thoughts.
I've never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned down Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This exceeds all limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy on Mondays.
Both my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I didn't think you could do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move over.
We should study.
We have no other choice.
When it's like this, it's best to sit at home and not go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During the experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe any images from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
They've all held their breath.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you work.
I hope we visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half past.
I'm still a little tired.
To seek to maximise his own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to a human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I don't sing.
It's weird that nobody knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is nowhere near as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we knocked down and discovered it was 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like a fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're scared of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
Nobody was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still doesn't have the experience for this job.
Can you help us?
Will you chill?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could've left, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud that he's a Serb, with their historic highest achievements -- the slaughter of chiefs and genocides?
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom's lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna take a look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
Everyone's smiling.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak fluently to Hindi.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written a piece of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one's died... yet.
Can we people weld grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We got three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to make you nervous.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They're selling sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and calmness, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'm never gonna mention this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will be in Tokyo at 5:30.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Look out!
Tom failed to give any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I was just on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelette.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to get through the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I've been having trouble solving this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm texting Tom right now.
It's an exception.
Tom came in a little early today than usual.
A horse could have been eaten.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which one's easier?
Tom asked for a raise.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have home spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do it either.
The stories of Snori Sturluson tell the rest that Christianity in Norway has spread through violence.
Answer me now.
Make yourselves at home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gold-plated necklace is a necklace that will "shake your world".
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining hard.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
The solemn dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Marie jumped out of the window into the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk around holding hands.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
The baseball's boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I'm just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look at the size of it!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in pipes, twice in a well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to draw attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into big nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a very long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not coming with you.
Be careful.
Could I just interrupt for a second?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intention.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were in a meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe that Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in these elections.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
I probably don't want to read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that point, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said was gonna happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's perfectly normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
I never thought about it.
Keep your voice down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
He wouldn't like that.
I'm really curious.
Tom's double-parked.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
They're at sea on the islands.
I've never had a problem sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Any other options?
The amount for the job and interest on the capital invested was several million.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea rises, the sea rises, the sea rises.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated about us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom's been working for about nine hours.
I hope I can do it.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do it.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give himself up?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
It makes me very angry.
Is it still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very kind of you.
I wish I could have thought of that.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom's strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lezilebic.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, as he became a victim of a conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Can you let Tom know I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French on my own.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his bad spot.
You're one of us.
There's one foot in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare the shit out of me.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Why are rabbit ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in walking.
This one's pretty cool.
I was just enjoying myself.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this paper.
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of fighting.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you dance.
I was definitely lucky.
What's the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get drunk.
I just want to get out of the way.
Don't let him get away with this.
Be careful.
He's at first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for showing my, often contradictory, emotions to each other.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't arrived yet.
How do we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
What kind of insurance do I have to choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music pieces for a fan.
Secretary of the United States John Kerry broke his right femur in a cycling accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of midwives, they're sneezy kids.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes went off.
Have you fully recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
An accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's for nothing.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the side side is in New York.
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be something more modest this year.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often child molesters.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom came out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I was exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You shouldn't judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are asleep.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and broke up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Phase one is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Toma feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn at your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives next door?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It is important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to nobody liking me.
The brakes went off.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was 13.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
It was a difficult decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow's a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come take a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Go take a swim with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A female chiffonist isn't complete without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing else to be done but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it all wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure that the pilot is Evangeline.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
The deer is faster than the strong one.
People used to write books on typewriters.
I reacted instinctively.
It's the bathroom.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Maria learn how to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I hope not.
How could I hate Tom?
Take this.
How barbaric!
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.
When the cat is gone, the mouse wheel leads.

Tom's alone.
No matter what you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.

Tom was celebrating his reunion last week.
I'll sit at the table there.

Who's first?

Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.

I was at the front desk.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.

Nobody knows what's gonna happen next.
I've made up my mind.
Do you have a copy?
Let's go to the movies.
I wouldn't hurt her.
In this phase of world history, in America there is not one such thing as independent printing. You know it and I know it. There is not one among you who dares write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, but in advance he would know that it will never appear in the press. I get my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the papers I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks, would find yourself out outside, on the street, looking for another job. If I had allowed my true opinion to appear only in one newspaper issue that I work for, I would get fired from work in less than 24 hours. The job of journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie, to pervert, that slander, that my true opinion lies at the front of whose feet lies, that this state and its people to their daily portion of bread and to the other.

I'd rather not be involved at this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
I'm the only one who can do it here.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom will recover.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
I could talk to Tom.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing okay.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.

It would be different.
They're all there.

Did you talk about me?

Does your head hurt?

It doesn't play any part anymore.
Get help.
Tom suffers from chronic pain.
Tom installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
I want you to find out if Tom and Mary are planning on being alone here.

He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You've been spying on me.
It's nighttime, family dinner.
We'll never go back there.
Are we going home?

I made a mistake this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is everything settled now?
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a few friends.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.

That's a very unkind question.
Find out what happened.
I'll study German.
Thank you so much for this information!
If I didn't know you well, I'd think you were hiding something.
Tom thought he had time.
He apologized, so I didn't want to give it any special significance.
Here, ask Tom.
You need to focus on your virtues.

Are you involved in this?
For example, parents should teach their children how to be gentle.
Tom was sitting behind me.
It's dark.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Thank you for your warm words.
What am I doing here?
I can't believe you lied to me.
We've already decided that.
How exciting!
I've been looking for you.
The frost has done great damage to crops.
Maria's a waste of money.
Just tell me you're okay.
I didn't know you were worried.
Where are we meeting?
Tom's recovered.
Tom will be here for a few days.
Come out with us.
Tom writes better than I do.
He likes to make a mosquito out of a mosquito.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
I'm only the first year.
I've had a really bad day.
I saw a mouse.
Let me sit down.
What do you got there?
It's great.
Who are you trying to trick?
Bears are pretty dangerous.

Tom knows what's coming next.
The doctor did what he had to do without the little princess ever hearing it.

They tortured Tom.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Actually, I'm a nice guy.

To upgrade the firmware, go to the download page and fetch the latest version.
Come in, Tom.
We're both rich.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Tom's gonna wait.
Does that happen often?
He's mostly dissatisfied.
It's real.
Did you see me play?
I hate the smell of onions.
Don't call me when I'm in the office.
Tom hasn't taken anything but water since last night.
Please tell me I'm right.
My wife, who grew up in Norway, made it clear to me from the very first moment that it was no longer current that a woman was running around her husband all day.
I bought a book.
There's no need to worry about that.
I want to see you.
I can't do anything today.
Something wonderful happened today.
You're not rational.
Let it go, Tom.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
How long is the Nile River?
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Let's stretch our legs.
Are you done?
You should be able to do it.
Tom hesitated for a moment.
I'm relaxed.
The sun is a star.
Where's your school?
You'll probably never see me again.
We haven't had enough yet.
You underestimated me.
Tom's already here, but Mary hasn't arrived yet.
He's a criminal, you know that?
Tom's getting married next month.
For what?
Are we safe now?
I remember something about that.
I won't try to predict the future.
Sometimes it's too late to apologize.
Am I welcome here?
You can sit next to me.
Are you ready?
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
My husband lost his job.
Don't lie.
I've always wondered this.
There goes our bus.
You're contradictory with yourself.
Do you think it's worth saving these letters?
It's a small but beautiful house.
I'll pass.
Haven't you finished yet?
I really like your music.
How insightful!
How did I miss this?
I'm leaving work early today.
Are you ready?
Tom and his family moved to Australia.
Tom's the only one who can do this.
I must say I envy you.
We need to be quiet.
Maria turned down the offer because she thought she'd be better off at the bank.
Tom couldn't say anything else.
I baked bread.
I hope you like it.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't commit suicide.
You're made for me.
Are you busy here?
We're out of food.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
How's married life?
It's working.
I wasn't interested.
We're surviving.
This building will be built in the city.
Don't fight.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom signed off on the cover of his new diary.
I can't imagine that.
I have no intention of changing.
I'm getting good at it.
They voted.
Who are you coming with?
I trust you.
It's fascinating how many sentences you can make with five words.
I exaggerated.
Everyone has a price.
We're gonna have a great time.

Enjoy it while you still can!
Why is Tom wearing a coat?
Start counting.
I sing well.
That says a lot about you.
Tell Tom to try harder.
Tom won't let us do it.
Life has become very difficult.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to.
Maybe Tom's not hungry.
I always think about it.
I should never have listened to you.
Tom wanted to be okay.
I have to get used to it first.
Please repeat?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?
Tom eats chocolate almost every day.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Don't talk.
I could go with you.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

I'm really looking forward to being here.
What's up, Tom?
Tom's going through a midlife crisis.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
You bastard!
Stop talking.
I can't forget that.
Who's knocking on the door?
I've been waiting.
This money will really help.
It's all the same under the law.
From the moment he saw him, his heart stopped.
I don't understand the problem.
You must be new here.
Please come.
Is breakfast included in the price?
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Just give Tom a second.
Tell Tom to try harder.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
I already ordered it.
Check it out.
Are you done washing dishes?
I always thought it was weird.
The ring is tight.
All we know is that Tom is guilty.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom's got his head down.
We have therefore set up a small portable hut that can be divided into two parts and can be driven anywhere.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to sleep over.
Let's get to know each other!
The shortcoming is being ugly.
That can't be true.
Please don't say that.
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about that.
I wish I knew what's going on here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad weather wouldn't let me leave.
Tom hired a private detective to follow Mary.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
My French isn't that good yet.
Can't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think we might have been too aggressive.
We'll never go back there.
No one knows what she's turned into.
Fish is good for you.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I'm a rookie.
I'm used to it.
Listening to music is my single way of relaxing.
Tom got on the bus.
You've been very quiet.
Get him.
Come see me after work.
How did I miss this?
That boy talks like an adult.
You're staring at TV again instead of doing your homework!
I need a haircut.
I think I'll be back in about 30 minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on an island?
Nobody cares why Tom's a vegetarian.
Tom's pretty mysterious.
Did you eat anything?
It's easy to scare Tom.
I'll try everything someday.
Tom taught me how to read.
Tomorrow's math test.
Laughing is contagious.
They sell fish and meat.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
We'd better get ready.
I'm into it.
Tom just told me the opposite.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out for dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said cannot be applied to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
It wasn't important to me.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of it.
They'll know what to do.
We failed.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't buy that.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
He looks young for his age.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to trick?
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can do it.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
A new snowy avalanche took place on its way to Eceskaret, Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night and it is not known if anyone is trapped in an avalanche.
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car by myself.
Zini!
Please hurry.
Tom nodded.
Should we tell anyone?
He's flooded with cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more psychological than physical.
He's out.
He started yelling.
Tom could have been better.
Tom's getting fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't get carried away.
That meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Aren't you done yet?
I'm gonna have to think about that question,
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary get along just fine.
When can Tom come home?
I see a reflection of my face in the window glass.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could've spared me coming if you'd told me I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
This is going to make our swearing a lot easier.
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the board up in the toilet.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours uninterrupted.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Tom's probably still gonna be pissed off.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
That's not what I'm falling for.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted that he was a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Are we starting soon?
You can't go into that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the entire manual for work from 321 pages in her breath.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.
Which eye hurts?
How old are you?
Did I drop that?
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked in many years.
What a nice house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It's dark.
Don't get in Tom's way.
I really like to practice.
You have to go to school.
That book costs 3,000 yen.
I only started working here today.
She doesn't like to be told what to do.
Fashion gets old and dies.
Many words are borrowed from foreign languages.
Tom never forgave me for doing it.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Basically, my dear Watson.
History is written by the winners.
I'm deeply ashamed.
The writer of the book "Last Mojican", James Fenimore Cooper was the first fighter to protect nature.
We should start over.
He has great experience and his competence has branched out in several areas.
That's enough!
I bought a lot of things.
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What's all the fuss about?
Tom's confidence was broken when his boss took him down in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I'm probably not gonna watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most are afraid to set themselves a great goal out of fear of never reaching it.
I'm naughty.
I know.
That's all I care about.
They sat on the grass, played ukulele and sang.
I can't imagine life without books.
This building is blue.
I could eat a horse.
It's a really nice day out there.
This must be important.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
It is the third city, the largest, in Serbia.
What year was your car made?
Sit tight.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What can I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They failed to continue in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's learning hard.
It takes a lot of imagination trying to add a new sentence here.
Things might have worked out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked.
Finish this.
He came to see you yesterday.
Tom's having a bad day.
Don't answer that.
Did the red rose bloom?
I'd like to leave.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Pride tends to become pride, which is a close family of madness.
How long will Tom last?
The rainy season starts in June.
Who knows what's gonna happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I wish I could paint like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I never repented.
We limit our luggage to 10 kilos per piece.
We'll never go back there.
Years have passed.
They set up an Air Force Joint Command where the Director and Chief of Staff were, inspectively, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his ukulele and started singing.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try it.
There's chaos here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's so bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
He got in trouble because of a lie when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his age.
I really like my team members.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I've got a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister, Mary.
I could've used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll do my best to find them.
I could lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what I'm supposed to do.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we know.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really that happy?
The fuse's blown.
I can't fight it anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows how to knock real fast.
She writes to her son sometimes.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried about getting lost.
I think it's best to be nice.
Africa is the cradle of mankind.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite lecturer was Jackson.
I'm not the only one who didn't like that movie.
Don't you remember the question?
I like it when it's cold.
Don't jump!
I didn't know.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm sympathetic.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a pettyr, isn't he?
Better a kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You need to speak up.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Did you have lunch?
How much is this gonna cost me?
I'm a hero.
For every male, there's a female version.
Are you talking about us?
Mary felt hurt when her children couldn't make an effort to contact her for March 8th.
Tom was saving money to buy a car.
I'm not surprised at all.
How much money do we need?

It's June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
I just got here.
All you have to do is practice.
I was so busy with Tatoeb again, I almost dehydrated.
We have to do this.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing ukulele.
Before this decision comes into force, no one will move their fingers to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom will talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I'm used to doing that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom doing at work?
That needs a doctor.
I want to be human again someday.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I doing here?
Tom often wears black.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
Danger lurks around every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom sells cars.
Anyone want a beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I have an idea.
Tom bought the hulahop.
They'll know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
Mom transplanted the flowers in the garden.
Tom's not confused.
I get the impression he's pretty arrogant.

It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
Her dissertation must be written in English.
Now I have to go.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
After winning the lottery, she went shopping.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of monitoring many activities on Earth, listening to communications lines, registering the working frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Maria are playing chess with a set of hand-cut chess figures allegedly made of ivory.
If the account already exists, the system you can receive and send an email will work.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take your coat off?
I'm really proud of it.
I think we should concentrate on other things.
Did your girlfriend like the flowers?
I'm a little new at this.
This should work.
Nancy's from London.
I'll call.
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
FIFA consists of 209 associations.
Everyone's been waiting.

We've got enough here.
We kicked him out of the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
I'm homeless.
I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were taking the Boston bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could've used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs over the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean it's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't stare.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope Tom's predictions come true.
If we got here early, maybe we could save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
The gold is in the green woods.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom was sitting very still.
Norway has a lot of old empty stables.
She worked so hard, she ended up getting sick.
I'm not the fashion guy.
I can't forget her eyes.
Show me your papers!
I've never tried this before.
Sugar dissolves in warm coffee.
I can't believe you lied to me.
Tom writes nice.
She was prescribed medical cannabis to relieve undesirable effects of chemotherapy.
Come see me after work.
Are you involved in this?
So you want to learn another language.
What day is tomorrow?
Tom put his drink down.
Maybe he'll come see us tonight.
The air conditioning's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
Would you like some more mashed potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Of course, such a project required budget rebalancing.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very fast.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I didn't do it either.
There's a guard outside.
I'll be in my neighborhood.
We'll go over it again.
I wasn't nervous about it.
It's fun.
Girls like to play house.
I wish I hadn't done it.
The train arrived on time today, as always.
You want to talk to Tom for me?
Norway is my new homeland.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Has anyone told Tom about this yet?
Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not the right man for the job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this interference?
Tom could convince Mary to do it.
Was I really that happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What were you doing today?
How much will I receive?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I'll give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm leaving early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what that is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get lost!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you being childish?
We could have saved Tom if we had arrived a few minutes early.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I'm supposed to buy a new coat because my old man's hatching.
Trolovski Wall is the highest European vertical mountain wall that has 1700m to the bottom, of which 1000m is a vertical cliff.
I'd like to introduce you to Tom.
There is little doubt that cutting in the already naked system will have dramatic consequences for industry and municipalities in rural areas.
You were offended by it, even though it had no meaning at all, and it was supposed to be something funny on my part, but you didn't see it that way.
Who has time for this?
I'm still sleepy.
Tom's a day-trader.
My stomach hurts.
We calculated that we could get to that place within two weeks.
I passed all the tests.
Mary works as a waitress at a nearby bar.
Let me explain.
I forgot my baby monitor.
She reacted to that.
I'm naked.
What do you have there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher's saying.
Have a good week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views on sports.
I'm coming to save you!

I'm scared to death.
There was only one little problem.
I'm all alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't at all confident.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The planes are landing at the airports.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems dissatisfied.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's over-extreme.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put it.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at 7:00 in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom's gonna be able to help us get through this.
I've already been paid.
They're all concerned.
Did I call you?
Come Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't stare.
They happened to hear some suspicious activity in the bar, indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I've been all over Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't stare.
You asked for it.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame everything on Tom.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm devastated.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department made fun of her for her clothes.
They're either going through it or they're going through it.
I'll get right on it.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy a walk along the pilgrimage path in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Have you been watching?
Are you busy here?
I choose between two options.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at 5:30.
We didn't do it.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, pass me the salt.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas book sale, and it's hardly gonna get thrown out of place by a book.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a fuss?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me one more reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
Get changed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared in advance.
I don't count on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls wore weed skirts and had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?

No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was sophisticated.
This sad story was written at the time of Tom's exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove it?
Dead end.
It's so easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I'd rather not be involved in this right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been terrible.
I'll loan you the workbook if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as me.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.

Are they in love?
Where do you want me to meet you tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.

Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
Stiglic is a very interesting bird.
The relationship between personality and blood type has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.

I don't sing.
I'd love to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The data transfer task force, led by Ben Mani, will hold a meeting on January 14th 1999.
Some say that if you step on a rainworm, it will start to rain.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Tom knows how to knock very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give yourself up like that.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write the letter to?
I might need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That'd be okay.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no policy.
Write down what I'm saying.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
There was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't set foot outside today.
Did they tell you why?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
She was saving her life.
I think we should call a doctor.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom in the act.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big fan of football.
What do you intend to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Can you hand me the water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elemental, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to pick you up.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
The drugs don't usually need to be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people no matter what age they are, don't lose their beauty.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's pretty amazing.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Look into it.
She was dressed in red.
What does a Soviet scientist study?

Solar energy is clean of its energy.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dance?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We have no other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking of going to Australia myself.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really that individual?

That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialty?
I'm twice Tom's age.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never been camping.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
The Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's beautiful.
That's what I think.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with crossed bars for wind stability and snowfall, and this must be a two-layered tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we meeting?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's interviewing the patient.
Tom passed his drink.
It's a matter of justice.
I could lose my pension.

I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in their own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We split up on the corner.
Are you mad about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that fall out to me?
Did you sleep?
They tried hard in court.
Is there a reason you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I have your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric's not from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started studying French last year.

Money's talking.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I double-parked.
I've never seen that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I'm about to come look for you.
He's leading a busy life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got a real attitude.
Anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to breast-shaped deformation if they rotate on the hip.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little dizzy.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports so you could take a closer look at them.
I'm not as rich as we'd like.
Get on board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.

Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.

Let's not be emotional.
Tom's very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind blows from.
Women are the most beautiful thing in a man's life.

Mary took the liberty of traveling.
They live on a high foot.
Tom's out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
You don't support me very much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything, he's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.

Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Tom wore black jeans.
Must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art than science.

It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom counted the change.

Tom was with a girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not gonna ask Tom to do it.

I pretended I didn't understand.
Would you talk to Tom?
Can you hand me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now's the time to enjoy it.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually have for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice Tom's age.

All things must pass.
Get in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't have a wish for that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.

I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.

What's bigger, the sun or the earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you lost ten pounds.
You disappoint me.
We'll get right to it.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The fuse's on fire.
Are we safe now?

By the way, what's your address?
This one's awkward.

I thought you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.

It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He kicked the ball in the goal!
It's a big day, son!
We were filled with joyous expectation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?

Whether or not it's a moral choice of translators, things sometimes sound better if they stay the way they are in the language in which they were created.
Look at what I've grown up to be!

What did you do now?
I'm pathetic.
How long have you lived here?
Do you think the situation will improve?

The keys are in the Chiffonier.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
By what name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been?
She's smiling.

I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.

The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.

Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like that's what Tom thinks.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone changes.

Did you see me play?
Why would Tom want that?

I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any harm.
I was the only man in the tourist group, and the rest of them were Arab women living in Istanbul.

Tom came to help.
Sometimes conflicts between families spread through generations.

We'll try it your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one was watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never regretted it.
Toma was as angry as a lynx.
Tom might have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What have you both done?
Don't yell.
What an experience!
Tom's learning how to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.

She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to use it?
I could go there now.
Everyone cheered.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive safe.
Let's see.
Do you have perfume?
Don't play the monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
He makes such a face that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.

Have you fully recovered?
Tom wore black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky I survived the accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because it's so crowded.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom's gone.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
Drive slow.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came here.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cat, please don't pass.

I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone please tell me what to do?

You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had a problem sleeping.

I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.

I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom muffled the smile.
I'm scared.
What name?

Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It all stopped.
The book was sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I have no doubt he will succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My father-in-law enjoys the tea ceremony.
She was smiling.

Who are you running from?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand the wrong way.
