Veli Parliament MPs worry that "it will look like Muppets"
Some MPs (Assembly Member, AM) were amazed at the proposal that they could be called representatives of the Welsh Parliament in the future.
This came because of plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Assembly representatives from all political spectrum are concerned that they might become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour Party parliamentary representative said his group is concerned that the term "rhyming with Twp and Pwp" is "rhyming with".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp shit.
A parliamentary representative from the Walles Party (Welsh. Plaid Cymru) said the group was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word “w” is pronounced similar to the phrase “u” in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the law for the introduction of the name change, said: "Of course the final decision on how parliamentarians will be appointed on their own."
The Government of Wales' 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that met with broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what will be called representatives in the assembly, the Committee was prone to the term " MEPs" or "MWPs", but the MWP option was given the greatest support during the public consultation.
Assembly lawmakers are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who are expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentarians will have a decisive vote on the issue of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on country name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents its own Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise a referendum decision.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is a simple price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
They silenced St. Martin's bells while the churches in Harlem were fighting for survival.
"The older people I talked to said there could be a bar and a church on every corner in the past," Mr. Adams said.
"There is neither today."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People hang out today in another way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood in which people regularly reside."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think "early or later it will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood will live.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "that is why the day will come faster when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who have moved into those apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held the services nearby has taken possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the head of a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of poor men. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July used a second term: "cultural treasure" and "non-replaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing at a larger carillon in Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought by the lay leaders of the church and other episcopal children.
The sacristy, the parish's managing body made up of laymen, wrote in July because of concerns that the diet would "try to transfer costs" to sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the children.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the side of the diet.
Shark injured 13-year-olds while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then he rowed with the group to the point of attack to help extract him from the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy he noticed that his whole clavicle had been torn apart.
“I’m screaming to get everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but was found not to be a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas at 48 hours to conduct investigations and customer safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entry into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition with chains such as Boots, SuperOthers and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of department stores and hiring specialized sellers.
As part of the major entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow compared to the decline in the clothing market and home equipment, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and extended to additional shops next year if they are shown to be successful.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use space on shelves that was once designed for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Representatives of Sainsbury’s said they would double the size of the offer of cosmetic products on 3000 products, including first-time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of companies L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will receive more space with areas for certain brands similar to shops such as Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger customers are looking for more and more.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second one that opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that outlets will look more and more like department stores while this supermarket chain seeks to resist favourable shops such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlets of Argos into hundreds of shops, as well as a large number of divisions of clusters because two years ago he bought both chains, which he claimed stimulated the sale of live foods and made those acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Booths in early 2000, but it ended in a fight over the division of income from a pharmacy in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for a 125 million GBP sold his pharmaceutical job at 281 Store Celesia, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims Lloyds will play a role in the plan by listing in four stores a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our departments with cosmetic products in order to provide our users with a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in the special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old purchasing habits."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million-pound contract
Dragon’s Den Peter Jones was left to “boil out of anger” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
Their brand was compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of this Morning (37) on Instagram announced she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon’s Den Peter Jones’s star to cook out of anger by pulling out of a joint profitable job at the last minute to focus on her new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "angry" when the Golden Girl of Television admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his Marlow business empire in Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant that there is no time left to devote to their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
This job was compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have secured it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was startled by everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday so close to running the entire line.
At the headquarters of Marlowe's warehouse is full of goods that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the host of this Morning, one of the best investment stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes and possible additional delays in the launch of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were ten years of close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016 Willoughby founded Truly with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined them as president of the administration in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as head of ITV's I’m and Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the paper for comments some might view as "unworthy presidents" and because he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news leader.
"I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denucleisation are stuck.
More than three months after a meeting in Singapore in June, North Korean chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north had not noticed a "response reaction" to US disarming activities in North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States has not yet lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stand in his speech at the convention.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"He threatened us with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would get killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the interruption of test launch of rockets, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of remaining US soldiers to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It is so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people to enter this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly ahead of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for using international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear about not asking for international help, so it is all a bit problematic," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
In view of the ever-shaking earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared for carrying on with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not something common on other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of a warning siren at the tsunami in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at best, the journey between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to take care of the earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesian decomposed structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of funding, and next year new elections are held.
Yoko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs are fighting in the streets of machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge scored for equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday from defeating the game Premier League against Chelsea at 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal score at 1:0 for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before kicking it towards the opposite stage.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball finally escaped Kepaya Arrizabalagaj, who jumped towards her and entered the network.
"It was demanding to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try as hard to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea was in the middle of 1-0 after the hit by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue passed the ball back to Mate Kovacic during that match before turning somewhere in half the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led to Hazard's goal.
Hazzard bypassed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot in the net at the opposite point next to Liverpool's goalie, Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Naples in the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m. Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the state disaster office announced on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency said at a press conference that it was reported that a large number of people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that felt Friday and caused waves of height up to 6m.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body was found at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to speak to us, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived who believe they knew this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and police have said the next of kin's relatives are under way.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He lost his word when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take several hours until they can return to their apartments.
A police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene of a crime in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 2:00 in the fenced area, there were two police vans, and another one was parked right outside.
A large number of policemen stood within the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
All those who have any information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, calling 101 or anonymously addressing the organization Crimestoppers to number 0800 555 111, referring to the report 247 of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument found amid debate over "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for nearly Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupidity" and "trying to end history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate currently under way regarding the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace would become subject to discussion.
The econoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for his ancestors Thomas' actions in the last century.
Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful life proves the way of thinking in the 19th century and is part of the history of a person many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, by the defender of parliament than by external pressure. Of course, in his case, it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historic debate that continues.
What's for sure is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His accomplishments as Lord of Protectors remain worthy of honor and tribute."
A pig killer executed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and executed a farmer in a southwestern market in China.
A man named Yuan was found deadly cut arteries and covered in blood near a market stop in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, published the South China Journal on Sunday.
The pig breeder was ready to vaccinate pigs in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in Xing in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos bit the breeder to death.
Evening news from Guiyang states that a cousin named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and maimed."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje news that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration allegedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her wife on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig nicked a Welsh farmer by a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs were eaten by a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "firer".
"They are only played.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Ross bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weak crossing the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flood rains in the North Mexico and southwest United States during the following days.
At 0500 hours Eastern time, Rosa blew at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and it was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, an area of low pressure is being created and is moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, she will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture heading north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy rainfalls to occur on a large part of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, muddy floods and possible desert slides.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfalls of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
The floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunder showers will bring local storms and dusty wind.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains on the coast of southern California.
There may be rainfalls of more than 12 mm, which can cause less muddy torrents and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and Monday morning before they cover a wider area at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will expand on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the state of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the United States are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, lagging summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in most Central and Eastern United States the start of October will be warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to the parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a great opportunity beyond average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched six television networks Thursday, a tense testimony by candidates for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the '80s.
Meanwhile, a political fight continued, and reporters interrupted a regular programme to notify Friday's turning point: a deal reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an arduous testimony that he was absolutely certain that it had not happened.
Friday's hearing was likely accompanied by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate number of viewers available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch the content in offices.
To give you a better idea, it's about an audience that's like the one who's watching the game of American football or the award of Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen announced that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS's cameras on Friday morning, they recorded protesters yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee's hearing.
For a few minutes, he was standing there with his eyes down while live in front of CNN's cameras, the protesters filled him with misdemeanors.
"I am standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had made a statement before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the board hearing.
A few hours later, all the cable and television networks were watching live when the Justice Committee was to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against candidates next week, which were demanded by minorities.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her EU exit plan to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview with her on the cover, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs fees is "complete nonsense".
Wade Sims' murder: police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspect in LSU's death
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Sims' firearms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of manslaughter, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
A bail of $350,000 has been requested.
The East Baton Rouge municipality's coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police administration thanks the task force for the fugitives of the state's federal police, the federal police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for aid in an investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Allev, thanked the local authorities for law enforcement on "sustainability and search for truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 183 cm-high wing player grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne played LSU basketball.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "snake" and "in shock" over Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Vulcan casts ashes on Mexico City
The ash that casts out the Popocatapetl volcano reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National disaster prevention centre warned the Mexicans Saturday not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple rumblings and tremors.
The pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of volcanoes located 72km southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake in 2017 rocked central Mexico.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police conflict and Catalan separatists face anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocate independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the anti-demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarising secession vote.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began to throw eggs and powdered paint at the police, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights broke out later on during the day the police used the batons to calm down the fight.
During a few hours, independent groups ran "There is no forgetfulness, there is no forgiveness", and the Unionists shouted "Long lived Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that pursues independence have not subdued for a year since the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, and which the Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence even though the turnout was low because those against secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce conflicts last year after police tried to stop holding ballots at polling stations across the region.
The independent groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
"We had one of the best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, although a close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan Independence Party finds it difficult to hold momentum this year because their most famous leaders are either in a self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial because of their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has announced to the investigative prison since the end of last year that he will run for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way we can declare the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after they drove their car into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place Thursday around 7:30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the yard door and the building itself.
It's possible there's an arrow fired from the crossbow on the car at some point.
Menge score brought Livingston a win over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
First goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston won
The new Scottish Premiership League club Livingstone surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to acknowledge his only second defeat of the eighteen games at the club's head from Ibrox Stadium.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive while Gary Holt's team lined up with the Iberian in seconds.
Gerrard's team is still without winning the guests' premiere this season, and next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading league club behind which eight points are lagging.
Prior to that, the European League Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they scored that hit, since their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on the way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head against the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free shot, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisting Menga who hit the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers were mostly in control of the ball, but they faced impenetrable domestic defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
That went on in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
The soles of the goalie Rangers Allan McGregor got in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent a broad blow from another organized attack on Livingstone.
The long additions failed to cross the main line of Livingston, and two 11-year-olds were not sentenced – after Holkett's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one for hand-playing.
“Great” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in the Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent game and the result of Livingstone.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed their expectations on that entry path.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to large clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of a well-organized defense, and Menga wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warral take a breath.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set with a good game under Gerard.
They just opened a hole in the home team once, and it's a kind of invitation to break down for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They differed in opinions on issues involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police blocked for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of presidential supporters came to see him.
And hundreds of protesters against Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- have raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him with a welcome in the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others attack as an autocratic.
Road crash in Deptford: a cyclist fatally killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the Bestwood and Evelyn Street intersection, on a road with a dense traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died on site.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the driver escaped from the scene from the Chiders Street accident, about a mile away from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his next of kin.
As a result of the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motorcar drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in the male prison of a closed guy.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to address riots involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were given assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to resolve the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clearly want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be turned over to the police and that we could spend longer time behind bars."
In Long Lartin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called to prison to address a serious situation where staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential floods (possibly beneficial for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but there is a likelihood that this will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest with the rest of her strength and poses a threat of floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings of floods Monday and Tuesday in the Western Arizona area, through southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with rain and cross over it on Tuesday.
In her tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depression within 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) went 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre provides for 50 to 100 mm precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogolon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest including Stjenjak and the Great Pool there is a likelihood of rainfall of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of floods, Ross could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a major threat, some of these rainfalls could be useful because droughts are currently in the southwest.
"According to the American map of drought areas, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona was affected by at least extreme drought, second highest category," saidweather.com
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Bay California.
On Sunday morning Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and headed north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm encountered colder waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of the tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to floods.
"The amount of total rainfall expected in the Baja California peninsula to the northwest Sonore is from 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is very heavy rain on the Baya California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and torrents of mud in the deserts and slopes in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and in stable condition.
The police administration of Avon and Somerset said that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called to report everyone who has footage of the events.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the evil and rage of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered in the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault tens of years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the indictment hearing she filed.
On Saturday, the president said "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service," he told gathered supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' election in half of the presidential term.
"Five weeks divides us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am," he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democratic mission is to "make resistance and obstruction".
Aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedureal vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were dragged by huge waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when at dusk waves of up to six metres [6 m] hit the coast, dragging many of them to their death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When a tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately and died," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he pulled cars, trunks, houses, hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a water-enclosed mosque.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPTT) announced in its statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake Friday corresponded to the twofold nuclear bomb force dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been torn down.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped beneath the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damages may be more along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in this area," says a Red Cross statement adding staff and volunteers to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building panickingly warning people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall landed on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused the blackout of electricity caused by the interruption of communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, it started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala successfully arrived in the town of Palo where employees were placed in tarpaulin tents in the courtyard of their office, they passed on the scenes of destruction on the way," Mr. Dozeba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palo.
Under Indonesian rules, financing, supply and engagement of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "Okay, it's a national disaster", we can receive international assistance, but this situation has not yet been declared."
When a second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fell at Palo on Friday, friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, the saviors released a woman who had been trapped for two days in ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paraglider community, whatsApp sent desperate messages to competitors from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away 26.750 U.S. dollars while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 U.S. dollars from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in downtown Newport on the Left, according to a press release from the Newport Police Administration.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement said that the car driver was emptying an ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man "came behind Brink's employee in the race" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses have spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police have not listed the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the NYPD in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a Saturday post on Twitter that announced the change, he wrote: "The living being is officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and he used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
Change comes ahead of his visit to the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to launch his new album Yandi.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
Apart from being a shortcut to his current artistic name, West had earlier declared that the word had religious meaning for him.
“I believe that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible that means “you”, West said earlier this year in a conversation on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, meaning “the only one”, in Ye alone – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's the one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And former West's associate, Jay-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a dash and with a dash and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never to use an army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations in that square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people when leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Because China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount invested in research in this area," said an investor in artificial intelligence and an expert in the area of Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans regarding artificial intelligence, although the United States in principle lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"Double increase in the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Double investment increases could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the United States," Lee said this week in talks with the CBS.
Lee, whose book: “AI Great Force: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on the AI system that beat the best American player Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as Defence Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked the question of when next will be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It is not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the Development Plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial resources to people in academic institutions similar to that of the National Foundation for Science and other state organisations providing financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from activity and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment worth $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation that wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Saturday to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has lasted for several decades and has blocked Greece from opening accession negotiations with the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece that claims its northern neighbour's name is the property of its territory and has vetoed the country's NATO and EU entry.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the election boycott campaign cast doubt whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU membership while accepting an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after Yugoslavia's collapse, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, it is our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and welcomed chairs outside the tents set by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, since more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, below the required response.
The second poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-West government's policies since taking office in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is going through the entire Brighton defense to score a hit.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday, England, and won 2:0 for Manchester City.
Aguero's victory made it insanely simple, reaching a 65-minute hit.
Argentina's attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He made it through three Brighton defense players and then made it to the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders, then overtook them several more at the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
An English gunman from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero, who threw the right ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with his foot," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in defeating the Premier League.
That hit was made in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field during that game.
He added a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before he pointed Sterling towards the stand.
Sky Blues' attacker threw a ball into the net just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City is fighting the Hoffenheims in a team game of champions Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Germany's Syncheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the progress of Rockies
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one match over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, come to play.
On Friday evening, the Rockies won 5-2 over the Nationals at least secured a place in the wild-card play, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still need to announce Sunday's starter, but reportedly they tend to offer Scherzer a game.
Sherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher area Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The D.C. right-wing score in this season was 18-7, the average win-win (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
During the speech on the importance of Republican voters' turnout in the general elections, the president has always commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge.
"Everything we have done will be tested in November.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control; that's why they want power and control; we won't give them control."
Democrats, he says, have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You have seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt and lying".
He praised Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee by name, causing a loud disdain for the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document. It was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
Does not tolerate personal attitudes
It didn't surprise me too much when the Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of representatives of the Labour Party who have been told that they are not welcome – and all because we have said what is on our mind.
According to my co-legislators, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbin disagreed with the previous leadership.
The notation of the Labour Party's Nottingham branch meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as the Labour Party's local representative, meetings of the main council on Friday evenings were just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings have been held today in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since the associates I thought shared similar political opinions began to require me to change their views drastically and to take positions I would never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there are a bunch of offensive words on social networks calling for my recall, which deny the policies of the centre and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I've received are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the avalanche of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never stop.
One of the aspects of this political era that has most disappointed me is to tolerate offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal on mistrust or change of election rules, we become an increasingly narrow party.
Many times in the last two years, I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and tell me that then everything will be okay."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school multi-purpose classroom to collapse, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilman or minister in government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in my last election.
No one in Nottingham's branch could have been fooled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country grabs to Brexit which will negatively affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire for time and energy to be lost to my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituency, whether it's about members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political benefit will deter me from doing what I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heads to the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and are the only ones undefeated by ten teams.
After all, the ultimate defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tried at every game and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, "Well done to Ayru, they took opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Anderson in 14 minutes that Frazier Climo realized enabled Ayr to lead, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the results, and Jason Baggot took the unrealised attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership to the eleventh before, at the very halftime, scored a hit and realized an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr to 17:5 a.m.
But Melrose began his second half well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggott, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then came the long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott that they took on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall, who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced an extra player to pay, and this unrealised attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
A lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card to tear down the AC that didn't have a ball; with the line for a criminal blow, MacPherson made a lay behind Ayra in a full swing of penetration.
Climo realized that he had done it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took a high blow from David Armstrong and sent a lateral player to Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt at the home team.
The Still Game series star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it has been discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in his favorite BBC series, whose screenwriter is one of the stars, along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming season nine would be the last to appear, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in "a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will grant it a way out to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the sea center full of cranes in La Paz.
There was a flag of ocean color hanging on public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are winged: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favor of Chile during the 19th century conflict is still alive – just as the longing for the re-floating of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1st, after a five-year procedure, these hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians around the country will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the deviation of the sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here is Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are near the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if that were the case.
The UN-based body in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Just because the International Court of Justice ruling comes only six months after the final hearings means that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
Instead of promoting the interest of Bolivia, the last four years may have turned them back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric has buried every goodwill of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has reached an unusually fast decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime issue as a political crutches.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to get through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be disarmed if he couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
Comments were sent at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be prone to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions continued because of "despaired imagination" and that US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will by no means throw the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want to meet at the top.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of the Pyongyang to give up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of large head coverings on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely cover the sun, do not look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the fashion runway a line of loose giant head coverings for their spring and summer collection 2019 and delighted the fans of style at the Paris week fashion.
Extraordinarily impractical hats this summer were washed by Instagram, and these designers sent their creations that attracted attention to the runway.
The example that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is about a large beige hat decorated with a wide circumference similar to feathers that has completely “taken over” the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jewelry - decorated watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but these accessories are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like an ice cream cone.
If you follow the big fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stillists predict that giant hats could come to a luxury store in your neighborhood.
The huge hats perfectly fit with the heels “La Bomb”, a straw hat with a width of approximately 60 cm which was seen on many celebrities, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind an extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks on a fashion runway sent another big creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
The orange rafium bag, decorated with raffia bars and white leather lunch, was an exhibition copy of the summer collection Jacqeumus' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
"I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops for the following summer. Since the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories."
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exams, and additional weights give individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are working to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them to the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above mentioned school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the finals this year show that the highest language scores were achieved by independent school students.
A total of 68% of students learning foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent assessment for Mandarin, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of Spanish also received the highest rating possible.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today languages are considered just as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools, as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom of Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill their jobs due to lack of labour skills with language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of young people for careers.
Because more and more jobs require knowledge of language, these skills are crucial in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak foreign language in the future will experience the benefits of such a long - term skill.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with foreigners, and this gives her an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
So investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, each school offers various languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their program, while others will choose languages that are considered most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professional in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which learning will prepare and arm the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for us.
It is not possible to ignore the fact that in today’s global business language knowledge is very important for the future of each country so that it must also reflect on education.
Hence, the knowledge of modern languages should indeed be viewed as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.

LeBron will first play in Lakers' uniform in San Diego on Sunday
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Laker's coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But there's still no telling how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the official page of Lakers.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in the Lakers that consist of six matches.
"I really don't need pre-seasonal matches at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned gatherings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the November vote.
What time does Trump's meeting in West Virginia begin tonight, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern Time, tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be viewed online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearing of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who have caused controversy over sexual abuse charges.
But the primary goal of this series is to help Republicans gain the advantage of the November elections.
Therefore, Trump's campaign headquarters report that five meetings scheduled for next week aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to hold and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Most in Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as possible as we enter a burning campaign," an anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohi and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month. In 2016 he won more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve the ranking in polls," political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team left its heart on the ground before Sunday’s single clashes
After three one-sided couples clashes on Sunday afternoon, maybe it's exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to turn.
"The wheel of happiness is turning" is a phrase that is particularly valid in sports and which athletes believe in, and especially in competitions such as this.
Who likes the wheel of happiness now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead with four points, while there are 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says that the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouraged his game in pairs with Justin Thomas, with which he won three out of four points after the whole day's game.
Spieth played murderous from the Tee to the Greens and can serve as an example to others.
Cheerleading celebrations grew louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth got to the draw.
A similar cheerleading scream followed the way he won the 15-hole game, in which hope and belief can be recognized that Americans can turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for those players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of Ryder Cup.
A European strange but adorable couple has a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who did not lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back ninjas on Friday morning.
This winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, shows that they are just the players to be defeated on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the European victory as the sun sets over the Paris-based Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at different holes at the same time.
But it is still too soon to talk about the European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergi Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the playground buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't dig out of.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one who will help individuals dig themselves out of their holes.
It is fascinating to watch games of couples up close because you can see the interactions of players in pairs, hear the tips they give and those they don't give, and study the strategy that can change in a moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary struggle, which some, in particular, the States had doubts about.
The last day of the Europeans Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10:6
After Saturday's couples' games on the last day, Ryder Cup enters with a significant advantage over the United States of America of 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led with four points of difference on Le Golf National.
The European Thomas Bjorn team, in an effort to win the trophy it escaped in Hazeltine two years ago, was superior to the American team in the morning games in couples, achieving a score of 3: 1.
The American team has shown greater fighting in couples by winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
To win the Jim Furyk trophy, eight points should be collected in 12 single games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debuter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Mollywood", are after a sensational weekend only the second couple who won four points in the match in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods who did not show the best performance on two Saturdays played some brilliant moves, but now has 19 losses of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to go back in the game with his partner Henry Stanson and to suffer a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans did not go all the way smooth during a pleasant day southeastern of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday to set the rankings high for their American team.
First, they defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Potter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in all history, Ryder Cupa's team, which was four points behind, managed to get back into individual games, although Fury's team only needs a draw in order to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, it seems that Sunday's counter-attack will be difficult for them.
North Korea announced that "no way" for unilateral disarmament without trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill last year", for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, disarmed the nuclear testing station and made a decision to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory reaction from the United States," he added.
"If we do not trust in the United States, we have no faith in our national security either. Under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first unilaterally disarmed."
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints made by North Korea on Washington's resistance to "produced" denuclearisation in order to gradually abolish sanctions in North Korea, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as he did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end a Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned to give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for reducing strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that denuclearisation be carried out before that and increase pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is only the delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump that the US president spoke about in the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister stressed that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearisation had sought South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill."
Regardless, the tone of speech by Minister Ria was very different from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with rockets was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim "a human rocket" on a suicidal mission.
Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that many more work is to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearised.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no timeframe for denuclearisation and added, "It doesn't matter if it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have voiced the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an effort to stop the financing of the nuclear and ballistic programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN's main assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster requirements".
North Korea has set up a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex that will be realised if the United States takes "responsible measures".
He added that Kim revealed that these "response measures" refer to security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to learn how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to fight an ever-expanded learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, designed a course he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of the course came after giving a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of my class, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I only find out this now, at the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," The Telegraph told him.
For the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services Paul Barreira says the University has decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed with students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a dormitory where students must click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how the lack of sleep affects success and how important sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn that long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a map of campuses with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on all-night learning before exams continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that secret weapons of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps to fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry student and biology student in California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand his course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during their sleep, as well as during their awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” that are broadcast by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadialic rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the Dolly Menge hit Steven Gerrard's faulty defense and ended the game by beating Livingstone with a score of 1 :0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win first after the triumph in February and results 4 :1 at St. Johnston, but the Gary Holt team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team is now eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to have lost their inspiration and did not seem to equalize the result.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingstone climbed third with only one hit of the difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence suffered a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on his hips so he ran past Ayr to the batfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same piece of Livingston that took the measure to the Hearts last week, and he would be thrilled that his well-designed configuration was stifling every attempt by an opponent.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingstone did more with it.
They had a chance to hit it two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game that opened Scott Pittman's space to head for the goal of Allan McGregor, however, the volumer missed that opportunity.
The deep free blow of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise blow to the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to be playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that the judge was supposed to give him an 11-minute sentence in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson failed to respect Colombian demands.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to score only two balls to the goal, but the former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly had one blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and the pitted blow of this Eyaria was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute game of Livingston has slowed down the game, no one can deny it.
The Rangers have again failed to use Jacobs' deep return ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his integrity and chose Menga to simply end the attack.
Gerard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an immediate effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett scored one long blow after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide entrance from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an 11-year-old because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away this time too.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor · Global Voices
And now we have a website from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and several days ago ...the day of birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from that invention later developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has also become the main stronghold of pop culture, for example in the 1950 Bells of Colorado, where the main roles were played by seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this, for God's sake?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system that it recognises bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
The cells are treated so that they can “recognize” protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injection into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify bad cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient, their changes in the laboratory to know “recognition” of protein called HER2 which is common to many types of cancer and re-injection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in the state of Bethlehem in the state of Maryland said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 encourages the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and learning them how to identify cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
After visiting Saturday Night Live, Kanye West took part in a debate about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was staged in a studio during Saturday Night Live after a show of interruptions that praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President 2020.
After performing a third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the US Senate's Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's claims of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a video of West's speech was transmitted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
There's no telling if the publication of Rock was trying to mock West.
Also, the West complained to the public that he had been approached behind the stage for the hat he was wearing.
"I was harassed behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been bullied!
They said I sank," says Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the bottom?", and said he would wear his Superman cloak because that means I can't tell him what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments at least twice caused public disdain, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: “The whole studio was quiet.”
West was called at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
By performing the song “I love it”, dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, he amazed many.
The West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "One of the people with the bravest spirit: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West simply "was itself and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now "be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, which is also known under the names Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and, of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed the name into a symbol, and then into an artist previously known as Prince.
A charge of attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder of a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant is scheduled to appear at the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
The star of the series Game of Thrones Kit Harrington leaned on toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow who handles the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But a 31-year-old actor went for a stereotype of macho hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they must be firm to gain respect.
Speaking for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie of the Game of Thrones, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" to face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this point – where did we make a mistake with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men, as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male characters on screen, could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets and boys feel that they must have these certain traits of a man?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our era – how can we change that?
Because apparently for boys something went wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the sequels of the Game of Thrones after its completion next summer and said he "had finished with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will be starring in a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened to him during the filming of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife by recording that show, which gave me a family and a future life," he discovered.
Rose is in a fantastic show that won the Emmy Award playing the role of Ygritte, the love of the whale character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS has increased.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV has been rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV is almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a large one.
Studies estimate that because of the conservative values in the country 70 - 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to deal with the problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has given up information about the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiring theories"
US representative Maxine Walters denied Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal data from three Republican US senators on Wikipedia's pages.
A Democratic MP from Los Angeles assures that the claims are spread by individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as by websites.
"Lying, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network Thursday, and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the Senate committee's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by candidates of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court.
Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of publication of this data belongs to the office of Agent Waters, as well as information about the representative's staff member, the newspaper The Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“My staff member – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is by no means responsible for the leak of these data.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do can't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
It must be calm and steady."
Fleischer appeared to compare Barbara Walters' reaction to criticism that the Democrats are referring to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing against Waters in general elections, also appeared on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office informed the ‘recording authorities and law enforcement bodies’ about these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous for my entire cabinet," she continued.
Reviews of the film "Johnny English: Again on the Task" – not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spies
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new screenplay of the action series "Johnny English" whose first follow-up titled "Johnny English" was shown for the first time in 2003 and returned to large screens titled "Johnny English again riding".
Will a twisted own satire about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English eyes and rubber face are again licensed for a more complicated situation, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, an outcast secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretenses of "diluted" glamour resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a breath of Mr Bean's character and somewhat resembles the guy who sang a note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His character is also inspired by a traveller and a mysterious world man who Atkinson once played in now forgotten TV commercials for Barclay and who is the image of chaos.
There are one or two convenient moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually excessive, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "imposable missions" and themselves offer elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, the crazy events of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's mute gegs embodied in Mr Bean's image.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy web network and discovered the identities of all British agents, the horror of an agent on duty, which, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon plays in a short appearance.
This has shed a glass of the Prime Minister's patience, a pompous and warring figure who is experiencing a complete collapse of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully display a character who is supposed to represent Theresa May, but she hasn't received much material to do with it.
Intelligence consultants reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard who is currently employed as the principal of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here there are several handsome geoffs because English teaches rock-style spying.
Englisha is quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where she meets again with Bough, her former partner and her eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal wife of Opheli Bullet, who was embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey along with absurd and ridiculous events: disguised as waiters a burning fancy French restaurant, challenge a huge mess smuggling on Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes a complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything has been done right for this last sequel, but as attractive and flaunty as it is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English movies, I wonder again if the British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Labour party denies working out a plan that the British work four days a week and get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan under which the British would work four days a week and be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to forward savings incurred by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be "accompanied" in the party's economic programme and plans for the country to bow to workers' interests.
The union congress supported the transfer to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the daily "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be realized overnight, but represents a tendency that fits the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept the move.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power from the hands of the "no faceless directors" and the "profitter" in utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their overall stakes because the Labour government could make "deductions" on the basis of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10 per cent of private companies' capital to employees, which would earn an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and asks whether the Agency's conclusion can affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going to the debate, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they brought you out, and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, hesitant, hesitant."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it really should be a strong accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the persons she has appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything's changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything about poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of events, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Coverty Project project, an international advocacy group, hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful means of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand an invitation to action, or just another case called "clitivism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending tweets really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters seeking to achieve a range of different goals.
He argues that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would lead to more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key obligations include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and contractors in the United Kingdom that advocates “to help children develop to their full potential”, with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from world citizens, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a footnote in history," said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the "The Power of Nutrition" Foundation, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult road . Sometimes we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, as did the great movements for civil rights and against apartheids before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances by Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong to some of the performances at this year's event in New York to be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports by Interior Minister
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke said that the Russian engagement in Syria is especially where he acts on the call of the legitimate government to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
In his opinion, however, there are ways and means to address this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure open seaways and roadblocks, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by the non-profit consumer Energy Alliance group, which is represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he told Russia that he "uses the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as Trump's administration's intention to increase the exports of its intrinsic natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "capital" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industrys (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrys (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says state senator Massachusetts
State Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the bid for president after the medium-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office herself.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that implies a woman at the helm," The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren voiced her opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying "this country is heading in the wrong direction".
"I am terribly concerned that Donald Trump is doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of the vote for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed over a potential race for the president in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying for September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence that took place Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are returning to," she told audiences at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he is silent about both his son and other war veterans said they "return a little different, return hard, come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence against a woman's personality, obstructing the application of domestic violence and possession of arms in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, spokesman for the police administration of the town of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support revising new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the legal challenge of a new US policy that deprives asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the US Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom came from asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States changed the decision of the Immigration Committee, which allowed immigrants who do not have documents and who are fleeing from domestic violence, to apply for asylum.
Columbia County State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignorates decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law states that all asylum applications are resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle," a report by a court friend said.
Lawyers further claimed that the policy that deprives immigrants of their entry is damaging the US economy, arguing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on politics on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum has never been to mitigate all problems . Even all the serious problems people face daily worldwide.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Ris Kusuma, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
‘Emergency vehicles shall bring bodies every minute.
The government lacks clean water."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, gathering through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered a fracture in his back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continuing severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was bent inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "maltreating" through "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of a long ad in the US daily that promoted the mutual benefit of US and Chinese trade, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing US press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China Daily's paid newspaper supplement in Iowa's most sold-out newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the US congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials have described as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's revenges early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor Iowa, China's main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad said China "now doubles this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at a newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited votes of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the disturbing Chinese economic pathway because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspapers are.
Kavanaugh's debacle Republicans distanced voters from mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans stand next to a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and defend him for several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite alarmed, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to cast their voice.
Such things cannot return," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, told an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's latest insistence (R-Arizon) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"The women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," the newspaper in Washington, D.C., quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, as saying on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang, "Comes November!" protesting in the Senate corridor while Republicans who control the Judicial Committee were preparing to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the news.
"People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in suburban and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by candidates for a Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest there might be a negative reaction if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
"It's a real mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, NBC News said.
"It's not just about voting on the board or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about the way the Republicans approached all of it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new poll published by YouG shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe in the truthfulness of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh safely or possibly believe it.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations that Ford made, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where they store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is "World Domination".
"We must do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network storage" or "pod".
It may include contact lists, list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access which information is completely user-wide.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to develop their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a complete change in which all their business models would completely turn overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a publication published on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as it runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, World Wide Web Foundations and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration for the Medal of Priests from World War I Victoria Cross · Global Voices
Celebrates in honor of the only priest of the Church of England , decorated with Victoria's cross as a fighter in World War I , was arranged in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29th 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honor.
A memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he received that recognition.
According to the London Gazette Official Journal, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentin's channel "through a very dense fog and under strong fire coming from the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he hurried into the front row and with "incredible courage" led the unit forward before chasing a Polish cannon without anyone's help and cutting down three of the military troops.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918... just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know that I could never achieve, which arouses humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also passed a wedding after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated through the support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Piglet Peppa
Imagine this ? Stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually prevent you from tracking the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live on channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Great Britain remained in shock when the transmission was interrupted by Praščić Peppa.
Many were not impressed after only the struggle left them awake until early morning.
One fan of the break-up with a children's cartoon on Twitter described it as a "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6am, so they had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice president of Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Yuppie, Peppa Pig."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would reconcile his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider replaying, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to realise anything until Sunday comes to us, when they will have it Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six, which is what we do, and we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
An Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he left for high school he was not aware that "not everyone was like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympic Games has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-standing show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of the disease.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said, "To date, these feelings of inferiority and diversity were the real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed."
He says he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something," so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who advocated LGBT persons and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth's Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he believes he is happy that he can live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said that his age difference was never a problem.
“When so young you go through so much” he looked back on his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later” he said it was hard to find someone in the same age and had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing out, and only when he stopped breathing and died, did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life "to jump in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to select the first song by Heather Small, who echoed in the song during the preparation for the Olympic Games and on which it always creeps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to return to his form completely to avoid the awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12th time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and developing his game at the gym in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where a long uneven terrain routinely punishes inexact blows.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson faces the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who won all four matches this week with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, get to the hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man . . more than that and couldn't tell.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There is a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine he was playing two games.
I imagined there would be more of them, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's how we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence also brought certain immaterial values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the single match Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane debuted in a match in Valderram in 1997, where the team of Captain Seva Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 14° 13°.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the team 2018, which won the score 5 °3 on Friday and yesterday led the result of 10°6 in the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full force tomorrow.
Get out in the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors come out on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that remains a focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who is standing opposite us by the greatest players in the world."
Delighted by the performance of his players on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run before the ore in this.
Tomorrow we must face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the main individual performance, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as an individual, they're at the final exam of your golfer's ability.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and she's that tomorrow they have to do their best.
Now leave your teammate because he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these major shifts on the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that rush starts in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our setup and placed the boys as if, you know, we were going to try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counter attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for individual matches.
German new warship put on hold again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be launched in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, the leading ship of the brand-new bachelor-Wuertemberg frigates, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after the delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four of the Baden-Wuertemberg vessels, which the Navy ordered since 2007, will replace the old Bremen frigates.
As far as it is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period . It should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the ports of origin.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which are said to be able to demonstrate power abroad, will already become obsolete by the time we enter the service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after the delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make a warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by crews of about 120 sailors half the size of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is dramatically too heavy to reduce its efficiency and restricts the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project is also becoming a problem, including crew training.
It is said that the price has reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) than the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy is in fact "exhausting ships capable of deployment".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as old ships were put out of operation and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the bachelor class frigates of Baden-Würtemberg could join the Navy.
The National Foundation listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the property in Scotland aims to discover how bats use landscapes in hunting for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will be followed by ordinary and swamped dwarf bats, as well as brown long-earned and river bats in Inverewa gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile examinations using hand detectors.
The professional analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind it does.
Then a map of habitats and reports will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom decreased significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and construction work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night-hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on the course of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten bats that live in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there is much more that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us understand better what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work within buildings, since the accidental destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young women, likely destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population is progressing. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as "false news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Derbach, who published those charges.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Derbach reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers several hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
"They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is good," added the football player with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Derbach over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy", Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years."
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the football room, where she was allegedly anally raped, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after an alleged incident and told her that "99%" was a "good guy" who was failed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "scared of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 40-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she remains traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italy's 100m-euro giant.
Brexit: UK Will "Repent Forever" to Lose Car Producers · Global Voices
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses world leader status after Brexit in car production, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told BBC that, in the event Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of waiting at borders in the Brexit case could cause job losses without agreement.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my view that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, we will experience a halt in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement over possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer concerns the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement being reached.
Toyotina's production line operates according to the "right on time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at the border that industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire couldn't hold more supplies than those needed for a day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only maintaining current success, but also taking advantage of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4's programme told today.
"The evidence not only of the Toyota, but also of other manufacturers show that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful series of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked 24 years in Burnaston and is a member of the Union, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs have gone away, they never return.”
The government spokesman says, "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could "reschedul another week" as the fight continues over the candidate for Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the elections, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy state's attorney, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been spouting gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing carrying a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
On questions about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week considering everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference at the White House on September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not the result of a reluctance to "theatrical behaviour" by television reporters, although she said, "I will not stand up to the fact that they are being distracted."
Then she suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organises more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without stating evidence: "We have analysed the figures."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make this happen often, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short addresses to journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the crowd of journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scots NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter not full six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
The United Kingdom government, however, also strengthens preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Friends from across the EU, as well as beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie under emergency surgery after head injury
Line player team Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after suffering head injury in Saturday's defeat by the Windsor Commodores Club with a score of 31  - 27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the halftime.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before they put him on a stretcher and sent him on further tests.
A representative of Tennessee State State State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there are no "type/obsession details" and that Tennessee State is trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year game internship, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shootings before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
The move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in the fee will be charged by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added to the current tax, including the increase introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issuing , can be up to 3 percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise £120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not have UK residence, which increases prices and makes it difficult for customers who buy the first real estate to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the fee to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not taking advantage of the country, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable properties to repair "a disgrace over the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbin announced proposing a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the end of zero-provoked raids.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as worthy British.
The dream of having a home has become far too far away, and the shame of homelessness remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end-of-life ambition" is one day becoming the governor of Scotland.
Scots (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after again taking St. Mirren to the Scottish Football Championship last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only come true if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's place include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
Former Chief Alloa Athletica says he felt no fear because he inherited such famous names in such a big club, after having previously rejected calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this point will be measured against whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again."
Ross ends only the third year of his management career, after which he was the assistant chief of Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the winner of next season's champion title.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real intersection," remembered Alloa's takeover.
"I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I've been doing well, making a solid living and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure work, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, according to research.
The summer heat wave increased revenues to British pubs who struggled with finance, but raised pressure on restaurant chains.
Data show that pubs and bars achieved an increase in revenues in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants were reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of Chief Business Book Controller, who collected data, said: “The continuation of good weather and participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of the pubs rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now even more affected.
A 1.8% drop in restaurant revenues in June only deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mainly served have achieved much greater gains on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mainly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the run-up pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased 6.6 per cent during the month, while the sale of food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst with RSM for rest and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the decline in sales of 4.8% at annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food leaders, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give us the necessary rest."
The total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the share of brands.

One in five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
The 20 000 high school students survey showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
News heightened fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account showing their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts reference to the photo sharing website.
The news has heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they were using a cleaned "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged other words "rape me".
The study, conducted by the Digital Aware UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, showed that 40 percent of students aged 11–18 have two profiles, half of which acknowledges that they own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athlete" on the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a board member," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the race at 200m and 400m in the 1996 games in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, could no longer walk after the transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was arduous, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today to practice agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the Internet about the advert for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors by its advertising of mothers breastfeeding their children compared to cows that are encouraged by husbands has shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's first silent carrying traitor", Elvie's consumer technology company published an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music that reads, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a wink, it's my breasts."
Then comes the chorus: "Pulse, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, pump, milk your ladies."
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it lights up the "horrible" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are being stolen a few days after birth," one person wrote.
The Elvie traitor discreetly fits the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Absolutely traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone said, "A totally lame commercial."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was “funful. ”
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Selling milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial aimed at mothers who issue milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like a ‘ cow’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of a campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the release.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the Mother Agency, commented: “The Elvie traitor is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put focus on publishing and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor would bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's traitor made the cover.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on a fashion runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it difficult to accommodate children under sponsor's care.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albance, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been recorded in criminal records.
"Nearly 80% of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's sponsorship are illegal, and many of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, with the aim of faster implementation of the procedure for children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was earlier standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not in person, to present their legal status case to the immigration court.
Those who fail to meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to statements by shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
The advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that the signs of the child’s being overlooked will be overlooked.
They added that moving children into a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the exception of fighting terrorism, and would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "expanding irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the latest large rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with Russia's support on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra fronts related to al-Qaeda, "to be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of a new board of cabinet members and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 reelection unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, recall and scandal, his presidency ends prematurely.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, ratings have doubled more than to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's show "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the nights of the main news broadcast.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said the ABC drama producer "Designated Survivors", about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Skivell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied: “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories that come from Washington can determine the future of the law on abortion of the origin of the Roe versus Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you exceed the level of the informed citizen when you catch yourself watching for the sixth hour a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of “deep background” for his book “Fear”, about Paul Manafort’s Noah’s 15 000 - dollar (“the clothing item filled with arrogance”, writes Washington Post), and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, of Mr Trump’s anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Maria again.
"Part of what he makes you feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Publishery", about the rotating performance and the daily complications of Trump's show (fighting with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you'll be behind.
When I reached Fleissa this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and shooting CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate's Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung on to the end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside is left in the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania County is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reconstruction of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reorganized district of the suburban part of Pittsburgh highlights Democratic Conor Lamba, who won second place last spring in the special elections.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania County, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally tailored for Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign fight between the main party fundraising parties, the Committee that raises funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broadly monitored March 18th district elections.
For more than a decade, the position was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave a minor advantage to the Democrats.
The United States wants to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then retreat.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to "recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
However, the fines were considered only against El Salvador, which received estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, inter alia, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progressing in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus ended any consideration of the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next item could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on the possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which now has very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our election.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to re-emerge in front of the voters, and perhaps ultimately and with the jury of the equal.
There's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trum's inevitable fall - or those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, only that the West would stand up to him and support the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he secretly proposed to shoot the president last year and speculated on his incompetence for service.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair "or if it has been confirmed for the Supreme Court despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote in the middle-term elections for Congress that will call Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter sleep.
But I don't think we're gonna fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light candles for a Sabbath on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid in Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over Austrians, after an impressive remium in Spain against Villarrell early this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League group.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans's garter from showing up for the first time in the season to remium 2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled the score.
We may have been able to steal the game in the end, but in general, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
It's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team's good and the boys really enjoy it; the training's good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of the nationwide study respondents said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Cooperate with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, for these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Please include your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-certainty with your own wealth .
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the root.
Enlist healthcare professionals to determine a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details of the plan in writing to be ready.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Hold that plan by your hand."
A man shot multiple times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by shots from an air rifle returning home after a night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, and an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
Since communications were cut off, the aid officers could not obtain any information from the Donggale province, areas north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was struck by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 km of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the Sulawesi province economy, especially the coastal regions of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The Great Earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of the Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake hit the Pidia Jay region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the fall of buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sara Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, former governor of Alaska's eldest son and vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstruction of family violence and resisting arrest, a report published on Saturday by a state police officer in Alaska said.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and is detained on an unsecured $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course", the network reported on the plea.
Palina is charged with three Class A violations, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is being punished on one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time you've filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of the registration of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off, and a rise in the number of deaths is expected in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the immediate proximity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentences for a terrorist suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City where eight people were killed, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to attack a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he cut off pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted a serious physical injury, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both points lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of Saipov hit a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of murder and extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," according to a statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York was last prosecuted by the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York, 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
conservative member of parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics since one of the members of parliament Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
conservative representative Peter Bone told the procession in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been "out" by now that Mr. Farage was secretary to Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciliation of her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Toryans who tend to join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of an attack by supporters of Brexit, supporters of the rest of the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its attempts to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite its reactions and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its packages and "kaosa".
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihul that he wanted to "refuse the Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should have received the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must throw out the Chequers."
Voicing his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their minds and wanted to remain completely incorrect."
The conservative and supporter, Brexit Andrea Jenkins, was also in the procession, addressing reporters with the words: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added, "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told crowds that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are about to let down a decision taken at a 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us ? people ? and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it won't work."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of the issue of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-administered, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Many activists waved with "Torici v. Brexit" banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are people telling us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the uninterrupted state of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans "to seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would " seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democratics spoke of her future Saturday for direct association with citizens in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been at the centre of speculation for some time now so she can stand up to Trump in 2020.
A meeting Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that implies a woman in charge."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death result of a State University basketball player in Louisiana (LSU) Wade Sims who took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police released information about the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20) at 11am at a conference for ET journalists.
On Friday, they posted a video of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near campus at the University of Southern.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene and owning the murder weapon and killing Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student of 198 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in 10 first sets last season and average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion's title after the order guarantees him victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a great role in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the beginning, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vetel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action wheel on the wheel, which caused Ferrari's driver to reluctantly leave free interior at risk of lagging behind after a double move in the defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while relying on his tires to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a rough day since Valteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and she's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a really remarkable job to achieve a formal finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at Saturday's rally because of her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse.
Addressing the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and mean and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the publications and leaks of information to the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - 'ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had arrived from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations Dr. Ford, I did not release her story to the public," Feinstein said to the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret, which she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come up with the approval of the president, who at Saturday night's meeting commented: "Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats use these charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to restore power at any cost.
You see wickedness, disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5  - 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants versus Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for losing the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the Dundee on Saturday at 5'3".
The Giants came to the advantage of two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer in the early minutes.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie led domestically to equality, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equaled for Dundee before two of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for the Adam Keefe team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with a score of 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season of the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening of the game arrived in the fourth minute, more specifically at 3:35 p.m., by the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, along with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by hitting Beauvilleer four minutes later.
In the rush opening of the game, Sullivan returned home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt enabled Cawnie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The natives regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in measuring the force with a goal at 2737.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen for the first lead of Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team had already been halfway through the last third of the game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes teams in the next game Friday.
The air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of the aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are reported missing after a major earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues’ escape to save their lives, however, the 21-year-old Antoineus Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara airport control tower Sis Al Jufre who was rocking hard.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He passed away later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpan, Kalimantan, to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are breaking because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of people killed could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongali, Sigi and Boutongu is limited.
"It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, since many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves reaching a height of up to six metres destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "The ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
There's a lack of clean water.
Small stores are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing for survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lombok struck Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Minnesota: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a lagoon plane crash
The airline that owns the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota now claims that one man is being led missing, after all 47 passengers and crew members were said to have been safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon I cannot trace one of the passengers.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
Which caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to break through the water that reached their waist to the exits in case the plane went down.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair the docks also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane went down in about 30 metres of water.
Data from the Air Force Security Network indicate that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugina.
Analyst exposes the time-vision of the night in which the woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up the case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the US Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described him using cell phone data to compose a puzzle about the movements of a 29-year-old indictee named Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "sullied because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that he said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers died, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from the phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the closing word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed singing group in Bristol claims hip-hop music has strayed from its beginnings filled with political messages and referring to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in the UK through artists like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after getting a misspelled message from a mother in which she is called "another black woman".
The couple deny being racists, comparing the charge with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out on her first day of work in 2016 that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NOEE Another black woman," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, she twice sent her to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "unfortunate" situation and fired Mrs. Maurice for claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had been doing her job badly, and had been expecting the Filipino woman for her instead, transferred to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and demanding $350 a day compensation for a six-month period for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I cannot do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying the end of Maurice's employment was reasonable to do, amid fears that she would not be able to be trusted later.
"My wife did not mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It is difficult to put in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and grief after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "a very important member of the family", added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and wasn't a boaster," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything has been seen as some achievement of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
Though it was about his work and his imagination, he always credited credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
"Hope has regularly called to say it is really bad and that they believe it will not get away," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she will die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be joining you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that her doctors gave her to maintain her heart function were slowly losing their effect and leaving her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then everything went out.
All I had to do was sit around and wait and know what would come next.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers - who were unaware of the temptation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears flowed down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a bright career.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before he died, however, he left the job because he was in a "real dark state".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found a brother after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards "so people know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom of it. When the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eyes or want anything else."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they must overcome it: “All of this leaves a great gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we'll keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at an end as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we might be able to bring in a little unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for, a time-limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "disintegrating" in the middle of a rooted party blockade.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is fueled by the choice of the moment.
The medium-term elections will arrive in just five weeks, November 6th, if Republicans are not expected to go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the country's highest court elections.
George W. Bush repeatedly calls on the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his vote and confirm his position at the Supreme Court.
The number of defections from North Korea is falling under Kim's leadership
The number of defections from North Korea dropped after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the US ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 defects last year compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that key factors are stricter control at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers defections illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South , which are still technical in the war , have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearisation.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work on the release of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is not possible that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerical", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court "histeric" and said she was unable to serve in the Supreme Court due to her temperament.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would have called her 'histeric'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, calling the indictments against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated inkling" organised by the liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if he'd try to call Kavanaugh off if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats got most of it in the House of Representatives, Pelosi gave way.
"I will tell the next one , if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not capable not only of being in the Supreme Court, but also of the court he is now in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that as a democratic, she is concerned about the potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Accessive Care or the law on the abortion of the stemming from the Roe v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, anger that's been collected for months and years, can't be solved without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be executive director and who said how she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they're basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated, is how, once when I cried for unspeakable anger, an older woman, a cold manager who I always feared, dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and Seven Dwarves".
Since the campaign had already moved away, it was lagging behind in fundraising, and she vowed not to enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, gave her only 250 dollars.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying she wasn't going to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration of a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexism to shake her throat.
"You'd think if I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder remembered the media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The start of a trade war between the United States and China echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between countries may benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation in this week has emerged with new customs duties affecting $200 billion (150 billion) products, actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has reciprocated each time, and recently introduced customs from five to ten percent on 60 billion U.S. goods.
China has promised that the United States will respond with a blow, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not surrender soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by undermining requirements, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays his cards well, US trade war pressures can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic downturn in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking that focused on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed by a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 · 10.5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown while Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during the almost entire tournament, sent a ball to the water on the 16th hole of the couple 3, leaving the match to Francesco Molinarija.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all rounds and became one of the four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament began this format.
American Jordan Spieth was expelled by Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost two and one to Ian Poulter's Englishman who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most victory in the tournament with 25.5 points won in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop the tears.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, full of emotions after European victory.
He's passing the torch on to his countryman John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2&1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been fighting the weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll work our way through, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Board, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to people.
We're outplayed."
New data on red tide: concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Commission on the conservation of fish and the floral and animal world (FWC) shows a general decrease in red tide levels in parts of Tampa Bay Bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions for heterogeneous algia bloom are reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier regions, indicating a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
