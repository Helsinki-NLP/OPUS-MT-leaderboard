Speaking French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
Spring's late this year.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.

I think that's yours.
Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
That's Tom's.
I'll come, too.

I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They get along well with their neighbors.
Tom didn't say anything about that?
French isn't that hard to learn.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your house.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's the point?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd have a pretty good time.
I forgot his name.
We're in no hurry.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale live.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I'm not going to ask him.

We always look forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love kids, don't you?

I think we need to find out who Tom's planning on giving it to.
Unbelievable!
That's all you can really do.
It's time we got a good-bye.
France is bordering Italy.

I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Show us.
There's nothing wrong with the plan.

The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.

I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was nowhere else to go.
The man pushed her aside.
A hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We waited with a weak expectation.
I hear Boston was pleasant this time of year.
What's your nickname?

That drawing is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that made her angry.
That's too small.
I've never seen you here before.
Coming here was a mistake.
He was wounded in the crash.
The question now is how.
I like to speak French.
There have been widespread rumors of defeat.
It's very short.
Stop going back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in time if everyone else is late?
The rush of the wind was blowing rain directly into my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be pleased.
That's no problem.
Did you tip?
Looks like nobody's home.
I'm gonna have to cancel that application.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?

What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.

I intend to win.
Many of the children were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a Hamal firm to get their stuff to their new address.

Tom wasn't into it.
This guide may be of use to you on your journey.
Is your watch true?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like gardening.
They've been talking coffee for over two hours.
It's an honor to be here.

Watch where you're going.

I have to admit, I was worried.
You don't seem very happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is an interesting profession.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I'm not betting anymore.
It's my brother's.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom buttoned his shirt.
I don't remember sending that letter.
Why does he seem angry?
Tom speaks French.

It's okay.
Tom won't be at the bank at the time.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Looks like you've achieved considerable success since the last time I saw you.
The station's downtown.
Don't even bother coming.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like the way you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The object is outside the scope of this investigation.
You're sitting right where I am.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you were coming.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.
Although I'm old, you're still young.

I saw her cleaning the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard you talking to Tom.
That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to get toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
This hat is no good for me.
What's the minimum wage in South Africa?
It is on a diet because it is slightly overweight.

These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were going out with Tom seriously.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't teach lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's a hard-on.
I think what Tom did was really stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language bearer.
I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend at his beach house.
You're good with black.
You know everything about me.
Let me think about it and I'll get back to you.
They're interesting people.
Please call once in a while.
Tom, check the pockets of your pants.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's all wrong.
I forgot your number.
How many wheat does this field give birth to?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?

That's the right way, your wrong path.
Will you give me a light?
He drinks his coffee every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a machine.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should've worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans cannot solve even their own problems, so how do they even imagine they are capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a tickle.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was so cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were so worried sick.
I think you'll be pleased.
Teenagers have left.
I wish I was rich.
I'm just getting started.
If you need anything, just call me.
Remember, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, and I was wondering if my e-mail had even gotten to you.
She used to comb her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to get his keys with his toes.
His teaching method is both good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a little suitcase.
He witnessed the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that it had nothing to do with this.
I love parties.
That's the camera I bought yesterday.
Short skirts are out of fashion.
I think we're gonna need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
I think so.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he's eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're in my seat.
God forbid!
You're good with green.
I bet you speak French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the coast of the sea.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
As old as you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat down on a dean.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She's convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped at the old house and saw the city once more.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm in a hurry.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, that's too bad!
The bus has arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned his shirt and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good with everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go again at any time.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust the least.
Would you mind waiting outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What prevents you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact drive.
The director considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
Most students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible it's love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom's got two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers in southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that nobody said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everyone jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we're wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than the average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You've got a lot of friends worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I really don't know Tom that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national peculiarities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom threw up blood.
This camera belongs to Tom.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, go ahead, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you leave with my younger sister at the same time?
The sword was delayed for an unknown time.
His brother's learning a lot.
Ken's arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do a lot of people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming from inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is that your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom that he's the opposite.
What's the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I deal with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wronged the address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have an appointment with him at noon.
The invitation said that there would be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's a lot older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a guy you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
You speak French, too?
I recently started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom's got little hands.
He arrived two days early.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a costume.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before we do.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom to the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was checked out of the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
Twin brothers look exactly alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the joke.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I've got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how long I've been learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's celebration.
It's not just you out there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
It was done by hand by Tom.
You won't believe the kind of stuff people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry a lot of luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I haven't told you everything.
They're both working.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given advantage over the others.
I tricked you.
Take him with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me publicly.
The bulb burned.
Tom worked really hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Turn it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the photo I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all thought Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you feel that way.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want; but I'll stop it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think I'll learn to swim during my vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out that easy.
It's almost 5:30.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach there's a really good restaurant I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever sows the winds will reap storms.
According to the latest census, the country's total population is just over 7 million people.
Provisional measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
Think with your head for once.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it for hours.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
This is my sister's picture.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her a piece of advice.
The room was so high, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
Did Spot go too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a hat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in place.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I need to get out for a while.
You're green.
Keep your fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see her?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this store, they do kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works at that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's about to start snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never climbed Mount Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat one live frog every morning, and throughout the rest of the day nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We study French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke's getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
Everyone's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wished he was still single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me my watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I had pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a checkbook.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you around.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In Esperanto, the essentials end up on "o." Multiple numbers are formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Aren't I going to get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It's been a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is Romania's minimum wage?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is a difficult language.
I haven't really eaten.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at his hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Pass it on to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak in English than in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
He's staying a little.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I've got three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I get a chance to return the favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if there was any pens he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't the weather great?
That doesn't make me uncomfortable.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
That's what his ignorance is all about.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is no good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
What club are you in?
Atushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He graduated from Cambridge with honor.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom study French at school?
What kind of shoes do they get?
We definitely tried hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay till tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half of them don't know.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking down the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave up all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
No problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How many cabs do you think come out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastically began his deserving endeavor.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more specific.
I'm on leave this week.
He's washing his socks.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't speak French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
It's my treat.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you mind telling me your name, please?
This type of error is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Does he watch your game?
This is your home.
Losses were hard for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She's making up every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my eyes nice.
I don't have any money.
Millie's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are now demode.
He's doing very well with children.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
It finally stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She's been doing not particularly light hints about what she wants for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where'd you put your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you hand me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he was a chemistry genius.
You can't just go all the way over here and start misbehaving at people's address.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck and couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom's making a lot of effort to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted in vain.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you stupid.
I'm talking French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It was over.
His shirt was dirty with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made Anne a doll.
What'd you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was recently told he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom's studying French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom threw a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished my breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about the people behind their backs.
She's a grown-up.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared doesn't have to worry.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on which the silk beetles live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put me in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's been recovering recently.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in my lab.
Can you give me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend to their illnesses.
I wouldn't think tofu would taste so good.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't had my dizziness yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
My gums are running.
I can't do this alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends, and they'll all understand.
She was cold.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the carnival.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you watching carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the cutest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
There's good food in this restaurant.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment is what they create.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a great poem.
The prices have been down lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the transfer, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to get Tom across the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat by the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a break.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There used to be a lot of frogs in that pond.
I understand that perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry, you won't fix anything.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you that dress.
I heard him come down the stairs.
A friend's coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope this happens.
Perhaps Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why'd you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll love it!
I'm afraid I've hit you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's devoid of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put on these shoes, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like this color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll be studying French next semester.

I'll see you tonight!
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.

Nothing ever happens the way you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should obey their parents.
Are there any errors in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I think of him as my best friend.
No one answered the phone.
I've seen you before.
You're studying Esperanto.
My new bike costs me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it until later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so superficial.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel failed because of the earthquake from the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What have you been doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We made fun of him for that.
John came in a week ago.
He turned down the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The barber is a man who shaves his beards and cuts men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom liked to sing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just an office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be here in time.
He often walks to school.
The socks stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're tough.
How many episodes of "Wan Pace" have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let go of me.
You're sweet, and you're sweet.
My sister lives next door to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
My intention wasn't like that.
I need to get out of here for a second.
She loves the color of her t-shirt.
Hey, man, I'm really asking you to spray some insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your luggage.
Soon after, it started to rain.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
Permissions are not required.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says good-bye and wishes me good-bye.
Let's check it out.
You've done a good job so far.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard to concentrate today.

I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I have work for Tom.
Where'd you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for class.
Let's get this straight. Let's get this straight.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I get a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried it this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this bathroom.
You're on the winning show.
I want something to drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
There's nothing left for her to do but look after the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!

Be careful with her.
Hold your fire.
Isn't that surprising?
He's making friends with everyone he's met.
You need to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand it.

I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was shaking with fear.

Are you registered?

Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.

Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.

I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as much fun as the book.
It wasn't my job.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of what we call the universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our nearest people. Your task should be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I'm familiar with it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?

Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to find out when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.

You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard gunshots.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Who did you translate that for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.

Are you done with your breakfast?
I've got a few old computers.

Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I've got a few calls to make myself.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple took a trip around the world.

Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on your robe.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
It was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.
Why are you here so early?

It'll probably snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.

Sooner or later, his luck will be over.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.

Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom needs to do this now.
I could make you happy.

I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon on the train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you some sushi.
Come on, so much for today.

Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please, give me an envelope.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.

I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look closely at the map on the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.

Give it back!
Say hi to Jimmy for me.
I haven't talked to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you made a mistake.
He didn't mind staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.

Is that our problem?
He gave her a piece of paper.

I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand what's important.
I still haven't figured that out.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The big jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With little goodwill on both sides, our problems should be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She went up the stairs fast.
The house we used to live in is down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the lighthouse, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever congratulated Pfirsichbäumchen in German?
It was an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't it be nice?

Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married and we want to make heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you gonna eat that cookie?
I've been working hard for the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
That might be a little loady.
Looks like our water's about to run out.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green matches Alice.
Our garbage is collected three times a week.
They've trapped the fox.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late because of the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Effort is not only a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's 11 already.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Do you study French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You should use a deodorant.
When I stand up, I feel like you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not taking part in this.
You don't seem too surprised.
That's a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get a sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom practices speaking French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People in general are against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom's never met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You're in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We study French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than listen, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I've got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom is.
Did you make it?
My dad often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't been known to know anything since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
Everyone's hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for your lack of consideration, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like toilets in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is considered.
Tom was saved by a random passerby.
City Hall is downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
It's very kind of you to step out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of town Mary lives in.
Now it's just after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.
The round lasted about five minutes.
He was going around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I have to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, what's left to say.
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the girl's best friends.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangement.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, otherwise you'll regret it.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is completely automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how this works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. How much Japanese food started to like it.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to stress on that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom's teaching me how to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find an account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's big sister.
I don't know either boy.
The guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
How nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruits are rotten under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the control room.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take some time.
I thought you might want to say goodbye.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happy.
He's only four minutes from here by train.
What's he trying to achieve, Tom?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your voice down!
I would never hurt them.
I studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's foggy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he had been away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were intrigued by Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have an infection on your gum.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where were you?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone 20 bucks and never see him again, it's probably worth it.
It's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make that decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You're sitting right where I am.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you study French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of statements about DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Stay out of it.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I've got work to do on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I went home on the train.
I think I can do it on my own time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What kind of situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I find it awkward.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the museum with a taxi.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't date.
It'll be good if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use dental floss.
We arrived quickly because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He's recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in a relationship with him in a long time.
Those goggles are good for you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the catch's over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
That pair of shoes don't fit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so embarrassed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Uigur sentences in Tataba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the assembly.
I'm ashamed I did this.
Let's cross here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Are you going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy humanity.
No, thank you, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't pick him up yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest drawback.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
The rains blow without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
Check, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and release this letter in the meantime.
That chicken hasn't laid a single egg lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Let me finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind that I visited her unexpectedly.
You've got nice lips.
A lot of people are gonna lose their jobs because of the shrinking of the car industry.
He came to my aid.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's about to run out.
The moment of glory for Hanshin did not last long. They were quickly removed from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Isn't that gonna cause any trouble?
He was angry that he was called a fool.
They're getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pushed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I just haven't found it yet.
I need to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the pervaza of the kitchen window to get cold.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me some good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, that's too bad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into a two-ball ball.
It was personal.
Doesn't it interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She had her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you throw them?
Tom, how is he going to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is a picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera belongs to Tom, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me my watch.
Please excuse my delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
You measure that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drove very well.
We have to protect our children.
To new meetings.
I'm totally exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrasse and get off on Zeestrasse.
Laughing is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone told me about.
Add this website to "Preferred".
When the sun of culture is low, even dwarfs cast a great shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I'm not going to give in to threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's doing fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to submit the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He disobeyed my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone bake a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she available tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
We almost didn't have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as a Frenchman.
I think we need to make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really pretty busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little carried away while I was dancing, and I went up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom could smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking on the unequal road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind, you.
She took her exam.
I'll study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the exam.
This book isn't Tom's property.
Where have you been?
I've got to get him out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's already a grown man.
Let's not fool ourselves.
I'm better.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
You ever heard of him?
She washed her shirt fast.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Tom really wants to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you wore different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read in French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter file.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape, riding a bike.
This isn't the end of history yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just shake your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French scriptures?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move in with you.
She's twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What could that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That honor is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's on the run.
They long for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between 8:00 and 10:00.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running around with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discussing it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw away those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was obsessed with a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say things like that.
He came after you left.
Have you had breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's on his way to first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me this before.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you that dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom hardly understands anything from French.
It's the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is wasting a lot of power.
Don't commit to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made the man, and then he made the woman, and then he took pity on the man, and gave him the tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eyes.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That's not gonna change anything.
The building's almost done.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Oh, he's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from a flat rate.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticity, I consider myself an exception.
The storm wouldn't stop, but it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the way they were.
Show me.
Tom had his tooth removed last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't cover up how that makes you feel.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't go into the lock.
What is the minimum salary in Italy?
Tom turned on the lamp again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my dad found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got really mad.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with such bad gums, she hardly even has IMA teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try the dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself, jumping off a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They're headed straight for their goal.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
Check, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
The continuity is paid off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking around in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a pencil.
Don't rush me.
I think you should grow a beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soft drink?
Many people share my view of the matter.
The shirt is clean.
Some tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great endeavor at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be lit.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French a lot smoother than I do.
I'm gonna hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He played while he was walking.
I saw the girl in the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English. I can't speak German. I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way of saving you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter out of milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean that.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hacone.
Look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom, start the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Cook 300 grams of rice.
Is that not enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather kept us from going.
I'm learning French now.
Since I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm awfully busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on the winning show.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The spread of television has deprived us of our time to read.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't peek at me in my closet.
The new Coronavirus is highly contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here off the record.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here till 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me so much.
It's forbidden to smoke in the school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people can speak well and others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom's on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I should never have let you do this alone.
Convicted of death.
I've only waited five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsh" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom had his knees cut.
I'll come with you back to the hotel.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40.
Do you have your driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is coming back again.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported a police disaster.
I can't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's not here.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas regarding your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What exactly is this about?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to do it.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
It's not as bad a disease as the laziness.
Aren't you afraid, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He sometimes watches TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the race.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Coming here was a mistake.
Don't bother us so much.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That doesn't make Tom understand anything.
Don't forget to bring kitchenware like knives and cooking vessels.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think so.
I lost track of time.
He thought it might be a trick.
Baso is the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anybody.
Tom's got his knee peeled.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponed the celebration.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They've got five butterflies.
You did it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Put the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
I saw his father arguing with him.
Keep your room clean and handy.
I had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I studied his face for the scars of exhaustion.
Music is the common language of humanity.
Give me some sugar.
I'll drive you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be my pleasure to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He often goes to the movies with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was over.
I'll be there for you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston you were staying at last year?
It's a complex problem.
It's 10:00 p.m. now.
It's raining like a bucket.
Are you a bachelor, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We won't be here in 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like to play sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to find out.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest innovations in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing that.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it off as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to get a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't have done this.
You're a good singer.
Cat eats.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention.
Speaking of trips, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educated his children well.
I was just being polite.
Tom raises tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks like a shy young man.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm sick of sleeping.
Be more specific.
I was on leave.
No one will know.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his seat belt on.
Do you think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Did you owe it already?
Will you teach me how to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
There's something I need to tell you first.
A cup of coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have any other choice?
He's alone.
In China we put the first family first, then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't bother them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has a drinking problem?
Will there be someone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard from him in a few months.
I don't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
I kind of understand that question.
Why aren't you here?
Tom's the guy who gave me that bike.
We will not fire under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom's a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you weigh that?
What's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
That's not what I said.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?
I'm not very good at speaking French.
Ask him about the road to the station.
Bill went fishing during the day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works at the winery.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
She makes me feel uncomfortable.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
Steffides are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of possibilities.
We used to drive when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't so bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of the terrible scream made him shake.
Do you have that shirt in black?
It wasn't a celebration.
Amy ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took things off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no need to worry.
We've got a physical.
Did you have fun yesterday?
That sweater costs over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their names.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the shop.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they get dirty.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I'm on Highway 58.
I think Tom's scared of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Open your shirt, please.
I almost forgot.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary fought seriously.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We went on a race in Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You've been drinking since my class.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's work going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone's a comfort.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I was barely dealing with the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But a ball of ball, a Turkish panic, Ody Vancho, our captain.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom's planning on enrolling in.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lot of big lotus leaves.
We firmly believe that when drawing up sentences, the author must avoid giving in to harmful habits that are inherent in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely unnecessary in the light of the purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move," made your way and sat down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
I feel bad every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what could happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm nothing king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilos of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that near your house?
Jane filled out one of the applicants.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You shouldn't say things like that when there's kids around.
It's easy to catch cold.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'm gonna study Tom.
The train is ten minutes late today.
There's been a silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little bit of French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an examination on the date of the exam.
Maybe he's avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, practically every family has a laundry.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I had a lot of heads.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
He always said hello with a gift.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's okay, right?
She looked at herself for a while in the paper.
JF Kennedy was buried in Arlington Cemetery.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work hard.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very hot lately. My favorite football team is west.
It was easy for me to relate to the sweet talk.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's still light.
Tom got hurt.
His room is a mess.
They spend part of their free time taking care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's planning on going.
Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We postponed the departure until tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have had to come.
You'd better put your sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Add this website to "Preferred".
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what's bothering you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain, and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't home last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy that skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French.
Are you coming?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They built the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been taking my days to French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
It's him, or I'm wrong.
You study French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing all the time.
I play in a group.
The birds were singing.
Tom finishes work at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
There will come a time when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get to the museum by bus?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be specific.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: where the gold is, he sets the rules.
The house is haunted.
Tom's going into town.
Everything that isn't forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't give a shit.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty good.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not receive basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give a part of the work of the junior staff.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do that.
Whatever you're doing, you can't let a man believe in something, much less himself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioning isn't working.
You're sitting in my seat.
Is something scaring you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to study French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid $200 in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up this watch for a little while, and not at all talking about breaking up with him.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a while longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
I bathe every morning in the summer.
Cuff your shirt.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits to oranges.
This place is worth a visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed her blouse.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I took your book until I left it, I was always laughing, and one day I thought I'd start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
Fighter's on the round.
That's what I've seen.
The dolphin is kind of a pansy.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be dragged in.
I don't do drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
Tooth calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British children are needed at school, not less than pencil and tire.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
He'll give you all the information he needs.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm borrowing money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold time when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a chicken with no head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He put his coat on and left the house.
Dadeba's new website will run a domestic hyper database, built by a search engine, and it will go to a tadebux-OS server with a dade-bucket CPU made entirely of tadeby.
Her old man got in the way.
She hated being called a coward.
I love it.
I never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During my vacation, I read all of Milton's work.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked a question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
What's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll drive you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden are dying.
They made us work all day.
We chose him president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predetermined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
This species is endangered.
I think you'd better lie down.
I like you very much.
I rang the bell.
The wolves are moving on a pack.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it in.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved significantly according to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We've finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you make it a little more clear?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we should look into things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna make a great father.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at 9:00?
Let's synchronise our clocks.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a free shop?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I had told you, Kel fide.
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
He looks like a man from a distance.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not be hasty.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make hasty conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he gets into his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I went home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
I'm sorry!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you'd like to order?
I saw the boy go to sleep.
She called it what it was.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
Kids thought their parents were made of money.
The spits were numbed by the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Children are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be so stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep going.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish that Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll be able to make it in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodyguard.
The man eats bread.
He's swimming the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone indirectly sends a message in a bottle, it's just a childhood fantasy, when Christopher Columbus sends a message in a bottle, the fate of a whole country is staked out on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so many problems.
Kids play dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to act human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and Muiril's birthday.
The way he works shows nothing to boast about.
We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.
She kind of pushed the door.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in barbershop.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
Then I visited the museum for the first time.
Is she staying at a hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?
He's an atheist.
I thought you might be mad at me.
I surrender.
I know her very well.
What's in the beach bag that's in your car trunk?
I don't trust women.
He's an atheist.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Don't leave, Tom.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I don't care if that's true.
I don't blame anyone.
I'll never forget your kindness.
There's no toilet paper.
You're sitting in my seat.
I don't speak French as well as Tom.
She got good English grades.
What do you want?
