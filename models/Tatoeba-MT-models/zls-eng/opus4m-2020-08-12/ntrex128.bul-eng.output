The members of the Wells Assembly worry that "they look like muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are amazed at their proposal to change the title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wells.
Members of the entire political spectrum worry that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourists said that his group was worried that the new name was "rhyming with Tub and Udulb."
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh, this certainly has an offensive meaning.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the entire group is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party has indicated that his group is "not preconvinced" to change the name, but notes that the new name OHR (in English – MWP) has a certain verbal occasion with a "mupet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is similar to the English Yorkshire Pronunciation of U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves.”
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals establishing broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the Wells Parliament.
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Wells Parliament", in short, "CHR", but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support since the inquiry into society.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching a consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft draft draft on the change within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the committee system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
Sunday's voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area with the name "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greece's state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the state, said he would not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's vans are silenced in the background of church difficulties in Harlem
"If we look at a historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and church literally on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today they're both gone."
Adams says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he added.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhoods of everyday life, where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments, where people who do not help survive the other shrines of the neighborhood live.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built by white traps before Harlem became a neighborhood of blacks – the Metropolis Community in 1870 and St. Martin's decades later.
The original white methodist congregation was carried out in the years after 1930.
Then the building became owned by the black residents of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was poetized by black Christians under the guidance of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organised a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage to the fire, but Father Johnson's enorias made a plan for her restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly calls them "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world to be used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the largest system in the church Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweather mentions that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the last few weeks has been a complex story drawn up by architects and performers, some brought by the world's leaders of the church and others by the bishop's diocese.
From the press – which is the leading body of the congregation, consisting of world leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concerns that the diocese "would be inclined to transfer the costs of the newspaper", although it did not play a role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A 13-year-old kid was injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California.
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representative authorities reported.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was snorkeling with friends about half an hour a Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went along with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then realized he was screaming, "I'm getting bit!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his clavicle had been torn apart.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark!" Hamel adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was accepted in critical condition.
It's still unknown what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Gilles, said in a media briefing that a few weeks earlier, a shark was spotted in the water, but it was estimated that it was not of a dangerous species.
Jills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
From the responsible authorities have closed access to the coastal line from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours of safety considerations as the investigation progresses.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans offensive on the UK market for adornment products
Sainsbury faces Boots, SuperOthers and Debenhams by opening booths for adornment products in their facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK market for adornable products, which is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, the largest so far beauty stands will be located in 11 stores throughout the country, after which, in the success of the initiative, similar ones will be found in more sites.
The investment turn in the adornment industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the racks, until recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of products offered up to 3000 products by first including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space similar to the proposals in Boots stores.
The supermarket also releases its butic gamma makeup again, so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly wanted by younger users.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will test discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London last week, while the second one will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on buying smaller quantities of food daily at comfortable times leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury, said that the facilities would look more and more like universal shops, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have Argos sites in hundreds of shops, as well as open sites of clusters, since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims increased the sales of food and made the profits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to prefacilitate its beauty and pharmaceutical facilities was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute to distribute profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in the special training of our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on-the-spot.
The range of brands offered by us aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a seductive environment with a convenient location, making us an attractive destination for beautiful products, which challenges the concept itself in the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby's resignation from the 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons star Den Peter Jones "berefted" after television host Holly Willoughby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds with his Lifestail company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of home appliances and accessories of Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Ginette Poltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old leader announced her departure to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to statue" after withdrawing from their income business with the brand of lifestyle products in the last minute – and focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones “began to get angry” when the TV’s “gold girl” admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his Marlow business empire headquarters, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean there will be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop brand of Ginette Poltrow, with rumours that it doubled Willoughby's wealth, whose value is predicted at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced in Instagram his departure to Truly, Jones left Britain on a plane to head to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be its long-term commitment to ensure its future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the cooks absolutely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlow headquarters that's full of waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of this morning, which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a slowdown in the placing of the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who mothered her to three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, like Jones, who is 52 years old, joined as president of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the MEP of the M&S brand and will also replace Ann McParlin as the leader of the I'm Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs. ”
Heavy negotiations leading to a "stopping of relations"
He joked about the criticism he would bear from the news channels for making comments that someone would consider "unsuitable for the president" and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump replied in his jesting "journalistic" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in a second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a major step towards removing North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are in stasis.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea diplomat Ri Jung Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal attitude" by the United States towards its country's first steps along the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results - the termination of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of US military bodies.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd to themselves.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok of foreign NGOs, it was said there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal opinion that does not require international assistance, which makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" consists of a team headed for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokeswoman of the disaster agency Mr Sutopo announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains so unprepared for this type of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in the case of tsunamis in Atcheh, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands poses a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate even more this logistics.
Until recently stationed in Lombok for the service of earthquake victims, a hospital ship was headed to Palu, but it would be at least three days before he could reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joco Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's lagging infrastructure into the centre of his campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.
But the lack of finance is constantly harassing his cabinet, while Jocco is back on the urns next year.
Mr Joco is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets with kittens, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Look: Daniel Sterridge brings a late equalization for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing the High League against Chelsea with a goal in 89 minutes this Saturday at Stafford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a pass from Gerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He set the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and headed for the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the plagiarized Kepa Arisabaga and entwined insecurely into the network.
"I made sure to take a good position in mastering the ball because players like Shak are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I just tried to get as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Stirage told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the asking Cante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without thinking too much."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star, Edna Azar.
The attacker of the "sons" submitted his fifth to Mateo Kovacic, after which he sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovačitch exchanged a quick double pass at the center.
Then he put out a fast-shooting belt with which he took Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar outruns the defenders and marks with his left foot in the far corner by the doorman of Liverpool Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the group stage of the Champions League at 3:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is increasing to 832
The number of people killed after the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a magnetod 7.5, which defeated the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet high, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported.
The town of Palu, with over 380 000 people, is infested with ruins from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man 32 years old on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched since the body of a woman was found at the Berkenhead this morning.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the stabbing of Grayson Meuse on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for cooperation from everyone in the area who's seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I ask all those close to John Street in Berkenhead to see or hear something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers who may have recorded something with the cameras on their board, to contact us, as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Berkenhead and was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman their acquaintance arrived at the scene and questioned where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that it is now informing the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Meows tried to get home to his apartment, but was notified by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he found out about what happened.
The residents have been informed that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
It continues to repeat “this is so terrible. ”
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the cordon while another van remained outside.
There are police officers in the cordon who are watching the apartment block.
All available information are asked to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30th.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue turns into the latest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its ban will be a poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "freak" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell made to the Palace of Westminster to become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is proof of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case this is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person, which represents one side of the resulting division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be marked and celebrated."
A pig-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern China market, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near the rim of the Liupanchui market in Guajzhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines in 30 May 2005 in Sinin of the Province of Zurich, China.
He is supposed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door open next door.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the hen with a bloody mirage.
Judicial expertise has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's move was bloodied and disfigured," says Cousin Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that the Yuan family and market management are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Even though they're rare, there's been reports of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked her wife and husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife was able to chase him away.
After an oregan farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “punch”.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not intended to hurt anyone.
But one must treat them with respect," the man ends.
The losing hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and spilling rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as she moves over the cold waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will lead to flood rains in North Mexico and southwest parts of the United States.
The rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane of category 1, considered at 5 a.m. Eastern time and is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, there's beginning to be a single cell that's moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Bahamas on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she'll start pushing tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching single will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At a local level of 1 to 4 inches rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carried debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be lightning floods under rapidly exacerbating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel a foot in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and flood winds.
The approaching Sinclair will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to get to precipitation from over half an inch, which will lead to low-grade waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most Central and Eastern US are expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the seductive performance of the Supreme Court nomination Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During that time, political opposition continued, with networks breaking their regular turnaround programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement agreed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was convinced 100% that Kavanaugh was pushing herself drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionally devoid testimony, is absolutely sure that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely even more than the number of 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen to watch the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the averagers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate data available on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also traditionally experiencing difficulties by measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
To compare, we are talking about an audience similar to the size of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, is the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full day hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2,52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office came out with a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded him playing protest Friday while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here, standing before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already come out with a declaration before the elevator doors closed, saying it would be further decided during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided live coverage several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Ala Flake announced that he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, which the opposition Democrats insist on.
Flake was partly convinced of his conversation with his friend, the senator from the Democratic Party, Chris Kwons.
After talking to Queens and a few senators, Fleck made a decision.
Its choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" with Brekzit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and in undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of UK customs fees to the EU and vice versa is "completely absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the final fatal shooting of Wade Simms, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, the police department in Baton Rouge reported.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
Its guarantee was set at $350,000, notified by the Advocate.
East Baton Rouge's Justice Office published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The government expressed their gratitude to the fugitives of the Louisiana state police, police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents for the assistance they have contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletic sports director Jo Aleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
Six feet tall and six inches a player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Waynes, also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average in the last season he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "serve" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that worries a person all the time. ”
Vulcan spreads ashes over Mexico City
The volcanoes of Pocatepetel’s ashes reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National disaster prevention centre warned Mexican citizens Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity has increased and 183 gas and ash discharges have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center's been monitoring multiple tremors and tremors.
Published in social media photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City neighborhoods, for example in Hokmilko.
Geophysics reported an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since the earthquake with the magnetodoo 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after independent protesters clashed with the gendarmes when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the separation of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmes, began to resent the guardians of peace with eggs and powdered paint, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, other contacts were made with the police, and the police resorted to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups were screaming "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while the country's integrity was being declared "Spanish forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence of the region even a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Separatist Catholics.
The vast majority voted in favour of independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the region's voting departments with a number of clashes.
The demanding independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hopes for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a stalemate," the man added.
Despite the significant victory, whether by a small difference, in the regional elections in the last December, the supporters of Catalonia's political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed captivity or are arrested in anticipation of a process due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it is getting more tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year's elections.
He argues that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to counter the repression of democratic values and the repressions we observe by the Spanish government".
Londonders: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 respectively were arrested after a car crashed several times into a house in Londonderi.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings announced that there was damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible the car was shot with an arbat.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The New Yorker in the Livingston High League surprised the Rangers and only caused a second loss to Stephen Gerard in his first 18 games as a club manager at the Ibroks.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team leveled on points two in the Hiburnian ranking.
Gerard's team is left without winning a foreign field in the High League this season, and next Sunday it faces the leader Harts, who is eight points behind in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers is hosting Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of loss since he changed Kenny Miller's position last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the no-show guests
Holt's team had to lead the score far before it scored a goal, and his direct style of playing extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his blow went sideways, then Alan Litgow shot past the beam after Craig Halkett put the ball back on his head.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for the guests from static situations.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingstone played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and took Menga out, who took his ball and marked from the middle of the criminal field.
So far, Rangers have ruled the ball more, but they've faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's leg, and a hit with Littlelow's head passed by the door after another static position for Livingstone.
In Livingston's criminal field, however, centrifuges were rolling, which were easily cleaned, and the judge twice failed to respect the claims of the guests for a double – first after the unison between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve and then in doubt about playing with his hand.
"Fenmental" from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and a great score for Livingstone.
The team is playing just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not have any changes after the return of the team to the High League, but Holt deserved much commendation for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing his defenses in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under a lot of pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers have shown nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's guidance they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were much below these standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, with only once managed to split the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives mixed admission to Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down because of problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's admission into the EU.
Then Erdogan headed for Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but yet many supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom have also raised their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect the breakdown caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is also despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: Cycling rests after a car crash
A cyclist died after a car crash in London.
The disaster occurred near the block of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of town, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical attention arrived, but the rider died in place.
The accident took place several months after another rider died after being hit by an escaped driver on Childers Street, about a mile away from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Capital Police have announced that their employees are working on identifying the man, and will then inform his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are shifted, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in a riot
Six prison supervisors were injured in a high-security male prison, according to the Prison Office.
Matthews exploded at Long Lartin Prison in Worchester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
For the purpose of mastering it, special staff members of the Tordano task force are called upon to deal with eight people deprived of liberty, with the confusion itself being limited to a prison wing.
The injured supervisors suffered minor injuries to the individuals and received medical attention on site.
A spokesman for the Prison Office made the following statement: “Specially trained officials have been summoned to deal with the incident at Long Lantin Prison.
Six supervisors received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and that their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that following an attack by a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October of last year, police officers from the anti-deterioration units were called to prison, where they could control a heavy storm where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but it is very likely that this will happen early next week, while the losing hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert of the southwest, leading with her the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established positions against lightning floods Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, with late Monday bringing rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre provide for 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain on each site.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rose may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest part is currently in drought.
According to the Commission for the Monitoring of Dry Periods of the United States, a little over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second by weight category", reports Weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to the reach of the drought at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
The rose, which can still boast on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific, and therefore it weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of afternoons.
“Account rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible,” reports Weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning floods and bring different waste streams into the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsamer Norton assault: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is placed in a hospital where its condition remains "stable".
During the night in the Radstock area, a boy was arrested at 17, two boys at 18 and a 20-year-old man reported by police in Avon and Somerset.
The cops are asking everyone who may have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the debauchery and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that rejects the devious and offensive tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh had been "suffered by the indignation and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejected Christine Blaise Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "Today the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence, courage and qualities".
"Every vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president told the crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly reflected Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks until one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, I am also involved," Trump continued.
"This is why I am going around and I am fighting to support good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats had set themselves up as a mission to "prevent and prevent".
The first key Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to CNN, one of the senior representatives of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, victims increase
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were carried away by the swept coast by giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at night the coast was swept by waves of up to six meters (18 feet), carried many to their deaths and destroyed everything along their path.
The tsunami struck after an earthquake with a 7.5-magned magnetode.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, which is why many have become victims of the disaster," said during a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokeswoman of the Indonesian BNPB disaster control agency.
"The water had pulled cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything along its path," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the disaster agency photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
The second earthquakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) came out with a declaration that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be higher along the coast 300km (190km) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is nearer to the center of the cane.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, in turn, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already headed for the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticised for not informing the defeated Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Shared in social networks, lovers' videos show a man on the upper floor of a building who screams at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the coast and takes both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in due time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe power outage, which has stopped communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other first-needed products.
The city airport was opened again only for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palli on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in brezento shelters crucified in the courtyard of their office, they passed through a number of scenes of desolation, says Mr. Dozeba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite working on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some complain that the experience experienced in such situations by foreign rescue workers is hampered by reaching Palu.
Under the Indonesian regulations, funding, staffing and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such status."
While over Palu falls the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paraplannerism team, trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roe-Roe Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the field of paraplannerism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the crash of the hotel "Roe-Roe" reached the community of paraplannerism, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves raise 26 750 dollars during the charge of an ATM in Newport to Levy
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26 750 from a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport to Levy, it became clear from a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the pleasure complex and was preparing to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “produced running behind Brink’s employee’s back ” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, continued the message, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
All those with information on the identity of the suspects must contact the NYPD on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye · Global Voices
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man, officially known as Kanye West, ”
West, 41, has been carrying the nickname Ye for some time and used it as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change exceeded his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the creator of the show told us.
Except that it is an acronym of his current professional name, West, and before he claimed that the word had religious importance to him.
"I believe that "he" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you" or "you," said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
“This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
Changed from Kanye, which means only one person, to Ye – which reflects the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of the many known in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences for the aliases Leo and Brader Love.
One of West’s previous associates, J. Z, was also presented in either option with or without indents and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force. This happened as the country approached the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelko Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador took an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the financing of the development of I.I.
At a time when China becomes increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States must double its research budget in this area, argues researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various US government units made statements on the II topic, although the United States as a whole does not have an official II strategy.
During this time China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 of innovations in II by 2030.
"The duplication of the II development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs with regard to II," Lee said.
Double funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the II area coming from the United States, as Lee informed CBS in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Supersitives of I.I.: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest I.I. companies in China – Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellen Lee University worked on an I.I. system that beat the most successful hijacker in America, then was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee owes the debt to the previous technology competitions of the federal government, for example the robotics competition of the Agency for Advanced Research Projects on Defence, and asks when will be the next one to help identify the new visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government funding," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders, it's the corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented university lights to work on I.I.
Lee further claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its II programme.
"I think doctors in I.I. sciences should be automatically offered green cards," the man said.
The United States State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee clarifies.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than 100 million dollars a year in developing II.
Meanwhile, the US legislative body, which wanted to set up a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security, has not marked any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
Citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area with the name Macedonia, argues its northern neighbour's name is claims against its territorial integrity, thus imposing a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he himself will not vote in the referendum, while a boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubt whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The ballot issue reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formed after the break-up of the Yugoslav country of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old Skopje citizen.
Although the referendum does not have a binding force, enough members of parliament have ruled that they will comply with the result of it to such a degree that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote for it.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities reports by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene for 54 years and arranged chairs in front of the tents, resisted by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us because more than 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his own voice.
The statesman also said the positive result would lead to "confirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results from a survey, according to which between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the necessary activity.
Another study, a case by Macedonian TV Telma, announced that 57% of the responders plan to vote Sunday.
Of them 70% said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-West government policy since it won power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defenses and marks a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defence and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory to Manchester City on Saturday in Manchester, England.
The game of Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine Gol Master was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outruns three Brighton defenders before he sprints the ball into the empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of Brighton's defenders, then left behind the rest of them on the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he filed left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right foot hit over Brighton Matthew Ryan's doorman and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his legs," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned for him to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal right now."
But Sterling was the one who provided the original advance of “the heavens ” in this match of the High League of England.
He signed off on the 29th minute.
In the naked Aguero situation, he was given a deep pass in half of Brighton.
He immediately released a dog on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The attacker of the “heavens ” was able to detect nearer, shortly before the ball came out.
The city will face Hofenheim in a match from the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Cherzer wants to play the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no special meaning for another match of the official starting pitcher.
Yet always the ambitious Sherzer hopes to be the titler Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant to the Rockies who lead with one match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed at least a "wild card" game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we are not fighting for nothing ourselves, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it is thought that they will allow Sherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer, this would be the 34th match as a starting pitcher this year, as he held training Thursday and would have the normal time to rest until Sunday.
The right-hand pitcher on Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikers in 220 2/3 of this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president hinted at the situation with his constituent for Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, I am also really involved, that is why I am fighting all the forces for the right candidates," Trump said.
Afterwards, he continued with “All you see this terrible, horrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to restore power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses of their unhappiness, of their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to get involved in power and government because they're only interested in power and governance, but we won't give them any."
The Democrats, according to the president, have set out to "prevent and hinder".
"What we have all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "angry, nasty, sneaky and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate Judicial Commission, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Finestein by name, which caused strong whistles from the crowd.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
What?
No, no, I waited – it was really bad ugliness – perhaps the worst I've ever seen.”
Labers aren't wide-ranging anymore.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of parliament from the Labourists to whom it has been declared that he is not welcome - just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received this attitude because he was determined to face anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that "we want meetings to include everyone and be beneficial".
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labourists in parliament, Friday's meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises of a "lighter and measured" policy has long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became more and more obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was assessed on the basis of how much it liked the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I used to think shared similar political views began to expect me to make a reverse turn and to take positions I would never agree with - either in national security or in the EU's single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there is a whole defamation of the social media, where it is called for response, rejection of moderate policy, applications that it does not belong to the Labourists.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I have even had better luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are at least mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues who face sexist or racist bribes every day without fearing them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labourists should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with any sign of mistrust or change of the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have received many counsels to keep quiet, not to speak so much, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thatcher government, which, through neglect, led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local consultant or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards Brexit, this will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labourists.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labourists, or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats from responding or political dissociation will refuse to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led to the ranking
The two late essays may have changed the final score, but there's no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's High League.
The team is now in charge of ranking and the only team in the ten teams is without loss until now.
Better defence and better use of opportunities have proved decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because other teams have tested us quite seriously in past matches, and we are still without loss," Merci noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Air really took advantage of their positions better than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frazier Klimo, performed Air ahead in the result, but yellow card for Scotland's national Rory Hughes, released to play in the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up on the result after Jason Baggot realized an essay followed by a failed additional blow.
Air conditioning increased the head start for Air from a penalty strike just before the halftime, marking the essay after the solo action, and then realizing the additional blow that made the result of 17-5 for Air on vacation.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to the Bag, reduced the lead to only five points.
The result is a long-term suspension of the game due to a severe injury from Ruardid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and after the renewal of the Eyre game increased their advance after Stafford McDowell's essay and a successful additional blow to the air conditioning.
Then Air Blair McPherson's acting captain got a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of their numbered advantage by putting heavy pressure on the essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained their presence and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card after taking down Klima without a ball, from the subsequent criminal act McPherson carried out an essay with the help of Air's advanced offensive line.
Klimo realizes the extra blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the ball kicked out of David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the flag for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The Star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to have turned to a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular broadcast, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming season nine would be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Krajglang.
According to official registers, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan had intended to join Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: the lack of access to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the vessel will reopen the road to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are constantly patrolling the oculars with a seaboard in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are surrounded by the motto: “The sea belongs to us according to law.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit passed on to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has been the strongest for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting judgment from the international court on October 1st, after five years have already been considered.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is clearness and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court's verdict on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's demand and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivian sovereign access to the ocean.
Here's Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to head to the disputed re-election battle next year, has also been betting a lot on Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of a court ruling for Bolivia's benefit is quite low, and even if it judges in its favor, it wouldn't change things in reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to take the territory of Chile and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments states that the case is “not complex”, retaliated by Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been dissipated by the current government of Bolivia," Zarate argues.
After that, he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric had deprived and that little remained the goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to normal dialogue.
Both countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile" as well as a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by reaching both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales - who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political duck".
"The sick will never give up his right to go out to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ree presented her speech Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises it made during a meeting between opposition leaders in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting the unprecedented diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
He called it "empty hope" the idea that continuing the sanctions and objections of the United States for a declaration that would end the Korean war would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without the authorities first making a significant gesture along the way of disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that the authorities are serious about their refusal of arsenal, in which they view it as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit the company next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest scream on massive hats, which will soon be in fashion stores next to you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sunbeams, you do not need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which rocked the fashion floor during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Quite the impractical hats I caused a wave in Instagram during the summer, with designers sending their eyes-wrestling creatures to crush the fashion community.
Valentino’s contortional proposal was an extravagant beige hat with like feathers a wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of models.
The other too large accessories included jeweled dunes, a magical hat and even pineapple – but they are not meant to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colour masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of the higher fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like melted fungi ice cream.
If you're into such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after “La bomb” – the straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult to the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the wearer wearing a swimsuit.
The strip bag with the color of a burnt orange, with slices of lyphie and nicked with a white leather handle, was the attractive all-seeing item in La Riviera SS19's Jacquemus collection during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity Stilist Luke Armid told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for wholesale accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS, aim to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their careers, and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in an understandable language about him, your words will be able to reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first and foremost with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages achieved high A.
Data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with 72% of German students, 69% of French schools and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
At present, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Labour Skills Commission in 2014 showed that for the reasons that employers are having difficulty finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Thus, more and more the rule of foreign languages becomes mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which turns these skills into essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after having a similar skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages one breast in front of the competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013 75% did not rule a foreign language well enough to carry out language, and French was the only language whose rule reached a two-digit percentage with an indicator of 15%.
That is why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Governing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from teaching languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in the future towards 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered “International communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.

LeBron will make his debut on Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting is almost over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first match with Los Angeles Lakers' team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first match of the pre-season preparations against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it's still unclear how many minutes he'll play in the fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said Walton's joke through Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced in Tweeter that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week James was asked about his plans for the six matches from Lakers' pre-season preparation.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rally tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned rallys, which include stops in familiar places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the affirmative vote for its choice to fill the posts in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened by the loss of control over Congress in the November vote.
What time will Trump's rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wiling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider hearings this week on Supreme Court nominations for Brett Cavanaugh, which have raised tension over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which retains the Senate's affirmative vote until one week while an investigation is under way by the FBI.
However, the main goal of this series of rallys is to help Republicans raise momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that the five rallys in next week aim to "activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important to its programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters told a campaign spokesman who refuses to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit to West Virginia will take place – the state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisy, who is lagging behind in the sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Drag 2018: The US team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue "foursom" matches on Sunday afternoon, they may have brought what Ryder Shower needed.
Changing the advantage of sports is quite a subjective concept, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in races like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led by six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we've picked up a little momentum," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points in just twelve more for distribution.
As Spit says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans shouldn't lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Speight and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speight shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The promotional announcements of fans grew stronger as he progressed in a round in which with a precise blow he leveled the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas were two lags behind the first two holes.
His blow, which won the game at the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spite says.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesco Molinars and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable heroes of Ryder Drago so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four, and it looks like everything's working out for them.
Molliwood was the only couple who did not make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also did not have "gods" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These consecutive successes, as well as the way in which it seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, have confirmed the opinion that they are players who will win Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinars, which will bring the potential victory of Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the stories of European fame proved a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "fourball" matches from the morning, while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "dubles" on the first nine holes put the Spanish and Swedish into problems they failed to deal with.
But in Sunday matches, there's no way anyone else can solve your problems.
The "Fourball" and "foursom" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teamly and therefore gained considerable advantage before the last day, but this session of "foursom" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the US, were deeply doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Drag.
Europe will have a solid head start before the last day of Ryder Drag, after taking the United States 10-6 after the match of the "fourball" and "foursom" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two wins against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, with which their share of the Le Golf National competition rose to four points.
In an attempt to win back the trophy that lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourball" matches against the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the 3-1 win.
The United States has shown more resistance in "foursom" matches, where they won two wins, but have failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs 8 points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was Europe's first recruit to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known for the name "Moliwood", became only the second couple to win four points of their first four matches in Ryder's dear history.
After they unspeakably outplayed Woods and Patrick Reed in the "fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambou with an even more categorical score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two matches on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated flashes of genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in "fourball" and "foursom" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning's "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursom" clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
The team of Europe, however, failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cold and unsavoury day from Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas restored the American hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a tough victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory Macylroy with 4&3 in "foursom" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Drago has a team come to catch up with four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team will keep the trophy even at equality.
After they were outplayed in two consecutive days, however, their chances of a turn-off Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is “no way ” to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepen US mistrust and there is no way the country will give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong-hou said that in the last year, "significant measures of goodwill" were taken, for example, to stop nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances can we first disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ree was expressing North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step" approach to removing nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, since it had taken phased measures, his statement seemed significant since he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as he did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement from Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump provided guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States says that it must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for the relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insist "first to remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war", Rei said.
"The understanding that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is the meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-In over the past five months and added: "If the country had reached such a stalemate on nuclear disarmament, not the United States, the removal of the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear weapons would not have reached such a stalemate.
However, the tone of Ree's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he said at the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "a man rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened North Korea with "full destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain in place while North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council must reward the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must certainly continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the nuclear programme and the Ballistic Rocket Programme.
Pompeo met with Ree at the towers of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Croatia again next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Libya in July with words that progress had been made, but only after a few hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he seeks are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night” with the help of caffeine.
A teacher found that students at the number one university in the world often don't even think about it when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared the course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said no one has ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to students the most essential thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after students were found to suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
In another part of the participants, it is said how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke," added Professor Kaisler.
The culture of pride from "Learning all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensure sufficient and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete such a curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaisler recommends that students consider whether to set the alarm for sleep and awakening and to know the harmful effects of “blue light” emitting from the electronic screens and the LED light that can upset the circus rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Goal crushes Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's useless team and won 1-0 for Livingston.
The Ibrocks team wanted to record its first victory as a guest of triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only struck Gerard's second defeat in his 18th game as manager, leaving his team with eight points less than Harts's torn-off team, leader of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga marked seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas by the Rangers team at no time seemed close to evening.
After the Rangers game, they went down in sixth place, and Livingston is already third, lagging behind from the second Hibernian only in the naked difference.
For Rangers, there may also be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was obviously thrown away by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that broke Air into the semifinals of the Scots League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same 11-year-old Livingstone who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team mated all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They had to mark it in the second minute when Menga took one touch to Scott Pittman against the doorman Alan McGregor, but the half-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs's centerage from foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow turned the ball away from the rear beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a double in the 15th minute when he ran into Steven Lawles, but Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian claim.
Rangers made only two precise hits during the first half, but the former doorman from Ibrox Liam Kelly dealt easily with the head blow of Lasana Culibali and the weak shot of these Edgerias.
Although Livy's 34-minute attack was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was fully earned.
Rangers failed again to deal with Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the break by changing Culibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing handed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play in a comfortable game - style for the hosts, with Litgow and Halkett constantly dropping off the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' blow, and with the next corner, Litgow shot his head by the beam.
The intruder, like Glenn Middleton's reserve from Rangers, asked for a double at the end of the fight after working with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't see anything wrong with the situation again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the gamer counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day that future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger is developing a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, invention, which ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a gamer counter.
Since then, the gamer's counter has also turned into a cornerstone of pop culture, when the film "The Kambanis of Coronado" was released in 1950, which apparently included the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a gamer counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium..
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure they're shooting right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them into a laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are injected again in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine who teaches the immune system to identify other people's cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then inject again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the National Oncology Institute of the United States of America in Betezda, Maryland: “The results suggest we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several types of cancers’, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and ‘training’ them to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again" in his participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was played at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after doing a meaningless performance that praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again", he declared against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"I talk to white a lot and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Commission for Appeals for Sexual Violence, made by Christine Blaze Ford.
Although not aired, the record of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained in front of the auditorium that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been harassed!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship?”, claiming that it will wear Superman’s suit because it means that you cannot tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
The comments caused at least twice the whistles from the audience and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety said, one of them said, "The whole studio was silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzles many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a "Perrier" bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANKS YOU IF THE COMMUNITY LEARNED."
However, according to the current show, Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "it was itself and it's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying music or his clothing or by supporting his "art"), who I think welcomes and spreads the ideology that is worthy of society.
He's free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, and now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following Didi's example, also known as Puff Dede, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lyon, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
A charge of attempted murder after stabbing a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the magistrate's court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be handled by the D.A.
The star of "The Game of Thrones" Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for the role of the waving John Snow sword in the violent medieval fantasy series of NGO "The Game of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, declared himself against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be "serious" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeTo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from the "Play of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits that he feels "hardly convinced" that this problem should be solved.
"At the moment, I am firmly convinced – what have we confused about manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach older men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to many manly characters.
He continued: “What is inborn and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes the boys feel like they need to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in the history or extensions of the Game of Thrones after the end of the series next summer, claiming that he "had finished with the fighting fields and horses".
Since November, Keith will be participating in Sam Shepherd's True West Recovery, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened at the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life forward," he said.
Rose is playing Igrit, the girl that Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with, uh, fantasy show, award-winning Amy.
Both married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% rise in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
HlV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the spread of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, according to the Chinese Health Services at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the communities of the KGB is widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men are eventually married to women.
Many of the cases of disease transmission are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there is a leak of data from the Republican Party, condemns "the dangerous lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, US House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three US senators from the Republicans on the pages of the lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The L.A. Democratic said the allegations were made by experts and sites of the "ultra right wing".
"He lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on charges of immoral sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My team member – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"There is anger in this denial," said Fletcher.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to act challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fletcher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Cavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics that he also seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' post in the interim elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"Actually, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had questioned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my team members."
John English's review erupts again – the weak spy parody with Rohan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Breckzit in every new film with British participation and it seems that this also applies to the rebirth of the action comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returned in 2011 with "Johny English returns".
Will self-smiling and mimes, which say how obvious it is that we are stupid, become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes wide open and a rubber face has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is of utmost importance when it comes to the great comical creation intended for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering glamour owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr Bean and much of the man who contributed with a note to the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, it was originally based on the leaving mess behind a traveller and an international man who Atkinson played in the already forgotten television commercials of Barclay.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there's either two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a little while, the feathers ran into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely surplused, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humour seems rather focused on children rather than on adults, but Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused, as there is no game of Aktinson reminding Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operative agents for the terror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Teza-Mei role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she needs to call some retired agent because all the agents in operation are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chico center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons about how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English re-creates a spy rock academy.
English was summoned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a joyous role in which the talent of Vicky Pepperdine has been little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's Secret Service and face the fatally beautiful Ofelia Bullettova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the perilous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their odyssey from farces: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak on the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the house of Volta.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since they're so cute and lush, there's a lot more content here for children.
Quite a mediocre production.
Just like other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Labourists deny that they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work four weeks, but to get paid for five.
The party claims it wants company bosses to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers, giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fall" the party's economic programme and plans to shake the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that before the end of the year, politics will be notified.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that fits into the economic rebalancing approach for the benefit of workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At present, however, this pursuit does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour speaker said, "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy. "
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from "impersonal directors" and "speaks" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour Government could impose "retentions" on the basis of the infringements found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to put workers on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital to private companies of employees who can raise annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak before "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has slowed down his final vote for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could force some of the senators from the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60-minute correspondent" Scott Pelli asked the senators of the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the event, after that claim came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavanaugh and in order to change it, it is necessary to press charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett definitely denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blassius Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and does it even help reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: to eliminate poverty around the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendez, but will also know the true purpose of the event – the removal of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” as a voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, calling on the phone or connecting otherwise in order to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizens 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to demand action or is it simply another case of "cliticism" – people think they are doing something significant when signing an online petition or sending a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters who insist on a number of different purposes.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equal to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and communications resulting from its actions as already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group considers that the funds already provided had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the "Food Force", established in the UK a partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35m to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4700 Twitter posts have been received by global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historical note," Ambassador of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman told the audience of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken that call for Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government reported on financing a project, "The Food Force", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the PSCs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
A Global Citizen replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But just as in the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Sean Mendez, Cardy Bee, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Ley Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use naval forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – the Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zinc, as Washington Examiner quoted him as saying.
Zinc argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zinc addressed the event, organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is presented as the "vote of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuels," he said, while defining Russia as a "one-number pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with strengthening the exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the North Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump turns Berlin hostage.
Moscow has stressed several times that the 11 billion-dollar pipeline of North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's zealous opposition to the project has been dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German organisation in the industry, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would "take a serious look" at the presidential bid after the interim elections.
During the city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman at the top," according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren expressed his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was honest in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a post on Twitter on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological study conducted Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The sociological survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent for and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed with regard to potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSR to Track Palin at a rally on Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after writing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are coming home," she told an audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and told his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little changed, hardened, returning and wondering whether they will receive this respect that they and their brothers have given the country by arms."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a non-treasury weapon, according to Dan Bennett, spokeswoman of the police administration of Vasila.
18 State and District of Colombia Support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the US's judicial challenge to a new policy that refuses asylum to the victims of gangsta and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the district applied for goodwill in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging politics, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the claimant in the Grace vs. Sessions case was not disclosed, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang members" were harassing her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's been held in Texas.
U.S. attorneys helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom come from asylum candidates in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The US's new asylum policy has restored the decision of the 2014 immigration council, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum documents that escape domestic violence.
Colombian lawyer Karl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be reviewed according to specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle," the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants damages the US economy, noting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary working hand".
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in immigration cases to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gang violence.
"A refuge is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political convictions," Sessions said in a communication on politics on 11 July.
The refuge was never intended to ease all problems – not all serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate Rescue Efforts in Palu, While Death Cases Double During Search for Survived
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save some of their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake with a magnet of 7.5 are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were placed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the broken wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with the family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then she fell silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China for "torture" with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page ad in the US daily on the benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's indictment that Peckie is trying to intervene for the US congress, noted what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently taking part in an escalating trade war that equitrates import tariffs between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were meant to hit exporters in the States such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had spared US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in comments in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "currently doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China took advantage of America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, at a newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's disturbing economic trend, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids publishing the proposal" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh's troupe, Republicans repel women's voters for the interim elections, caution analysts
As many high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominations to Brett Cavanaugh on several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a response, in particular from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions around the pan are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be brought back," Grant Raher, a political professor at Maxwell University School in Syracuse, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether the insistence at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progress group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington daily.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Noemvri is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judiciary decided to proceed with Cavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasius Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among the voters of women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominations, analysts suggest a response may follow if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is put on the stand. It is about the way Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," Guy Cecile, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats.
But the Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little more prone to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the responders definitely or probably believe Ford's statements, and 35 percent say that they definitely or possibly believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that they believe Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate's judicial committee that Cavanaugh attacked her in an unsettled state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee begins an endeavor aimed at competing on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company that builds the open source platform of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Ley, it is a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the undertaking.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or “pod”.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all at the same time.
The unique thing about the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "the granting of authority for personal data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company invests resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Leigh, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several subsidiaries that contracted work on the project, and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Burners-Leigh said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated in one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Leigh wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although starting the Inrupt, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest, awarded the cross of Victoria during World War I
It is marked for 100 years in the hometown of the only English priest, awarded the cross of Victoria for his participation in combat activities during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the event of the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without knowing that he was awarded the highest military honors of Britain.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic ” to discover exactly 100 years of his grandfather’s case, awarded with a medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Queen "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
Later, he attacked the fire line and with "amazing courage" led me forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it is "a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally witness the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock, just when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, the viewers in Britain remained stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were up until early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fen described on Twitter the switching of the children's animated film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme was replaced by a children's broadcast," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said they would work on planning meetings to include British viewers in the future.
"According to me, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"But there is six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will be held here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We will adhere to the inclusion of five fights instead of six – as usual. We tried to provide ourselves more to fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The water Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be interested less than winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent host of the longtime show, Kirsty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his participation in Laverne Daley's first program, he said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of inadequacy and that I am different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he is doing this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – US director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprised”.
Daley married Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young” – he participated for the first time in the Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Daley himself says that "his whole view" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about is whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there for me, Dad, or the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at the moment when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that my whole life I had dreamed of it – jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no more awesome feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – who accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still made him freak out.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British Summer Time.
Michaelson's lost shape stays on the Rayder Shower stand Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rayder Cup game, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be tied to failure.
Mikelson, who participated in a two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the stand by Captain Jim Furik for "fourball" and "foursom" matches Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again on the U.S. team, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in this to train his punches from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career was never among the most legal players, is not in optimal form for the difficult playground of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the field itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth game of Sunday, Michaelson will face the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who is on the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all four games this week.
If Americans who are behind four points before the 12 singles match make a strong start, it might turn out that Michaelson's game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything very different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and in this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing only in two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how it worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most matches at Ryder Drago, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career at Ryder Drag, which never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team, which are not measured by figures.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to joke with people and is a great person for every team," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be melted
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage, accumulated before the single matches of Ryder Drago's last day, can be easily erased.
The Danish debuted in the "Valderrama" game in 1997, when the team with Captain Sve Ballisteros led five points to the Americans, but right on the final line was almost caught and barely managed to hold on to the 14-13th.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead on Valderrama; we had a big lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama we won, but very hard,” said Bjorn, after the team of Europe from 2018 won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, which led with 10-6 of “Le Golf National:.
So history has to show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score of the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All this time I've been saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals who are one of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush to the celebrations.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you put your entire capacity to the test as a golfer.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you must do your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must also be given to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to act better individually than as partners, with exceptions only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great reverses in the last day – he was part of the triumph of "Brookline", and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans did "The Wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krishna, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to do the same good start as you saw on "Brookline" as on "Medinah".
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous tension.
That's why we formed our band and distributed our boys as we wish, so we could try to make the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading our counter-attack and facing Rory McAllroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said of his choice for singles.
Germany again postpones the launch of a new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 in order to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will not take place until at least next year because of the faulty systems and the ghastly growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, is delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The vessel was to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four class-Baden-Wuertemberg ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aged Bremen frigates.
Understandably, they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ray missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of home.
However, continuous delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The accident frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship to a ship builder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of essential "computer and hardware defects" that make the military ship unusable if it is sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages are particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has proved that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the possibility of the naval forces adding future superstructures.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including for crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is believed to have reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is actually "exhausting itself from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships were derived from operation but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no class frigate of Baden-Wuertemberg could be included in the fleet.
The national reed follows the secret life of bats
A new study carried out at a mansion in the Scots Mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
Hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Cane of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as the brown archery watery nightgowns at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places at the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will establish the frequency of bat appeal sounds, as well as of which species they issue.
A map of the habitat and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and Britain overall decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their havens and lead to loss of habitats.
The risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Trust has trained experts who conduct regular research, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve at the Threave mansion in the Dumfreys and Galloway area, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson mansion says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a great field for bats," he noted.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and completed suitable habitats.
But there are many more things about bats that are unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He points out that it is important to check for bats before real estate maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible for the involuntary destruction of an asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, and to destroy an entire local population.
The glues are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their refuges.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in Trusta for bat protection, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, since we just don’t know what happens to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will be suing the German journalistic magazine Derbach, which published these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Katherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Derbach reported on Friday.
In the video in Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, several hours after the publication of the allegations 33-year-old Ronaldo swore the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the Golden Ball's five-time carrier said in front of the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get popular on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Derbach for claims they call "an unacceptable publication of suspicions in the area of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
It is said that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where she was said to have been raped anally, according to documents filed in the County Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the accident Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of "99%", but in the case he simply gave in to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they were having sex, but that happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "absorbed by revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is wanted to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma to the incident in question.
At the time of the accident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Grand Yuventus for a sum of 100m euros.
Breckzit: Britain "will regret forever" that it has lost car manufacturers
The UK "will be sorry forever", if it loses its status as world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "disturbing" that the Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Burton, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of stalling the border in the case of Breckzit without a deal could lead to job losses.
Last year, nearly 150 000 cars were produced in the factory in Burton, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burton.
Other producers of cars from Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll shut down their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brecksit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks to the supply chain in the case of Breckzit without a deal.
Toyota's production line is working on the ‘accurate timing’ principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both Britain and the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which according to the industry could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher plant, the company said, and so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "shachmat" plan for a future relationship with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in the program 4's Today on BBC Radio.
"After claims not only to Toyota, but also to other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term warns that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burundi for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience I judge that if these jobs leave, they will never return.
A government spokeswoman said, "We have put out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein can be "scheduled by another week", as the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Cavanaugh continues to fight, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, ties between Trump's assistants and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy chief prosecutor, or not, and thus threatens Muller's independence has been feeding the rumors of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, a meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate's legal committee, which was witnessed both by Cavanaugh and by one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Cavanaugh, even more delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may not be a date for this week yet, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be delayed for next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10th.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences are not because of the "demonstrative behaviour" of television journalists, although he said: "I cannot say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts several sessions with questions and answers from every president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We try to do it often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking persons.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of fellow journalists.
Health Minister Addresses EU Workers in Scotland National Health Service for Fears related to Brekzit
The health minister addressed EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service in writing to express the state's appreciation and desire to keep them in place after the Breckzit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months until Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the cost of establishing procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on abandonment continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure it's a very insecure period for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers' Linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma during a meeting on Saturday, when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the halftime.
"He went to the side line and somehow just fainted there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics submitted oxygen to Abercrombi on the side line before it was placed on a stretcher and taken to the locker rooms for additional examination.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/serious nature of the trauma", and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, second-grader with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State since his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he did a total of five blockages before leaving the match, which makes a total of 18 blockage for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher back order when buying real estate in Britain
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher back-up account when buying real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the back of the bill will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher back-up order to purchase real estate in Britain, with additional revenues to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the back order will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues to support the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current back-up account, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of giving – can amount to up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to 120 million British pounds annually.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for the first time to intervene in the real estate market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "spiritual cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy appears only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the back of his account to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property by taking up land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave housing quotas to correct Britain's "familiary" housing.
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control over rents and the end of the "no guilt" expulsions.
He also wants to give the council greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies to buy as easy housing as those who work hard in Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the defamation of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the team of Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge of reviving the club from northeastern England, which currently ranks third in the First League, at three points in the first place.
He went to Stadium Of Light this summer after last season he took St. Miren back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team and that was all," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsund.
"But I grew up with the Scotland matches of Hampden, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"But this opportunity would only open if I had success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers are names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moose, Sam Allordys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
A former Aloa Atletik's teacher said he did not experience anxiety as an heir to such established names at a similar famous club, before he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It will not be easy to return to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years since he spent some time as an assistant at Dumberton and 15 months at Harts' coaching headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miren from a falling team to a winner at Champianship in the next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
“I was really at the crossroads,” he recalls when he took Aloa.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best place for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds weird because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player sometimes is hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin my whole conscious life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals a study
Summer heat has increased the incomes of struggling to survive British pubs, but has accumulated more tension for the chains of restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the business-consultant CGA, who composed the statistics, said: "Because of the prolonged solar time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar model as in June, when pubs reported an increase of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline by 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in height compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Dogs with meals also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In the pubs and bars, the sales of beverages jumped 6.6 percent per month, while there was a 3 per cent reduction in food."
Paul Newman, an analyst of relaxation and entertainment, told RSM: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remains the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although the decline in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will thus bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the spread of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a confirmed indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides from their parents a secret social network profile
One in five children – some only 11 – has a secret social network profile that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Insta pages
News raises fears that material with sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" profile that showed their parents
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps a secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students shows an increase in fake Insta accounts – a reference to Instagram photo sharing website.
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile that showed their parents, while having secret profiles.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret site who discovered a teenage child who encouraged others to "rape him".
The study conducted by the Digital Aware UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Alyd Doyle will be “the voice of the athletes ” in the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Alyd Doyle was elected to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without the executive functions of the annual general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and President Ian Beatty has defined this move as a great opportunity for those who lead to sports to take advantage of its rich international experience over the last decade.
"Elyd enjoys great respect in the light-athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly with its attraction," said Byte.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I really hope that I can contribute and help promote sports in Scotland. ”
The American who won the finals of the 200 and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator in BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump that compares mothers to cows splits online opinions
A dairy pump company has divided online opinions by advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding cows.
In order to note the placing on the market of the expected ‘first noiseless breast pump in the world suitable for wear’, the company for consumer technologies Elvie has released the funny music video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the sucklers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack of cows, in the background of a song with a text, including: “Yes, I do, but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not fair, it’s my breasts. ”
The song continues: “I pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, breast - feed my friends. ”
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it degrades “the horrors ” of the dairy industry.
‘It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie breast-feeding pump is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is perfectly understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: “So much inadequate advertising. ”
Others have protected advertising, with a woman admitting that she thinks the song is “extremely fun. ”
"According to me, the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Draining me made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote someone.
Another comment: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who squeeze (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
This is not an advertising that praises or condemns the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in a breast-feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they drain.
Anna Balarin, a partner and creative director in Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release on the market.
With the drawing of a parallel between sucklers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with this, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump falls into the news.
During the Fashion Week in London the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Martha Yakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being moved secretly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly because the sharp rhetoric and policy of Trump's administration made it difficult for children to accommodate with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults from the family should provide fingerprints, with this data shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or members of the family of the guardians reside illegally in the country, with most of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In an effort to cope faster with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not in person, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those identified as inappropriate to permit will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to officials at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as the Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to “the Palatach city, ” without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends, may make it difficult for many to cope with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops reside illegally on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will take the appropriate action".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost to its end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been violently evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" by both terrorist organisations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 military officers in Syria who are principally training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian units, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of the devastated country of war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions are tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western countries of "exhaling groundless fears" that move refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue something that is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided for the recovery of Syria until political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major fortress of the Idlib rebels provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by supporters of Russia's Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action will be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda al-Qaeda front "Al Nusra", who will "be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic Trump will win a reelection in 2020, unless – as many liberal viewers probably hope – his presidency is suspended prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
That would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There are no signs of the viewers' fatigue right now.
From 2014 on, the prime-time rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where it tells of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after attacking the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, who is a veteran comedy screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her cab driver said he'd vote for Mr Trump.
She asked, “Why? ”
Mrs. Scowell told me that he said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can come together again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this at six o'clock to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Streh"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket from Streus's Skin for $15,000 (a garment filled with arrogance) according to the Washington Post), and the shaking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I will especially never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"The honor of what he is doing to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, with regard to changing participants and daily turns (hungry with the National Football League, praise Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fly this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kawai, 80 degrees, but he was closed at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal commission and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Fleece told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments are being invested in the most disputed race in early Congress elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is receiving a stream of money, thanks to the rearrangement of Congress districts and hence two holders for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in Pittsburgh's suburbs lists conservative democracy Connor Lamb, who won his post from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which is significantly in favour of the new 17th.
The maps were drawn again after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widespread partial elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The position was occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella from Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because "the recent decisions would no longer be recognised by Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Department earlier this month.
However, sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, which received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for the fight against drugs, with the aim of development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cut-off of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state with its unemployment and percentage of the killings.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves for such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the US.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities stated that their wish was to have the conference taken place, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Penses announced he would participate in a conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US MPs silently returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report by special adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, and the report is currently a significant proof in the public register.
It is said that Mr. Muller is also pointing his investigation to whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If Congress's leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr Trump will have to be accounted for in front of this body, just when he is about to face the voters, as well as perhaps by jury members made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not believe that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit a state coup against Hitler, as long as the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the clan.
The walk of history depends on such a time of nobility, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are currently facing several similar knots.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper announced that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the Times story is incorrect.
"How would we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, required by the FBI, is not full or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, would we vote in the Congress's early elections if this would force Mr Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits her long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because I have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for the Sabbath at that table, carrying the swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Brukings Institute, is chairman of "Citizens of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the rapprochement with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G League of Europe.
A knee contusion did not allow half-protector Graham Dorans to play his first game for the season before the 2-2 equation in question with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a tramplin to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old football player said.
"We entered the match with the hope that we could win something and leave with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened along my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone the wrong way.
The team's good and the boys are really having fun, the training's useful.
I hope we can harness all our strengths to forget last season and achieve the desired successes."
Women worry about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they wanted to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in a Nationwide study share that they discussed their long-term care costs with their husbands.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide's life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Together with your adviser and your family discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the costs.
Please include your financial advisor: your advisor can also help you with the idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when choosing a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal papers: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Please appoint a healthcare officer so that you have a certain trustee to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Display these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, it's about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
"What are the drugs like?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home tonight.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police describe the shooting that took place around 0:30 British summer time as "a random act".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the number of dead to rise.
Due to interrupted communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala regentship, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnetode earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency which the administrative region is less than the province is approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami hit the west end of Dongala in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the western coast of Indonesia’s Acech province in North Sumatra activates a wave of tsunamis, which hit 14 countries and destroyed 226 000 people throughout the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of the city of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island off the coasts of contentatra.
2006: Truss with a magnetod 6,8 cut down the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed in the southern coast, destroying nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnetode 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnetus 7.5 cut one of the islands of Mentawi and activated a 10-foot tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastations of deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, tsunamis are not activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes cut the island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in the wind.
Sarah Pailin's biggest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Pailin, former governor of Alaska's biggest son and Vice President Sarah Paylin's candidate, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, a 29-year-old from Wassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in a domestic violence and resistance alert to arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Pailin is detained in the Matt-Su pre-restraint building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certainly", when asked for a plea, media reported.
Pailin is threatened with punishment for three Class A lashes, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with class B leprosy, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Pailin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of intoxicating substances in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he hit her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Pailin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that cut the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The earthquake with a magnetode of 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks have been cut off, with the number of dead expected to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near the central Sulavesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia - Jakarta.
Social media is running videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist assassination in New York, in which eight people were killed -- a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a rental truck at Home Depot to launch the bombing in October on a bike in the vicinity of West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists along its way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily damage, according to a notification of intent regarding the request for capital punishment filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judicial team went to Saipov's 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with a racket used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of the ICJ.
The attack required "serious planning and intent", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "horrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Hamibulajevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Earli, Ernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern area has been looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York on a federal case was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police say.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked for the IDIL flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they are "apparently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to seek a death sentence rather than to accept a guilty and life sentence without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously requested that the D.A.'s office not demand a death sentence.
Parliamentary member of the conservatives says NIJUL PHARAJ should lead the BLexite negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Party of Independence said politicians should "feel pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party suggested that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out by now", if Mr. Farage had been secretary for the Brekzit issues.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to address the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who supported the stay, who joined a separate protest against Brekzit, in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by supporters of Brexit, supporters of the EU as well.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between its package and "the chaos".
Mr. Bonn told the protesters with the slogan "Exit means exit" in Solichel that he wanted to "toss Chequers".
He stressed that Mr Farage should have cooperated with the rest of them, and that he had to be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The MEP from Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Saying his opposition attitude toward the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be industrious.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The understanding that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false”.
The conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, sharing with reporters: “I am simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us be elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel pressure" if they are to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Breckzit and we've gathered here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing the Brexite, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has helped us to win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-rule, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a hike in Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists were raising flags with "Conservators Against Brekzit" inscriptions after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for the security of the party's application when he opened up at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, and more, about the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he will "think seriously" his bid for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would " seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that a Democratic Representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Dale, who was the joint president of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the centre of speculation that she could take Trump's post in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holioke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall after Trump entered office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is high time that "women go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top".
An arrest has been made for the death of Simms from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in Friday's shooting when the LSU basketball player Wade Simms was killed.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported on the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, at a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who saw it on the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a gun and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson has been arrested in good faith and detained in the arrest of the police department of East Baton Rouge.
A young man 6′6′′ who grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms participated in 32 matches with 10 dates as the holder of last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches of the match.
Gran Prie of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him beat Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Valteri Botas was ranked earlier than Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously troubled Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, giving Fetel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
The festival first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next round and went after the Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat it after a bold maneuver and driving a ‘tire to the tire’, which forced Ferrari's pilot with the unwillingness to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double protective maneuver on the third turn.
On my 21st birthday, Max Verstappen began from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first tour.
Then he even ran over a pretty long period of the race, since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly outrun Kimmy Rykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the pit stop on the 44th tour, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight rounds and eventually Rikonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Walter did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me out of his way.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the platform," Hamilton said.
That really was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finestein on a rally Saturday because of her claim that she didn't spread a letter from Christine Blaze Ford, accusing the claimant of Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally discussion in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and the beauty that has become the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see angry people and the wicked, and the disgusting, and the dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the publications and the distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Finestein, did it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Finestein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Cavanaugh as early as July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Finestein denied that this spread occurred from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Finestein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep my privacy and I kept my confidentiality as she wanted."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented during Saturday night’s rally: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the claimant for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that the Democrats are using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonor, the shame, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Giants versus Dundee.
Dundy Stars came back for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a five-to-three match on Saturday.
Giants took her early to the two-naked game after Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilleer were hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney evened out for the housewives before Duyer regained the advantage of Giants.
François Bushar leveled for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m. with the assistance of Kendal McFaul, and then David Ruderford doubled the advance, as an assistant to Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the help of the County at 15:16.
Duyer tried to get Giants to take her before the first vacation, score a second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar rebalanced the odds with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
Kaoney and Charles Corcoran united efforts to help Nilsen give Dundy the lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, and he did his best to consolidate the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who have lost the last four matches in a total of five meetings, welcome as hosts Milton Keens for their next match on Friday.
A flight manager was killed to make sure hundreds of people on board could escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers aboard managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck Sulavezi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong secondary shocks continued to strike the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway at that time, would manage to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was going down.
Later, he died in the hospital.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia Johannes Sirate said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six metres, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There's marauders everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joco Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was cut by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that a person is unknown after a plane crash in the lagoon
The plane that made the plane crash into a lagoon in the Pacific is now reporting that one person has been reported missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they are working together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. naval forces said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane passed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane has gone very low.
"This is extremely nice," Janes said.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to run through the deep to the cross of water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head trauma.
The U.S. naval forces say that sailors repairing a nearby port also helped in the rescue operation, using an inflatable boat to get people to the coast before the plane went down in the depths of about 30 metres of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have been killed on flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
The analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded its statement on this Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlet of the US Department of Justice has been testifying for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was "a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said she knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis' death, he deleted text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
Defence is planned to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that the hip-hop has deviated from its origins on political statements and engagement with social problems.
They want to return to its roots and promote the conscientious hip-hop again.
Artists of the type of The Fugees and Common are reborn in Britain through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New Yorker sues a couple after firing a "racist" message
A New Yorker sues a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a misspelled message from a mother who complains that she is “the next black person. ”
The couple deny being racists, likening a request for “extortion. ”
Lyndsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was amazed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, OTHER BLACKHAIR," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flexman in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was African-American, did not do her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a day's work then sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for firing, asking for $350 a day for the six-month contract she was initially hired for, even though she didn't have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do this," she told Post on Friday, adding "You're sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the termination of Morris's employment was a reasonable act, as they feared they would not be able to trust her once they had insulted her.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco, his husband, told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Similar to “extortion, ” Plasco claims that his wife had only been born two months ago and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"Are you going to attack someone in this state?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the case is still under trial, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not feel a connection with a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's so much fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before inspired himself to write the children's book about a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about possible rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was quite a modest man and was not a boastful one," she said.
"But since you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child who's accomplished something: you're proud of him, although it's not really your case.
I think you kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the merits of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation is really bad that she does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say he will die in two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She left a while before that, and that's how it all ended.
I should've just sat there and waited, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should've been in the cold."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who is still grieving for the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she is going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had put my head down, and all the while my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this engulfing feeling of compassion with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women put up cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by smile.
They always said his smile brightens every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving and was in “a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to let people know that there is someone to go to and who to talk to, even if this is a friend.
Do not remain silent – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor at anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope: “It opens up a void in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must move forward and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI starts investigating
I thought whether we can really achieve what he wants – an investigation of limited duration and limited scope – perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "disintegrating" despite the hard-line overparty blockage.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
They don't want it because of the moment itself.
Early elections are only in five weeks, on November 6th – if Republicans are not expected to be well presented, they will seriously suffer their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the state.
George W. Bush calls the senators, invites them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and meets his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has prepared his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea “reduces ” in Kim
South Korean legislation claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sugg, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were 1127 fugitives last year, as compared in 2011, they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human traffickers, are key factors.
There's no official comment on the part of the company.
Most of the refugees from the North end up getting citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is more easily passed than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcefully repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state met in the two countries for talks focused on the stalemate in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Une in Singapore, where they agreed to generally work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way that we will first unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "exterior" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Congress minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "exterior" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her "exterior", Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate legal committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected claims that he had committed sexual exposure to Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, almost shouting and feeling when he discussed his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on the person", organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced about the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and with the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when she was asked if she would try to discredit Cavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unable to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now in," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions regarding the Law on Accessing Health Care or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In preliminary hearings, Cavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for an hysterical, preconvinced person to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it great," Pelosi finished.
And women have to be mastered.
It's a valid criticism, after months and years of scattered rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinum told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, but you?"
She continued, “I got huge help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who said that she was crying too when she got angry, but developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she told her neighbour, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought that was genius."
Tears are allowed in expressions of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of my previous work, in the office mostly with men, is how once, while I hustled with unspeakable rage, a woman older than me grabbed me by the door – a freezing leader that I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did this to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marry relationship with a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well thought out decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was for another one to appear.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
As it gets involved late in the campaign, it lags behind in raising funds and decides it will not stay in the race if it fails to raise $2m.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, in which he declares that he will not continue with the official campaign, she is overrun by so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction against the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and be able to turn to voters rather than delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I have suffered a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
“Someone may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would they write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is still gaining speed, an outbreak between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning valve this year, betting taxes on key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of tension occurred this week with new duties affecting the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion UK pounds) with an effective tax on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Every time, Beijing retaliated with new bribes, with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every blow of the United States and soon it is not expected that the second largest world economy will ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to bring it down publicly to Washington would be too embarrassing for C. Jinpin, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards right, the pressure from the trade war with the United States can help in the long term China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political solution both in Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have admitted before," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate on issues related to Asia to the expert group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in the restoration of a war-ravaged country that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem stressed that conditions in the state are improving.
"Today the situation in place is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by the terrorists to return them to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their diet.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Ryder Drag in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Drag for 2018, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 per 10.5 of Le Golf National in the Paris area, France.
Thus, the United States has six consecutive losses on European land and has not won Ryder Drag in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to its championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The US star, Phil Michaelson, who presented himself weakly in most of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented himself excellently in all the events, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance of 5-0-0, ever since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite has lost adamantly 5&4 to the player in the team of Europe, which is the lowest in the rankings – Torbørn Olesen of Denmark.
World Ranger leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, probably the last of Ryder's Cups.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in Ryder Drago, became the European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing his asset to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
All that matters is the team and I am happy to be able to help," the excited Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He is handing over his countryman John Ram, who beat US legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall balance of Ryder's Cup is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles – an indicator that only gives Jack Niklaus a stand-up.
The U.S. team was having a hard time all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf all the days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furik shared after the disappointing presentation of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
At one time this morning we pressed the team of Europe.
There was a fight.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players showed up very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our Committee on Ryder Bath and look ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you don't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just outplayed."
