Members of the Vatican Assembly are concerned that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the assembly are threatened by the proposal to be named MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc. Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valizan Parliament.
Members of the assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that their group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed other options.
The Valizan conservative said that his group of "open spirit" regarding the change of name, while pointing out that there is a small difference between the words MWP and Muppet in the statement.
In this context, the expression of the Welsh letter “w” is similar to the expression “u” in the Yorkshiric phrase.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing draft legislation to present changes to the name, said: "The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the assembly will, of course, have to be taken by members themselves."
By law, the Wallisan Assembly has been empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to amend its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the assembly of the Valizan Parliament.
As members of the Assembly, the Commission has chosen the name "Wellsh Parliament Member" or "WMP", but in the public consultation, the most support was given the option of "MWP".
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching an agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who has to submit draft legislation on amendments within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of members of the assembly and the establishment of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the legislative debate in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians to decide on country name change by referendum
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote seeks to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they must pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church have been silent since the churches in Harlem are facing difficulties
“The older people I talked to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Adams.
“There is no one today or any other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize differently.
Bars are no longer living room neighborhoods where people regularly go."
In churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be at the beginning again.
He added that churches could be replaced with residential buildings with joint administration (condominium), where people who would not help shelter in the neighborhood who were still left will live.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that’s why the day will come soon when all these churches are closed, as it is unlikely that people who will move to these condoms will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decades later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community who served in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s was taken over by the Black Religious Community under the leadership of Honorable John Howard Johnson, who, on 125th Street, was the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who refused to hire or support the dark people.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered the doorbells.
The church of St. Martin’s, the son of Father Johnson, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor people.”
The expert, who won in July, called them a little different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first pin bells played by a dark-pold musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he ran into larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced by St. Martin’s Church.
The church of St. Martin’s has a complex story with architects and contractors over the past few months; some have brought church laymen and others a bishop.
In July, Zachristia, a parish administrative body consisting of laymen, wrote to the bishop to worry that the bishop would "try to transfer the costs" to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the bishop.
Shark injured 13-year-olds hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday, California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old man while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends when he heard the boy scream for help, and then with the group he sailed to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just thrilled because he caught the lobster, and then he realized he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a full keypad torn apart.
"I cried out to everyone to leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A lifeguard from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that a few weeks earlier a shark was spotted in this area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper torso.
They have disabled access for 48 hours from Ponto Beach Beach in Casablanca to Swami’s beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s planning entry into the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s coming to Boots, Super-Others and Debenhams with beautiful cats as they have in the storerooms, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while the sale of clothing and household appliances is dropping, the larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores per country and the following year in several shops if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used before for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say that they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and first include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing supply of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also receive more space in trade mark areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
Supermarket is also resuscitating its buttful range of cosmetic products, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury shops. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham until the end of the year.
Online shopping and daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops require supermarkets to make more efforts to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores will be similar to wholesale stores, as the chain of supermarkets tries to fight Aldi and Lidl’s discount with several services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury Group’s opened outlets Argos in several hundred shops and also the sales of the Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased the sale of food and the acquisitions were more profitable.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended successfully.
Sainsbury’s took a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the relationship ended after the dispute over the distribution of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play his part in this plan, as they were supposed to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands in four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for counselling.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, which poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is "angry" because Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from business worth £11 million.
The star of Dragons Dan (Good Business) is furious because TV host Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from the business worth £11 million with his life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and supplements, Truly.
The company of the business couple was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of this Morning, 37, posted on Instagram to withdraw.
Holly Willoughby was furious with the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones, as she had recently withdrawn from their lucrative life-style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “angry” when the golden girl of television admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that because of her new business, worth up to £1.5 million, she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their brand of clothing and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and predicted to double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly’s brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw was absolutely astounded by everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlowe there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the Head of this Morning, which is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, this may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother, three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were ten years of good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby was founded by Truly, together with Cappova in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones, joined them as president in March.
In addition, Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I’m A Celebrity show.
A source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked about media criticism over a comment that some think is "non-presidential" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his mocking "journalist" voice:
“I have not yielded anything.”
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting, and their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "adequate response" to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States is continuing to impose sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve their relationship with Kim had brought positive results — they stopped testing rockets, helped free hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers after death.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It can be very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded full scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said and pointed out to the crowd directly ahead of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, when addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs have been told that they do not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were relocated, they did not declare natural disasters, a condition for sending international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
He told Sutopou, a representative of the national disaster agency, that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu and determine whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the country remains completely unprepared for nature's rage.
In Aceh, shelters were built by tsunami, but on other shores it is not a common practice.
The obvious absence of a warning siren for tsunamis in Paluje probably contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Travelling among many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the earthquake victims, is sailing towards Paluje, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit presents a problem for Yok's administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hit for late equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's fine 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal in the back of his 1-0 team.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote door.
The arrow traveled high above the penitentiary to the right upper corner of the door.
The ball finally came down through the doorman of Kepa Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq, always dragging it as far as I could, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much more and simply decided to shoot.”
At halftime, Chelsea led 1-0 with a hit by Belgian actor Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the Blue Man gave the ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly gave up in the middle and ran forward.
Then he put it through the defense and Hazzard ran into the penitentiary.
Hazzard beat the defense and shot his left foot against a remote doorway through Liverpool's doorman, Alisson Becker.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions' League.
Chelsea is in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. for Videoton in the League of Europe.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832, the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
A representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency said that there were a lot of people due to an earthquake rate of 7.5, which triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
The Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseysid.
A 44-year-old girl with stab wounds was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews building on John Street and was arrested for suspected murder by a 32-year-old man.
Police are calling everyone in the area who's seen or heard a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead Street and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the camera footage to get in touch with us because they may have information that is crucial for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police are informing the family of the woman.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
They now told the residents that it could take several hours before they could enter again.
The police heard him explain to a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying "this is so terrible".
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and another one just outside.
Many police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
All those who have any information ask to write at @MerPolCC shall call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111, indicating the daily 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of the dispute over the "rewritten writing of history"
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical supporters of puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society marked Crick’s proposal as “stupid” and “a rewritten history attempt”.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s discussion on the removal of statues, it became clear that Oliver Cromwell’s image outside the Westminist palace would become a target.”
The Ikonoclasm in the English civil wars Cromwell neither ordered nor executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor from the last century.
The excellent presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of the 19th - century opinion is part of the history of personality, which some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is many (perhaps even more late in the 19th century than today) seen as the protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate performance is the subject of continuous historical debates.
Clearly, in the middle of the 17th century, the conflict formed a further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord Protector also deserve celebration and memory.”
A killing pig crushed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media, he attacked and killed a farmer at a market in the southwest of China.
A man identified only by the last name "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near the pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, was reported at the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing for vaccination on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, my cousin and I were supposed to travel from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's pig with a bloody mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig crushed a farmer to death.
“The brothers’ legs were bloody and dim,” quoted a cousin named “Wu” as quoted by the newspaper Guyang Evening News.
Security footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned so that he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have already been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering severe physical injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then the wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not attacking, but the taste in blood can act as a “producer”.
»We would just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown sufficient respect," he said.
To the southwest of the United States, because of the remains of Hurricane Rosa, heavy rains are coming
According to predictions, hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico and is getting weaker.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, as of Sunday from 5.00 a.m. in the eastern time of the 1st category hurricane.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-air pressure area moving east towards the western coast of the United States is being strengthened. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture mixed with the low-air pressure area will create abundant rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, the disposal of floods and the possibility of earth’s landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In southwest parts, especially above most of Arizona, rainfalls are expected from 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn canyons into decoupling rivers, and storms will bring local wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
There may be rainfalls above 12 mm, which may result in a minor suspension of floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy period.
A few scattered tropics will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoon and Monday morning, late Monday and Tuesday, the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rains will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central United States.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is 20 degrees difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most Central and Eastern U.S. will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, we could have 27 degrees [27 °C] on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees [10 degrees] above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the US average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on six television networks have seen the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who was accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path of the position continued, as television stations cut off the regular programme due to the last minute turnover: the deal forged by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI would conduct a unitary investigation into the charges.
Fordova told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been touching her in wine state and trying to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a vexable testimony that he was 100% convinced that this had not happened.
Nielsen reports that Friday’s witness is expected to see more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS television networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks which provided a witness, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with counting viewers who watch the program in offices.
In order to facilitate the performance, ratings are similar to those in the performance of the final football game or the award of the American Film Academy.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, is leading all day's hearing before all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
In second place, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanough, on Friday morning the cameras of CNN and CBS television networks recorded how the protesters screamed at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the Justice Committee.
During his construction, he hung up for a few minutes, which was captured live by CNN TV cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman.
"You think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office had made a statement and added that he would say more at the hearing of the committee and then the doors of the elevator closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the transfer of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate vote.
But Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority Democratic Party called.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was decisive because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh by the U.S. Federal Investigation Office (FBI).
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "playing political games" at Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans for leaving the European Union of “playing political games” with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Brexit Plan from Chequers" and said that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay customs to each other was "all absurd".
Shots fired at Wade Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of the death of an LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team.
After reporting from the Baron Rouge police, a 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for second-degree murder charges.
Officials posted a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation and the police indicated that Sims had lost his sunglasses during the battle.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and Simpson's DNA, CBS TV, complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
A surveyor from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking the special task force for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest for the fugitives of the Lousian state police, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the police of the South University and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU team Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "care and justice"
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, on average, he collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, the team coach LSU Will Wade said that the team was "wrestled" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
“That’s what you’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Vulcan Vomiting Ash on Ciudad de Mexico
The ash vomited by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National disaster prevention centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunder and earthquake suns.
The pictures on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering windscreens of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics observed an increased activity in a volcano that lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-degree earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called “Don Goyo”, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters who support independence faced anti-accident police units and joined thousands of people in a rival demonstration marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised secession vote.
A group of masked separatist supporters, held back by anti-disappropriate police units, cast eggs and metal on powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were fights, and police officers had to use the pendecks to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who cried out for hours "without forgetting, without forgiveness", faced Protestants who supported unity and cried out "Let Spain Live!".
According to local media, fourteen people in the protests suffered minor injuries.
The year following the referendum of 1 October, which was designated illegal in Madrid, and the Catalan separatists celebrated it, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although participation was low, as opposers of the secession largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the region's polls in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence camped outside the elections overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another path.
A 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no more hope that Catalonia would become independent.
»We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although the close victory in the regional elections of last December, Catalan parties who support independence are difficult to maintain this year's initiative, as there are many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and later declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year's elections.
"A candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression we have seen with the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested by Men Who Run Into The House By Car · Global Voices
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested for repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 19.30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to fire a crossbow against the car.
With Menga's score, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingstone guaranteed victory
It was not until his second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox Club that Livingston was shocked by the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's shot took care of the difference, as Gary Holt's team got even with the Hibernian team in second place.
The Gerrard team thus lost its victory in this year's championship, and the next week the Hearts, which leads on the scale, are behind them by eight points.
Earlier, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased its series of incompetences in the six-game division and coach-in-chief Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston wastes his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should've led quite a while before the hit, because with their directness, Rangers caused a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson made it through, but he sent the ball over the door frame, and then Alan Lithgow hit the door, and Craig Halkett shot him over the head.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for the guests when they stopped the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up an action for Mengai, who shot and shot from the middle of the crime scene.
The Rangers had bigger possessions of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't break through, and the doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos blackmailed Kelly's defense.
The Rangers' doorman Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot from his leg, and Lithgow fired another of Livingston's breaks in the attack.
The templates continued to come to Livingstone's penitentiary, but the domestics refused all attacks, and two offenses — Halkett's offense over Glenn Middleton's replacement and the hand-to-hand offense — were not ruled by the judge.
“Excellent performance” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingstone.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed their expectations on this way up.
The style of the game and the law haven't changed much since their return to the top, but Holt needs to be credited for the way he woke the team since his arrival.
It was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role, and he well deployed an excellently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell on guard all the time.
But the Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Even though Gerard’s leadership is remarkable, they are very short of these standards.
There were few shots on the goal – only once they successfully defeated the defence of the hosts — and this is some kind of wake for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
He then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a giant new museum.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the 25,000 heads prevented the crowd from gathering before the Mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
The opinion was also expressed by hundreds of protesters – many Kurds – who do not support Erdogan's government and condemn Erdogan's policy and decision by the German government to welcome him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect separation over a visitor some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others despise as an autocratic.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist was killed in a car crash
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southeastern town at approximately 10:15 p.m. after British summer time.
The driver stopped and the ambulances came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident took place only a few months after the cyclist died in a collision where the car driver escaped, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man so they can notify the family.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted bus lines and advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six guards injured in the accident
Six prison guards were injured in an accident in a top-security man's prison, received word from the prison administration.
The riot broke out at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9:30 after British summer time and is still going on.
Police officers from the “Tornado” unit were called to take care of an incident involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A representative of the prison staff said: "We have called on specially qualified personnel to take care of the incident in the prison of HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that the police responsible will take it away and may be behind bars even longer."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June reported that the prison manager was in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called the police anti-accident unit in prison to mediate a serious incident in which the staff attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is what will likely happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest of the desert and poses a danger of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Ross is supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be late on Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged well 60 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the national hurricane centre provide for 50 to 100 mm rainfall with individual rainfalls of up to 150 mm on Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, rainfalls of up to 100 mm are expected from 25 to 50 mm.
For areas outside the dangers of sudden floods, hurricane Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as in the southwest it is currently taking a dry period.
“According to the US Dry Tracking Centre, good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Ross first leads to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of the hurricane Sunday morning at the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected to reach the mainland in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday or evening.
The rainfalls in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great danger to floods.
»From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonor we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with a possibility of 250 mm of rainfall,« said the weather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger we expect from the hurricane Ross or its remains is the plentiful rains on the Baja Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the American southwest desert," they said at the National Orcan Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life - threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four under arrest for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 p.m. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area at night, reports police from Avon and Somerset.
The cops are calling anyone who might have caught an event on their cell phone to answer it.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered in the hostility and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and unheard tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered in the hostility and anger” of the democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention on Thursday, with a clear and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford was also testifying to her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that "The Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage".
"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electoral participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really trying to run for office," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, the Republican Party adviser told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims increased
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of the giant waves that were pounding along the coast.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu, where six - meter [6 m] waves hit the shore and carried many to their death and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian accident relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami did not come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, he knocked everything down,” he explained, adding that he traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Paluje.
The aerial photographs published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, folded and destroyed bridges and musks surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a number of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPTT) said in a statement that the energy released in a powerful earthquake is approximately 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho further said, communications are completely cut off and they have no information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pal, but officials say the waves came at the time of the warning.
An amateur video released on social networks shows a man on the upper floor screaming warning people on the street on a approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall hit the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
They couldn't confirm the authenticity of the tape at Reuters.
The earthquakes and tsunamis caused a power outage that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the army has begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Paluje on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. House, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Palo, where employees in the courtyard set up a shelter from the meadows outside their premises, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desolation.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to arrive in Palo.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, overseas funding, stocks and staff assistance are permitted only if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered an accident at the level of the province," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "okay, this is a national accident", we can accept international aid, but there is no such status."
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Paluje, friends and relatives of the missing hold on to the hope that their nearby miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled the boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days, and her mother’s body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian team of sailing parachutes, trained two missing sailing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagija, his students.
“As an age in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel was circulated around the community of sailing paratroopers, he was desperate to send messages in the application WhatsApp to competitors in Paluje, who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook, instead of two blue ones.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26.750 while filling the ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee
After reporting from the NYPD in Newport, the thieves stole $ 26.750 from a security worker named Brink’s who filled an ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was employed, another man “produced to the employees of Brink”s from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to reports, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should call the NYPD in Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name — to Ye.
The change was sent on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: "A creature with the official name Kanye West."
It is also known as the "Ye" album, which was released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano Grande, who cancelled the performance for "personal reasons", said the showmaker.
The word is an abbey to his current professional name, but the West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means “you” (e.g. you),” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means “unity”, I changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
He was named "Puff Daddy", "P. Diddy" or "Dddy", and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without his name and with capital letters.
Mexican president AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians, just as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
At a time when leftist student movements began to operate in Latin America, 300 men were shot and killed at peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and to provide monthly subsidies to students and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal societies.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the resources it spends on research in this area, says the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government predicting the use of artificial intelligence, although the US has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"The duplication of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CBS in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Super force of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house, is the president of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In 1980, Carnegie Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player Othello, and was later CEO of Microsoft Research and Chairman of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous technological competitions by the US government, such as a robotics competition organised by the DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the following visionaries.
Researchers in the US have to work hard to get state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, but it’s the companies,” explained Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the best in recent years from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences is financing people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrower committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of two billion USD.
National Scientific Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million USD per year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians to decide on country name change in referendum
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum whether they would change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia" and thus resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
Governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 % absent as long as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ticket was: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that is worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that came after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote which will be decisive.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission has reported that no irregularities have been reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, delivered their votes for a referendum in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on the amendment of the name of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO will bring a strongly needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his ballot was submitted.
He added that the positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that a referendum would be held between 30 per cent and 43 per cent, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
A second poll conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 per cent of respondents would vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the electoral participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would have been the first more serious blow to the pro-Western government policy to take office last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overplayed Brighton's entire defense and hit
On Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in winning Manchester City by 2-0.
Aguero's 65th minute hit looked ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentineian attacker accepted a show in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defense players and found an open space.
Aguiera was then surrounded by four green players.
He overplayed one defense player and was faster than the others at the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
With his first touch in the penitentiary, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's doorman, Matthew Ryan, with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is dealing with leg problems," City Pep Guardiol coach told reporters.
«We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But Sterling was the one who gave blue men the initial advantage in the first English league match.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton's half.
The ball on the left gave Leroy Sane a nice hand.
Sane touched the ball several times, and then he sent the ball to Sterling against the remote door.
A blue-blue gunman shoved the ball into the net just before it went off naked.
The city will meet Hoffenheim in Germany at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their title options
The Nationals team dropped out of the finals, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competing Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the chance to play in the finals, since in the West League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
On Friday, the Rockies won 5:2 above the Nationals team provided the least invitation to the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although there is nothing we can gain, at least we will be able to play in an excellent atmosphere before the great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?"
They haven't published the names of the first metalman for Sunday yet, but in this case, it's likely to be a metal Sherzer.
Sherzer, who will be the first metal of the 34th century, is on Thursday metal as a relieving player and would have had enough rest days by Sunday.
This season, the Washington right-wing man gathered 18 wins and 7 losses with an average of 2.53 and 300 outages in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The President touched on the situation directly regarding his election as Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the mid-term elections.
»Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
These will be one of the biggest – I am really trying with the candidacy, so I am fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible, terriblely radical group of Democrats and this is happening now.
They are determined to regain power, using every means possible. You can see shame, malice.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to go after to gain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and impediment".
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said and identified the Democrats as “angry, evil, lowly and lying”.
By name, he pointed out to a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. It was really a bad body rumor, the worst I've ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
Those who express their opinion are impatient.
When an activist of the Momentum organization told me in my local client, it wasn't even a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of members of Parliament from the Labour Party, which are not wanted to express my opinion.
My colleague Member, Joan Ryan, happened similarly because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was about a proposal of a mistrust for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Within eight years, as long as I am a member of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Today, most meetings do not, unfortunately, use such tone and promise of a "friendly and gentler" policy for a long time if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly obvious that the different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and each opinion assesses whether this is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, whom I previously thought we shared similar political views, expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would never agree with — whether it be in the area of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, condemn middle policy and tell me that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I make are purely political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who face the flood of sexist or racist insults daily, but do not let themselves be afraid.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become something quite common.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin explained that the labor party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of a non-confident or a change of rules for the selection of customers is becoming more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to put my head down and not be so loud, and I will be “all right”.
But I didn't go into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago — the cause of this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, making the classroom literally collapsed in my primary school — I have tried to advocate better public services for those who need it most.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused about my political views and areas I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is sailing against Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of election or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unbeated Ayr to the top of the scale
Two known experiments have slightly distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderful game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the ladder, and they're the only unbeatable team out of ten.
In the end, the scale on the home page overcame their superior defense and better exploiting opportunities and coach Peter Murchie had good reason for satisfaction.
»In our previous matches we have passed many tests and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy,’ he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to the Ayra team, opportunities have been used better than we have."
The hit by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received him in the game with Warriors, meant a number of strengths for the Melroses and Jason Baggott intercepted an attempt without conversion.
At the time of the violation, Climo increased the lead for Ayr before he won at halftime and then turned his own attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at the time of the break.
But Melrose got a very good start on the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggot down to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which they carried on the stretchers, and after that Ayr progressed with the attempt by Stafford McDowall, which he converted to Climo.
The temporary captain of Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose re-exploited the game with the player more with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the violent pressure period.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card due to the obstruction of the Clima without a ball, MacPherson scored in the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent a winged actor named Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt at host.
Stil Game series star starts a new hospitality career
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is apparently being given to catering, as it is expected to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
Two of them announced that after the coming season of the ninth, Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the director.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
»The sea is ours«: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the blue flags of the sea are embroidered.
Sea bases from Lake Titicak to Amazon are covered with slogan: »We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to repay it."
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as is the longing for a return to the Pacific.
This hope may now be the highest after decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court, which it will receive on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the international court on big screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that – after decades of volatile talks – Chile must negotiate the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Here is Morales, Bolivian charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has high expectations for Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia’s benefit — and even if it did, much would not change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to assign Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken for Bolivia, but they might cost her a lot.
"The current Bolivian government took advantage of the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric sucked out of Chilens all the goodwill that might have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the debates.
The state has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken a strangely fast decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending the end of 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea has stated that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a talk at the United Nations General Assembly.
The United States invited them to keep their promises at the meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo was apparently ahead of the restart of nuclear diplomacy at a dead end for more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the United States is wrong if they think the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the announcement of the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
D.C. is careful to secure the forecast without the first adoption of decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the failure of the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
On fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest line of huge covers that come to the shop with affordable brands in your vicinity
If you want to complete your collection of covers or hide completely from the sun, you do not have to look forward.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne in their spring and summer collections 2019 on the fashion runway revealed a collection of strange overcoats that blinded the style of the Paris fashion week.
Very impractical blankets flooded Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular creations to a fashion runway.
Valentine’s piece, which stood out most, was a beige hat with wide shorts decorated with feathers similar to those in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a witch’s hat, and even pineapples — but your head will not be warmed.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks — just the right time for Halloween.
Many colourful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter's masks than high fashions.
One creation was similar to breathing equipment and glasses, and the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashionful acquaintances predict that giant blankets will come to the store near you.
The broad hats are closely followed by “La Bombi”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter shorts was observed at Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among other things.
The cult brand for extremely impractical hats, which flooded social networks, sent another large design along the fashion runway — a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit she wore.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, bordered with lysine bars and white leather handle, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection of Jacqeumus for spring/spring 2019 at the Paris week.
Celebrity Stilist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the store for next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the requirement for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is key for global citizens
The Scots independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results on exams that are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS, aim to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
The independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career and the city they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable elective subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation is impressed with his memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, the words are written in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results show that the languages at the top of the scale with the highest performance rates in independent schools.
68 percent of students learning a foreign language have achieved an excellent assessment.
Data collected in 74 schools of members of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students reached an excellent assessment in Mandarin, and an excellent rating was received by 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that for reasons why employers are struggling to fill their job openings, 17 percent can be attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
In future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great privilege in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouGov survey, which covered more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak foreign language well enough to be able to talk, with French being the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools vary in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, many languages learned by experts in this field will always be selected in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country and therefore this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “International communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.

LeBron will debut Sunday in the Lakers uniform in San Diego
For fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, waiting will soon be over.
The coach of the Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton explained on the official Lakers team website.
The official reporter for Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
"I don't need a pre-season match at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of conventions in his campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled conventions in the following week, including stations in it-loving countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are threatened with losing Congress's control after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s convention in West Virginia be held, and where will it be possible to see it online?
The Trump convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 19.00 p.m. Eastern time.
Trump convention in West Virginia can be seen live online on YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to be talking about hearings of a candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court this week, who have become tense over charges of sexual misconduct, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be delayed for one week to be investigated by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to gain a new momentum.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five conventions aimed to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“The control in Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult campaign season," the campaign representative, who does not want to be appointed, told Reuters.
According to West Virginia MetroNews, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s convention, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 per cent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public opinion research.
"For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president must come and "lift him" in public opinion research," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, reportedly told Reuters.
Ryder's Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday's individual duels
After three one - sided games, it may have been the Saturday afternoon duels of two (foursomes) that this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating fluctuation is a fully fictional sports concept, but the players truly believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the fluke now?
"They had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so this is probably a new momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of leading by four points, and 12 more can get them.
But Americans, according to Spieth’s words, feel that they have wind in their sails, and among other things, they were encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was destined from the initial blow to the greenery and set a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to grow louder and lead to a decisive blow when Thomas and his two-point backs were evened out in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory on the 15th hole accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just need to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder's Cup.
An unusual but charming two Europeans have won four points out of four and are infallible.
The two "Moliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit a bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy between them and the noisy audience seems to flow is confirmed by the fact that they are those players who will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal the possible victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
But preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergia Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noren.
Because of the bugs and the two double bugs on the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis that they could not find their way out of.
But Saturday, the players won't have any help.
The four-ball games and the duels of two two are an exception to be monitored closely because of the communication between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give each other, and the way in which the strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of two two have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, particularly on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe is going to the final day of Ryder's Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's games with four balls and the duels of two two leading 10-6 against the United States.
The excellent couple, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, made their best efforts and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at the Le Golf National field sold four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who strives to win the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltin, had the power over the wrong American team in the morning games with four balls, leading in a series of 3-1.
The U.S. team fought better in two-two fights, where they won two games, but they couldn't catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the couple called "Mollywood") after the sensational end of the week only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder's Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they re-emerged and even more convincingly defeated spent Woods and American recruit Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at moments, but lost 19 out of 29 games in a match with four balls and a duel of two doubles, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duels of two twins and in pairs with Henry Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not all went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they firmly won against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later came back and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in a two-two duel, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of Ryder's Cup did the team return after four points behind the individual duels, although Fury's team only needs an equalization to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, Sunday’s counter-attack may seem too big for it.
North Korea: "We will not be unilaterally disarmed without confidence"
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions has resulted in increasing mistrust in the United States of America and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Body, Ri Yong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has taken a number of "important measures in a sign of goodwill" such as stopping the implementation of nuclear and missile experiments, subsidising the city for nuclear experiments and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"We will not be convinced of national security without confidence in the US and under such conditions we will not be unilaterally first disarmed."
While Ri repeated known complaints from North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea would have been rewarded for the adoption of gradual measures, his statement was important because he did not immediately refuse unilateral nuclear disarmament, as in the past, as inPjongyang.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that the first thing is to give up the nuclear weapon.
Washington also did not yield to calls for the release of strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The US insists that we first disarm ourselves with nuclear disarmament and step up pressure with sanctions in order to achieve its objectives by force, and even object to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The thought that sanctions could bring us to our knees is the unrealistic hope of people who don’t even know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued implementation of sanctions further deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jae Ino, who took place over the past five months, and added: "If we had talked about the problem of nuclear disarmament with South Korea and not the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have agreed to such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Rie's speech was quite different from that of last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the attack on the U.S. continental part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump Kim was designated "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage to take disarmament measures at the United Nations Assembly, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said that there was no timeframe for this, saying: "It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue decisively without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent funding of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he declared that progress had been made, and North Korea had been criticising him for several hours, if his demands were to be "gangsteric".
In a meeting with Mun during this month, North Korea committed itself to subdue the missile testing station and the nuclear experiment infrastructure if the United States takes "adequate measures".
Kim was supposed to say that the "appropriate measures" meant the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year's Harvard University course is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course they want to fight the growing macho culture of “all-night” learning, where they gain their strength with caffeine.
The university professor found that the world's best university students often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that was his first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
After the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said, "Why do I only know this now that I'm in my last year?"
She said no one's ever told her how important sleep is.
This year's first course discusses the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says that they decided on such a course when they found out that the student was largely short of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door of the student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term lack of sleep may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of a student village with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that student behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to learn about these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with the “experienced all-night learning” and adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, pose a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that sufficient quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brain, because of lack of sleep, becomes hungry, which is why students are constantly hungry.
19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler shape his course. During his first year at Harvard he attended one of the professor's lectures.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student community.
He hopes that in the next phase he can ask the graduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up a sleeping alarm as well as a awakening. He also wants to draw them to the harmful effects of the “Blue Light”, which is broadcast by electronic screens and LEDs, as they can cause an imbalance of the Circadia rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit immersed by Gerard's team
Rangers again defeated by guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston, the declared team of Steven Gerrard to be defeated by 1 :0.
The team from Ibrox was hunting for its first guest victory after the February overlordship at St. Johnston Stadium by 4 :1, but Gary Holt's team scored a second defeat in 18 matches since Gerrard led by his team for the leading team of the Scottish League 8 points behind.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half ran out, and the chosen kind of Rangers didn't give the impression that he wanted to even it out.
With this, Rangers fell into a common place, and Livingston made third, but with the difference of goals, the Hibernian team was left behind.
The Rangers' problems were not over yet. Calum Spence, a by-judge, suffered head injury when he was reportedly approached by an object from the town of guest group fans.
Gerrard performed eight shifts on the crew, which had no problem defeating Ayr and taking part in the batfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified elevens of Livingstone, who had previously taken away the Hearts team's point, and no doubt was thrilled with how his escaped team effectively neutralized all attempts by guests.
Although the Rangers had higher possessions of the ball, Livingstone made better use of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with his first short story, and then he went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but he was a connective performer and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot by Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after the collision with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match, a criminal shooting was to be ordered, but Judge Steven Thomson pushed the Colombian's demands into a potassium.
The Rangers were first able to put together only two shots on the goal, but not a head shot sent against the goal by Lassano Coulibaly, nor the loose ball of Ovie Ejari, were no dangers for the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he had already been fully earned because of endurance.
The Rangers failed to cash out another Jacobs extension with a long shot.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Menga's floor for the simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly during his vacation with a winged actor, Ryan Kent, who immediately showed up with Morlos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett took care of several courses before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead against the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inextricably inextricable.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the chance to shoot after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't admit him.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
We represent the Almanac page of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, so on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-renowned physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for developing a device called Geiger's counter.
He became permanent in the scientific world, and he also won his city in pop culture, for example in the film "Bells of Coronado", 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: »This is Geiger's counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of radioactiveity on atoms in materials.”
Evans: "Madonca, they're really talking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before 63rd birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and destroy attack cells
As part of therapy, the vaccine learns the immune system to identify the attack cells
This method includes the production of immune cells of the patient then modified in the laboratory
After this, the “see” protein, which is characteristic of a number of forms of cancer, can then be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very stimulating in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify attack cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the production of immune cells of the patient, which are modified in the laboratory, so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of a number of forms of cancer, and then re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Research Institute from Bethlehem, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several different types of cancer” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach to the production of immune cells of patients who are “teached” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
After performing at SNL, Kanye West performed a prothromping point with a sign of MAGA on its hat.
Publicity Was Not Excited
He also played in the studio of Saturday Night Live at a strange point, during which he expressed his support for American President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the presidential chair.
After the end of the performance with the third song of his performance, called "Gost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Against", West began the attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump because he is a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved away from America long ago,” he says.
This SNL broadcast began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player went crazy from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but it was uploaded to social networks by the comic Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of the West.
The West also complained to the audience that he had some problems in the back because of the inscription on his hat.
»They came after me after the stage.
They said, “Don’t get on the stage with this hat”.
I've been harassed!
And they say I am lost," he said after Washington Examiner's report.
The West continued: “You want to see the lost scene?” and added that it must put on “Superman’s cloak because this means that no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were at least twice prepared by the audience to whistle and members of the SNL team were obviously embarrassed and someone also said about Vanity: “There was death silence in the studio.”
At the last minute, a goat was invited to replace Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The song "I Love it" was written by the song "I Love it", which included the costume of a bottle of mineral water brand Perrier.
Wesa was supported by Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for having resisted Paradise.”
But Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply "what it is, and that's just fine.
However, I will not reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art"), who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads the ideology which is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, rapper tweeted that he had changed his name and from now on will be "a being formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE."
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, and before him he's already done it, Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: The Prince changed his name to a symbol, then he was an artist, once known as Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police say the event took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant must vote before the court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harrington starred sharply against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his sword swing as Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero says that because of the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that respect can only be earned by hardness.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that something had gone wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #JATI movement.
The player, who recently married a 31-year-old teammate from the Rose Leslie Game of Thrones, admitted that he had strong convictions about this subject.
"I am currently seriously asking myself where we made the mistake when it came to manhood," he said.
“What did we teach men in our adulthood about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood by showing very manly characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel like they have to choose this particular side of manhood?
I think it's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change that?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer he will not participate in the shooting of any prehistory or continuation of the Game of Thrones, because he “closed with battlefields and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the lead role of the new concert of True West Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose, on the set.
“I met my wife because of this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love selection of the whale character Jon Snow in a fantasy show awarded with Emma.
The couple married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases reported in China
China reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual relations, a change compared to the past.
The HIV virus has usually spread rapidly in some parts of China due to a blood transfusion.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in this way decreased to almost zero from the Junan conference in the province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing annually by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV to sexual relations in the Chinese community of LGBT is a very pressing problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT-community remains high.
As conservative values continue to apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of its efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff issued data on Republican senators condemning "hazardous lies" and "the conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US congresswoman Maxine Waters refused to press charges that a member of her staff published data on three US Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The L.A. Democrats claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites of the far right.
"Lying, lying and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
These data appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment of the candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Canaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators finished questioning Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, indicate that the IP can identify the source of publication that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information has been published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and a pure lie” continues Waters.
»My employees whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations are not responsible for the leak of this data.
These unfounded accusations are a completely untrue and pure lie.”
Senator Waters' statement came across criticisms on the Internet, including by former White House representative for the press, Ari Fleischer.
"From this denial of the branch of anger", he wrote.
"This may mean that it is not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he can't question the motive of the defendant.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's democratic criticism that he was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for the city of Waters during the mid-term elections, contacted Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious”, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet had informed “the appropriate institutions and law enforcement authorities about these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for clues to Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the resuscitation of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003, titled Johnny English and continued in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satire about how shitty we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes raised and unusual faces, gets permission to remix the skewers; his name indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean, and a small detail of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on a traveller and an international mystery man played by Atkinson once in a now forgotten TV commercial for Barclay, leaving behind real chaos.
Although one or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in the helicopter, he was wearing medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were short - lived by his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly presented, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission impossible now without bad conscience offer comical elements.
It seems that humor is intended for children and not so many adult viewers, which is why Johnny English's renunciated occasions are not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's mute sketches as Mr Bean.
The constant theme is now evident that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the web network of British most secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent, who is in a surprisingly small role represented by Kevin Eldon.
This is the point of the break for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure that has already suffered a break because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has made an effort with the role of alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the scenario to help herself.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies have been exposed, so she has to choose one of the retired spies.
And this means Johnny Englisha, now a teacher at a distinguished school who informally teaches how to act undercover: here are the writers, as English performs some kind of spy “academia of rock”.
They take Englisha to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where she meets a longtime associate named Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotype sportswoman, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is lost a little bit.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems in the name of the Secret Service of Her Majesty, while meeting Fatalko Ophelio Bulleto, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey: dressed as waiters set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when they smuggle on the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for an apparent reality to get acquainted with the interior of Walt's house, it manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite its sympathy and energy, it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English movies, I can't help myself here, and I think, "Is British Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?"
Labourists deny that they plan a four-day working week for the British and would receive a five-day work week payment.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyna is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five - day payment.
The company's manager wants the savings created by companies due to the artificial intelligence revolution to be spent on workers and to be given an additional day off.
So the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the client's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve through the customer's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the client."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea as the four-week working week in its campaign in the general elections in 2017 supported the Green Party.
However, this objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour party representative said: "The four-week working week is not a party policy and the client is not thinking about it."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to rip out the power of "indifferent directors" and "winners" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current stakeholders in the water companies may not regain their full share, as the labor party could introduce “deductions” on the basis of alleged injustices.
It also confirmed plans for the inclusion of workers in the boards of directors and the introduction of the Own-Inclusion Funds, which would transfer 10% of the share in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh conducted by the FBI.
An investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was transmitted on Sunday, the correspondent of the show “60 Minutes” of Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could discover anything that would make it possible for her to change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I think, of course,” said Kennedy.
»I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, “Did you do it”?”
He was determined, unambiguous, unequivocal.”
And Graham's voice appears to be carved into stone.
"I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason to change it," he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
»And none of those she named could confirm this
It's a 36-year-old case.
I do not see any new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event featuring a truly remarkable series of stars and having the same exceptional mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place seven times, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Great grass of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens' Project, an international defence group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of poverty elimination.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them that they need action, or is this just another example of what is called "clitivism" – the creation of the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or the intervention of tweets?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011 more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters have been recorded in their efforts for a range of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to make commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion, which is expected to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that the fruit of its actions was to be 390 commitments and communications on which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the power of nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to helping children realize their full potential), which Rwanda promised USD 35 million to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as yourself, we can bring social injustice of malnutrition to historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Food Power Partnership, to the crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out that the United Kingdom has called for improvements in the diet of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will co-finance the Food Power Project, which will reach 5 million women and children through food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
The Global Citizens movement replied: "This will be a long and hard path – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year's event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the U.S. Navy as a "block" of Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner newspaper, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East, “if necessary”.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that the invitation of legal governments) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," it is said.
According to the official, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can deal with this. The Navy shall ensure that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, so as to prevent Russian energy from running into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group addressed as the "vote of Energy Consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence and replace fuels," he said, marking Russia "a pony that knows one trick", with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration seeks to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is expected to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is why, according to Trump Berlin, is supposed to be “a hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is supposed to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is about unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the same view that energy must not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Union of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The involvement of a third country in our energy supply means a big problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly consider" her candidacy in the US Presidential elections in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "examination" her candidacy for the US president after the interim elections.
At the town house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, as required by the female leader," The Hill reported.
"After 6 November, I will examine my candidacy for the president carefully."
During the meeting at the city hall, Warren was challenging President Donald Trump, as "this country is supposed to lead in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly," she said.
Warren’s reputation as President of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh has often been openly criticized by Trump and the candidate for Supreme Court.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course before the elections we need an FBI investigation."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not apply for the position of president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Centre / Boston Globe, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that it has greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high-ranking Democrats in the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder at the meeting to support Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son is going through, what he is experiencing after his return, connects me with other families who are coping with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain amount of wound that our soldiers are returning to," he told the audience at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's arrest was marked "the elephant in the salon" and said that her son and other war veterans are returning slightly modified, hardened, wondering where the respect for what the fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the army donated to the state was.
Barack Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstructions to report violence in the family and possession of weapons in a wined state, said Dan Bennett, representative of the police station in Wasilla.
18 States and the District of Colombia support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of a new American policy that gives up the right to asylum for victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district mentioned on Friday filled the court lobby to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the defendant in Grace's suit against the Sessions, which was filed by the US Civil Liberties Association against Federal Policy, has not been published.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the gang", had abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
State prosecutors in the federal states who support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum applications in the United States come, as countries that are constantly coping with problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new asylum policy of the United States repealed the decision of the Immigrant Call Committee, which allowed unrecorded immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Prosecutor of Columbia County General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy " despises decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” states the court’s application.
State prosecutors further stated in the request that the policy denying immigrants the right to enter is damaging the US economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and are "ensuring the necessary labour force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership in each social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother of Ris Kusum when she comforted her hot boyfriend at the evacuation center in the ruined town of Pal.
"The lifeguards are constantly bringing the bodies.
There is no clean water."
It seemed to be the locals returning to the destroyed homes, who were breaking through overpowered things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, rested outside a military hospital in Paluje, where patients were treated in the open air for persistently severe earthquakes.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think it squeezed me against the ruins of the walls," Harris told Associated Press. He added that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
“I heard the woman calling for help and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses Chinese "troubles" with "propaganda ads"
One week after the publication of a four-sided ad of the official Chinese newspaper in the American diary, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuses of the American press of spreading propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned the paid addition of Chinese Daily in the newspaper Des Moines, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa last Sunday, after he accused China of involvement in the US congress elections on November 6th, which China denied.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials have described Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with the U.S. federal elections as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense efforts to press China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish commercial advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently complex in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange punches by introducing customs on imported products.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war are expected to affect exporters in the federal countries, such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to the Chinese and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column on Sunday's edition of Officer Des Moines Register, "now doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish the paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see few other opinions on the stand with newspapers in Beijing, and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic pathway, since the China Communist Party is strictly controlled,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer for publication" of his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose voters before mid-term elections by breaking up with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts note that the support of many of the most important Republicans, who support and defend the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court, despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming interim elections by losing their ballots.
The feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue with the vote.
This cannot be restored," said Grant Reeher, professor of politology at Maxwell University of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to appease the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget this either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn, on Friday, after reporting from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the Senate when Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford reported the news portal Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will exceed all borders," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst told reporters.
"People say they are already strong, and that is true.
However, it could be even stronger, especially among undefined voters in suburban and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, but do not often vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her accusations of sexual assault by a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further republican support could have negative consequences.
“This became a big mix-up for the GOP,” according to NBC News at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, said.
“It’s not just the vote of the Council or the final vote or Kavanaugh oath; it’s also the way Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities Group USA, who supports Democrats in the elections.
But the Americans seem slightly divided between whether they believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more support for the latter.
The new YouG survey shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh for sure or best.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh was likely or certain to lie, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flakea FBA, he is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reports Officer The Guardian.
Last week in front of the Senate court council, Ford's sworn testimony was that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her in a wined state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were at the party together during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the world's internet plans to start a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is opening a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is the company that is building on the Berners Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to "rule the world".
"We have decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create a "personal data storage store" or POD
This may include contact details, list of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to being Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
The company calls this "personal data empowerment".
Executive Director John Bruce says it is the idea of the company to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform to anyone.
At present, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers for work on the project and the volunteer developers community.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether we could introduce a perfect change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's aim is to "provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new internet built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet by setting up a World Wide Web Consortium consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next time of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Holiday of the bearer of Victoria’s Cross from World War I
For over 100 years, they have celebrated the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the English Church, who gained it as a fighter in World War I.
On September 29, 1918, Reverend Colonel Bernard Vann earned his confession in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of Colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s work to earn his medal.
After reporting from Officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel of St. Quintine "through a very dense fog and under the strong fire of the battlefield and machine guns."
Later, he set out against the shooting line and led the line forward with the "maximum heroism" and then attacked the machinery room himself and struck three members of the squad.
On 4 October 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper just a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so he taught me humility.”
With your brother, Dr. James Vann, you also laid a wreath after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade," and "that the courage of the true hero is reflected in the support that many people will say."
The fans of mixed martial arts were up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, the Pepe Pigs were given instead.
Imagine: You were up all night to watch the completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 duels, including six in the main parking lot, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to make a stand, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed to find that the transmission had been replaced by the playback of the cartoon Puis Pepe.
Many were not thrilled because he remained awake until morning because of the duel.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6am, so they had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pussa Peppa." Yeah.
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule to include future viewers in the UK.
“When I think about playing it again, I think we could arrange it,” said Coker.
"But then there is the sixth hour of the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged during the switchover and not everyone was nice.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed it was only a technical mistake.
However, the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five fights — as usual. We have tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we have counted ourselves.
This is a very ungrateful situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "necessary" about sex.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation he felt less valuable than anyone — but this gave him motivation for success.
A 24-year-old said that “not everyone like himself was aware of it when he entered high school.
During the first talk on Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said that he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympic Games decreased.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months because of her illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to have boyfriends and girlfriends."
He said: "To date, these feelings of inferiority and differentity are the real thing that gives me strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “something”, he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know about his orientation.
Twice the bronze Olympic contestant has become an influential advocate of LGBT-justices and has appeared twice this year at the National Games in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope. ”
Three times the world champion said that romance with a man – American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 – “surprised him.”
Daley married a 20 - year - old Oscar winner last year, but he says the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so many young people” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic Games and three years later his father died – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple adopted a child, Robert Black-Dalley's son, and Daley says that his "total view" changed.
“If I were asked last year, all I would have to say would be that “I have to achieve a gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley’s father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't say to him, "This time you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead was I finally had to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and scored a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympic Games in front of the domestic audience. There was no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by his first selection of songs – The Study of Musicians Heather Small, who accompanied him when preparing for the Olympic Games and with which he still had a hard-on for his skin.
The Desert Island Discs show is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson is the Saturday Ryder Cup precedent
On Sunday, when American Phil Mickelson plays his 47th in the Ryder Cup, he's gonna set a record, but he's gonna have to come back into shape again so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
On the 12th record, Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event, left Captain Furyk sitting on Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the centre of what was so common for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day in part as a fan and in part to improve his game in order to fix what he is struggling with.
Given that even at the height of his career he did not measure the most straight, a 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow Le Golf National course, where the long ledge inevitably punishes the wrong blows.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, Mickelson on the ninth game of the week will be dealing with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Cup, who, in a leap to win all four games this week, connected himself with a rookie named Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals had four games less, had a good start, Mickelson's game could have proved decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, patted me on the back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"She has a lot of confidence in herself.
He is one of the famous and has made a remarkable contribution to the teams in the past and this week.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we felt that this is what has to be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the highest number of matches played in the Ryder Cup Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's cup career, which never really coincided with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equalizations, but Furyk said that his presence on the team also brings some inconclusive benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and he’s great to have him in a team space,” he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they measured with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage can soon be unearthed
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can easily turn into an unpleasant ride at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals at Ryder's Cup.
In 1997, the young Dane debuted at a match in Valderrama, where the side of which Seva Ballesteros was captain had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the goal she made it with an advantage of only hair, with a result of 14°-13°.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (in the picture) after a tour of the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led to the Le Golf National field by 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the cup isn't over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
The game isn't over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on it.
All the time it says that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is standing on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Excited by the game of his players on the demanding field, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
There'll be a game of individuals at the top tomorrow, so we'll have to deal with it differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, your golfers' abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to deliver to the players: tomorrow you must get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the revolutions in the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he answered, asking him how Bencrenshaw, captain of 1999, took his players to the last day of the match.
»We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as fast as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gets tensile, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We created a proper setup and put the boys in a way, until we felt that tomorrow we would do something magical.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to fight the battle and fighting Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys I decided on this order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
New German warship rescinded
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be dedicated to use in 2014 in order to replace the ageing warship from the Cold War, but due to the failure of systems and fast-growing costs, local municipalities reported.
The handover of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the new class of frigate Baden-Wuertemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, says the officer Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but an ambitious project raises concerns after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen class frigate.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals — the latest frigates could remain outside the port of home for up to two years.
However, continuous delays mean that the top warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence the overseas power, will become obsolete by the time the application begins, according to the daily Die Ziet.
Last year, the unfortunate frigate F125 appeared on the cover when the German Navy officially rejected the takeover of the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
The reasons for the return are known only for few reasons, and the German municipalities have listed a number of key "programme and technical deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if it were directed to a combat mission.
The shortcomings in software were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older Bremen frigates.
It has also proved that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the possibilities of the Navy for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is supposed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — has become a problem.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is in fact "missing ships suitable for deployment".
The official said that the issue has been tightened over time because the old ships have been decommissioned and the replacement vessels have not been provided.
He regretted that no ship from the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret lives of bats
A new study is being carried out at a property in Scotland, which aims to discover how bats use food in hunting food.
They hope that the results will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will be accompanied by small bats and small bats and brown eardrums bats and longline bats on the Inverewa Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
In key places, special camera recorders will be installed to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The professional sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what kinds of things they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of bat forests and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has dropped sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk also represents wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies and some types of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks on cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they help each other more with their ears than with their eyes.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to determine accurately the errors and obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, shelter checks and occasional resolutions.
The organization established even the first and so far the only Scottish reserve specially designed for bats in the Triava area of Dumfries and Galloway.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
»We have an excellent area for bats at Threav,’ he said.
»We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, bats are still well-known, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance works on holdings, since the possible accidental destruction of a single bat hospital could result in the death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and we simply don't know how well their population is being held."
Ronaldo refuses rape charges and lawyers prepare to press charges against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the rape charges he was about to commit as “false news” and said that people want to “promise themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to press charges against the German magazine with the news of Derbach, who published the charges.
In 2009, he raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Derbach reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 for the silence of the event.
In an address of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as “false news”
»No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," the Golden Ball winner said in a camera five times.
"By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I am a happy man and I wish everyone well," the smiling actor added.
Ronald's lawyers, according to Reuters, are preparing for the suit of Derhead magazine for the accusations they called "unacceptable reporting on the suspicions of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "non-problem damage to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at the Mayorga nightclub with Ronald, she was to return to the player's room, where she was to be raped anally.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after that event and said that he was a “99% good man”, who was disappointed only in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she was going to the police and that the hospital had taken photos of her injuries, and later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “awesomely afraid of revenge” and was worried about“public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement, as the alleged event continues to cause severe trauma.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, according to an agreement worth $100 million, moved to Italy’s great Yuventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom “would be sorry forever” for the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would be sorry forever" if the world's leading car manufacturer had lost their status after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "certainly" that Toyota UK said for BBC that the exit of Great Britain from the EU would have temporarily stopped production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of Brexit could, without agreement, lead to loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Auris and Avensis Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, production at our factory would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at the Burnaston factory.
The concerns about how the exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade without agreement have been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that it would close its Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of Brexit.
Toyotina’s production line operates according to the principle of “at the right time”, with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU coming to cars every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could lead to disturbances at the borders which industry representatives say could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire could not be stored for more than one day of parts, company representatives said, and production would therefore be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Therese May’s plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly moderated to avoid such border checks".
»We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity«, he said for Today BBC Radio 4.
"Data not only Toyota, but also other producers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain set."
Toyota was unable to comment on how long production would have been stopped, but it noted in the long run that the additional costs would have reduced the competitiveness of the factory and finally led to job losses.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be moved again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed by the ongoing struggle over the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "for another week", the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian pre-election interference, links between Trump's associates and Russia and the potential president's impediment to the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general and threaten Mueller's independence has been feeding Washington's rumors for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a listening device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, in the midst of reports of his intention to step down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then declared Thursday at the United Nations Conference in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein "would rather not" be fired, and then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-day investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News show Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could have happened this week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, but could have been postponed for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure you are informed.”
Some reporters would object to this, and Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of meetings cannot be attributed to the resistance to the "set-up" of TV reporters, but she said: "I could not deny that they are being set up."
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has carried out more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding without reference to the source: "We have looked at each other's numbers."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn directly to the President of the United States with their question, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
This is what we are trying to do as much as possible, and you have seen that we have done this a lot in the last few weeks and that you will have at your disposal a conference at which you will be able to speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared bizarrely and in part in front of the collected journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to the NHS Scotland on the fears related to Brexite
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working on the Scots NHS to express their gratitude for the country and their desire to continue the work on its own.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applications for the regulation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on exit, as decisions were drawn up this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of its nationality.
Friends from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated upon head injury
Following a head injury in Saturday's defeat with 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, Mike Organ of the newspaper The Tennessee reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred only a short time ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there,” said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff provided Abercrombie at the edge of the field with oxygen before they laid him on a stretcher and carried him off the field for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the details of the type/range of injury are not yet known" and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since the transfer from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he took five blows before leaving the game, which raised his total number of hits in the season to 18 blows.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
A higher fee will be charged to foreign customers when buying property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new tories plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increased amount will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasurer expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher rate of tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will be allocated to the homeless will be delivered today by Theresa May.
The move should be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure affordable housing and to increase the taxation of people with high incomes.
The increased amount will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and additional money will encourage government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The premium – which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for broadcasting – could be no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to collect up to GBP 120 million a year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-citizens of the United Kingdom are expected to purchase 13% of newly built London properties, resulting in price increases and a harder purchase of the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "ghost cities", as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The large construction companies have been accused of price increases by taking up land that they are not actually using, and Mrs Mayevo has called on Mrs Mayevo to abandon quotas for affordable housing to repair British "dwelling shame".
Mr Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the completion of forced evictions without fault.
In addition, it aims to give city councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministerial leadership to restoring British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means correcting our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy a home as it is for the garnery British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage the Scotland Club"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the North-East Club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than first-class.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St. Mirren took him back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I received a B cap and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsbound show.
“But I grew up with the frequent observation of Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as heir to such great names, he felt no fear.
“Success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’.”
According to the structure and capacity this club certainly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The way there is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could take it there again."
Ross was only doing the manager's job for three years after being the assistant manager in Dumberton and 15 months of coaching the Hearts.
Alloi then helped prevent the third league outfall and St. Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This was probably a real turning point”, he remembered taking over Alloa.
“I was really convinced that management is the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing well as an actor, so I had a relatively good time, and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be dealt with every week.
With this in terms of stress and pressure at work, I still face it, but management simply feels like the right thing to do for myself.
I always wanted to run the club and I am doing it now. In my whole adult life I feel more comfortable."

Research result: ideal time for beer Saturday at 17.30
Summer heat has increased incomes from hard-to-break British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurant chains has also increased.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA who prepared the data, said: “Sustainable solar time and participation of England in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that in July he followed a similar pattern than in June of the past month, when the income of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, only that the restaurants were affected even more strongly.
The decline in traffic in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June increased further.
The traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased more in comparison than in restaurants.
The sun’s weather also reduced sales in pubs, which offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over one month and the sale of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for leisure and hospitality RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
In the case of sales on the hospitality market, the biggest factors remain time and impact of major social or sports events.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the decline by 4.8 percent at annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of restaurants with food, a long hot summer could not come at a more wrong time, and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of brands.

One in five children has a secret account hidden from their parents on the social network
Research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account hidden from parents and teachers on the social network
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News boosts fears of sexual disclosure
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account for parents
One of the five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - creates an account on social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has strengthened fears about the publication of sexual content related to it.
Twenty percent of the students said they manage a censored “main” account, which they show to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who happened to run into a secret side of a 13-year-old daughter noticed that her daughter was calling on visitors to rape her.
The study conducted by the Digital Aware UK Network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11–18-year-olds have two profiles and half of them acknowledge that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Committee on Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletics Committee as the non-executive Director of the Annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athletes on the ground and outdoors and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are sure that athletics in Scotland would have gained a huge amount of weight by including it in the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help guide sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals at 200 metres and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for BBC, lost his ability to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I was fully recovered, learning to walk again, and today I practice agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
The advert for breast pump comparing mothers with cows distributed online opinions
The company that manufactures the breast pumps has distributed opinions by comparing mothers with cows in milk.
For the start of the marketing of the “first silent portable breast pump”, the company for the consumer technique Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a hay-filled barn, to a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I draw, there is no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my sister’s, these are my tits.”
The collection goes on to say, "Trun out, run out, feed the babies, run out, run out, squeeze the breast."
However, the ad published on Facebook’s website has resulted in considerable disdain on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it is a joke at the expense of the “gross” dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and make babies to produce milk, but they steal their babies from them in the first days after the quotation," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
The second comments: "Of course it is traumatic for both mother and cub.
But why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: "Advertise completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song “to die funny”.
“This seems like a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was drawing, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad is kind of crazy, but I understood it just like it was meant to be.
This is a genius product,” the second one wrote.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are exhausted (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, keep the child and even work outdoors during milk extraction.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, further commented. "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation."
With the draw of a parallel between women who draw milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on drawing milk and all its challenges, and in the fun way that women can relate to each other, we wanted to show an amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first case when the Elvie pump came to the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children walked on the model track for the designer Marta Jakubowski when using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen strongly, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to endanger their own chances of staying in the country by applying for a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to issue fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Agency for Immigration and Customs, testified before the convention that the agency had arrested ten people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to address children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will appear with a videoconferencing call, not in person, to defend themselves before a judge for immigration.
Those who are considered not eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to statements by asylum workers and reports in the system.
The defenders said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornille, where signs of child’s distress are more likely to remain undetected because of their size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without being emotionally prepared or given a chance to say goodbye to their friends could complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even in the country for the eighth year of the war.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will act accordingly".
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he told the assembly.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, "almost finished".
He said that Damascus will continue to "to fight this holy battle until we clean the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who are primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and accused "some Western states" of "expanding unreasonable fears" that convinced the refugees to stay abroad.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They are changing the political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive reconstruction until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from Fronta Nusra, linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be "rooted".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and to push the way to the elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian government for co-operation on the committee, saying that the Committee's work should be limited "to review the members of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach second term
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the 2020 re-election, unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, his presidency ends early in the event of an impeachment and scandal.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency at any time!"
So far, there's no sign of the tiredness of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings have doubled more than to 1.05 million at the time of maximum viewing and MSNBC's ratings are almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of its highest ratings, which, according to Nielsen, was more than four years ago, when it had 1.7 million, and the show "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designated Survivors”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and some hard truths about spying at the Hollywood Boys Club," offers a different explanation.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Schovell told me.
In chaos is fun value.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, a six-hour view of the round table of experts discussing the use of the »deep background« resource for the book “Strembling” by Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of leather jackets (“a dress that is thickly inflated,” said The Washington Post newspaper, and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trumpov, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I will never look at Super Maria again.
“The part of his initiation, which inspires the impression of a reality show, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show “Pown Stars” about the occupation of Trump's show and the daily turns of the script (a duel with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, he was 80 degrees (26,7 °C), but he was confused inside when he was watching MSNBC when he was recording CNN.
He couldn't break away, not even when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
“I remember when we created all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” said Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money is being made ready for the closest mid-term parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that there is a flood of money in the 17th Pennsylvania district, as two candidates found themselves in the race for the same seat because of the refurbishing of congressional districts.
This recently divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in special elections this spring in another district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were drawn new when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge ruled in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally painted for the benefit of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district touched on the struggle to fund campaigns between the main party financial bodies, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broadly monitored March special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania district.
For over a decade, this seat was occupied by the Republican, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to Democrats.
In the United States, sanctions against Salvador were considered for China's support, and they then withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to call off US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "the recent decision to end the recognition of Taiwan" said Heather Nauert, a representative of the ministry, in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions have been considered regarding Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in US aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on the issue of visas, would seriously affect this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials suspended a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, ending their views on the sentences for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of speaking to participants of the conference, which is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the US government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three US envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on the condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on a possible obstacle to the judicial authority, which is already very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also going to point the investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia to attack the American elections.
If the congress changes its hands, Mr Trump will have to speak to the authorities before they do, and even before the jury of his colleagues, he may have to answer just as he prepares to speak to his constituents again.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not want to claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to strike Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, thus missing the opportunity to avoid the year of the slaughter that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history changes and speeds up or inhibits the unforgivable course of democracy.
Americans are dealing with multiple such fractures right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's in the hands of the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this officer reported that last year he proposed a covert recording of the president and speculated on his incompetence for this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report from The Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the requested investigation of FBI Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if it is appointed Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And in particular, will we vote in the interim elections for Congress, which will require Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she told me to light the sabbatical candles on the swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Ranger Graham Dorans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a clear victory over the Austrians after an impressive remission against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month putting them in a convincing position for a G League qualification.
The damage to the knee prevented binding player Graham Dorans from appearing for the first time in the season before the 2-2 remium against Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use it as a bouncer for greater achievements.
“This was a deserved point for us, as Villarreal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
»We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take away the point.
We might end up playing victory, but in general, rema is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
It's gonna be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am confident with the crowd behind us that we can work hard and achieve a positive result.
The last year has undoubtedly been difficult, given everything that's happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor sleep of women because of fear of savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people discussed this with their family members.
Half of the respondents to the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that children talk about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at the Nationwide insurance company.
You can start as follows.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not talk to her about it in time .
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of the transition.
Choose a healthcare professional by determining a trustworthy person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts respect your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also empowering a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.

In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times with an air rifle
One man returning home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot multiple times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which occurred about 2.30 p.m. after British time, as a "random act".
She didn't see the victim of her attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police have called on any witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami, which hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was expected to increase further.
In the event of interrupted communications, rescue workers from the Donggala regentship, the area north of Paluje, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key information on Palu and Donggali in Sulavesia:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesia, a province that lies at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavezi and is estimated to have 379.800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a province that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulavesi.
The registries, the administrative unit below the province, were estimated to have a population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulavez are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, there is also important activity in the mining of nickels, which is mainly carried out in Moravali, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
After reporting from the Indonesian Agency to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggalo have suffered tsunamis several times.
In 1938, tsunamis caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also affected the northern Donggalo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake - active Pacific Ring, and earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis affecting 14 countries that killed 226,000 people along the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes affected Western Sumatro late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of the Magnitude 6,8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused the deaths of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude hit one of the Mentawai islands and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake affected the regency of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami didn't go off, but the fallen buildings caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused more than 500 deaths, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily kept thousands of tourists.
Arresting the eldest son of Sarah Palin for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troppers Police Agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Pala's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone out of her hands.
Palina was detained at Mat-Su Predictive Institute and was detained under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, according to the KTUU television network.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was “indeed innocent”, when he was asked about his defence, the network reported.
The palina has been charged with three Class A offences, which means that it could be closed for up to a year and punished by a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one Class B offence, which is being punished by one day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
Palin's crime wasn't charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in the application of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from the military service in Iraq.
tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulaveza on Friday.
The 7.5-magnetude earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off and the number of fatalities is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake took place right next to central Sullivan, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulated to show the moment of the earthquake.
When tsunamis hit the coast, hundreds of people were held at the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York City are demanding the death penalty for Sayfulle Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City where eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a rental delivery truck to launch an attack on a cycling route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan when he ran over several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, it is recorded in the notice of the request for the death penalty lodged in the South District of New York.
According to a court document, the cause of the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury of Saipov informed the indictment of 22 counts involving eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "substantial planning and intent", said prosecutors, who described Saip's way as "defendant, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullajevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drac, Ariel Erli, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” is recorded in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The County Court for the South District sentenced the last death sentence ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, and finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saip told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he had seen on the phone.
The police also said that they requested the ISIS flag to be decommissioned in their hospital room.
About the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of taking the blame in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all concerned will only prolong the suffering of these events," Patton said.
Saip's defense group had previously asked prosecutors not to require the death penalty.
We should task Nigel Farage to negotiate with Brexite, a Torah Member of Tory says
Today, during a protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the human army".
Former Ukip leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of their own Members Therese May suggested that they should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
On his hike in Birmingham, conservative Member Peter Bonne said that the United Kingdom would be “out by now” if Mr Farage were secretary for the peach.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mayeva in coordinating her deeply divided species was further highlighted by the Tories who favored the resignation of the Brexite, who joined a separate anti-brexithmic protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is seeking to maintain her plan in the track between the attacks by theefrosts of the Brexit, opponents of the Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between her package and "the chaos".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) convention in Solivul that he "wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interviewer and give him the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would be out by now," he said.
This MEP from Wellingborough added: "I will support the Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: "In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The thought that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely unreal."
At the meeting there was also a Torija-Brexitar Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘The Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unloved by our party and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election at all.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message intended for Ms Mayeva, she added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that policies should be given "feeling hot" if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue the Brexit, and today we're gathered here to tell them, "We're not gonna let you do this."
In the message, he added to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to give our political class, which is at the edge of the Brexite issue, to feel the heat."
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has guaranteed us a victory at the Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the remaining men walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two - hour meeting at the city center.
After the group was formed, a handful of activists waved the Torian flags against the Brexit this weekend.
The Labour Nobility Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for their safety problems when using the customer's application after the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all technology for Canada Plus agreement, for the border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
»This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good peach," he added.
Warren's potential bid for president's position will be "exactly examined"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "participation in the race for the presidential city will be carefully studied" following the November elections.
The journal The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-electioned in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation in order to cope with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of "town Hall" since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to apply for the post of president.
Warren replied that it is time for women to "become in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrested after the death of an LSU Sims player in a shootout
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in the shooting of a basketball player named LSU Wade Sims.
The police station in Baton Rouge is news of the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11am Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting and asked for help in identifying the man on the tape.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and finally died,” reported the network 247sports to police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade interfered to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department police station.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion's title, and the team tells him to let Sebastian Vettle win
On Saturday, it became clear that Valteri Boltas was qualified before Lewis Hamilton that "the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas had a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton on dry ground defending his position in the first two bandages and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton ride on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
After several driving actions, however, Hamilton noticed that the Ferrari driver left the inside open and risked being left behind after two defensive moves in the third corner.
He was born on the 19th day of his birth in the United States.
Afterwards, most of the race was without changing tires, as he intended to carry out a quick finish, beat Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally went into boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps he could not increase speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a rough day, because Valteri has been driving fantastically all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team did a really great job to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body rumor.
At the meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose the letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's investigation committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and false".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days, which we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the publications and the disclosures, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do it’.”
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer ... you have disclosed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it.”
Okay, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... No, we did not,” he added about the senator's impression.
Ford’s letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July, and the media was made public in early September — but Feinstein’s denial that it had come from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose her letter,” according to The Hill Feinstein’s report to the Commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential as she asked."
Her denial obviously did not suit the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, this was a really bad body rumor.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body rumor I've ever seen.”
In the defence of the Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president suggested that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
»They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, disgusting, they don't care who gets hurt and who they have to run over to get through power and control," the president said after reporting the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars versus Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their corporate loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday game in Dundee 5:3.
The Giants were led by two goals early on Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvilleer's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawnie had evened out for the homepage, and then Dwyer again took advantage of the Giants.
He equalized François Bouchard for the Dundees before the two goals of Lundvald Nielsen gave them victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who beat the Dundees 2-1 out of the background on Friday night.
This was the fourth season of the team, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 with the assistant Kendall McFaulla, Beauvilier, who won four minutes later, and was given by David Rutherford.
In the intensive opening work, Sullivan again took the game home at 13:10 p.m., and Matt Marquardt gave Cawnia an equalization at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer took care of the Giants on vacation when he won his second goal at the end of the first third.
The homepage reunited, and Bouchard compensated for the backlog with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cawnie and Charles Corcoran have unitedly helped Nielsen take the Dundees to the advantage at the end of the second third and take care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team half the time and take care of the victory with the fifth goal of his team in half the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
With his death, the air traffic controller allowed hundreds of people on board to escape from the earthquake.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after sacrificing his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
During the earthquake on the island of Sulavesi, followed by tsunamis, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to be rocked by powerful earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
Although fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a highly rocking control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He remained in it so that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was coming down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia representative Johannes Sirait said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian media house ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are beating when we hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of fatalities could reach thousands, as the Agency for disaster mitigation in the country said that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutonga is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase further, because there were many bodies under the ruins, and many of them we could not achieve," said agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves up to six feet [6 m] have been devastated by the Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings in the bodies.
We're running out of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palo and spoke to the National Army: “All of you I ask you to work night and day to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" After the CNN report.
At the beginning of this year, there were earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micro-Nesia Aeroplane crash: Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after the crash of the plane in the lagoon
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Minnesota now says that one person is missing after the initial announcement that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the immersion plane.
On Saturday afternoon, Air Niugini announced that a male passenger was missing.
They told the airline that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the missing.
They did not respond immediately to a request for more information about a passenger such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said they took seven people to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday who were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just ahead of the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“This is extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that along with other passengers, he managed to get through to the belt, reaching out to the emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were nearby repairing the pier had also jumped to the aid. They helped each other with the use of an inflatable boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane was immersed in some 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in the last two decades in aircraft accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the analysis of intelligence.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to determine the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received data on the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims, was reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was " lying because he was a [my] truck in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew her for about two weeks.
The video on the cell phone shows that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, he deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He deleted it from his life,” said Hale.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury was to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
The hiphop trio wants to cause a negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that hiphop has strayed from its original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently experienced the rise with artists such as Akal and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?!
New York's nanny is suing a couple for firing her for a "racist" message.
The New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatoryly firing her after receiving the misspelled message from her mother, who complained that she was "another black woman."
A couple deny the growthal treatment and compares the action with “extortion”.
In 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that she was a black woman at the arrival of the new nanny, Giselle Maurice.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, Mrs. Maurice sent it twice.
After finding out her slip, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable", fired Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, wanted to hire a Filipino, reported the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she and Uber sent her home.
Maurice now requires a couple in court to be compensated at $350 a day for a six-month period for the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like this are not done,” she said about the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable because they were afraid that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
Not a racist.
We are not a racist,” Joel Plasco told his husband about the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
When comparing the lawsuit with the "immigration", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going to get carried away like this?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings are still pending before the court, the public opinion court has quickly condemned a couple on social networks because of its behaviour and way of thinking.
Publishers of Bear Paddington's stories feared that readers would not connect with the talking bear revealed a new letter
Born shortly after the book was received, Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to know this now that Paddington has become an outstanding success.”
She said that her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he got the inspiration to write a children's book about a little bear toy, would be bitter at the rejection of her work, added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book was "greno-sweet".
With regard to Paddington the bear, which she described as a "very important member of our family", said his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man who did not like to brag," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even if you do not do it yourself.
I believe that Bear Paddington's success was seen in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the bear Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
At the time of the landing, her daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors made no effort to preserve her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that she really felt bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call. He told me that in the next two minutes she would die, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly ate and left her system.
She had been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit around and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the trial she was experiencing.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I had tears running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this intense sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving female glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to turn others away from taking a life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge are posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lyndey, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will trigger."
Mrs. Davis has made posters "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not establish eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they must process it: "She cut a hole in the whole family.
She's torn us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the beginning of an FBI investigation into the air.
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and scope of the limited investigation, this might make us even,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world was being threatened because of the hard-core party deadlock of the “decomposition”.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on November 6th, there are only five more weeks — if, as expected, Republicans cut off poorly, this will greatly weaken them in the attempt to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush made several phone calls to the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and who he introduced to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can raise at least 50 votes in the Senate, which could bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a breakthrough from the stalemate and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean Member said.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1127 people fled last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and the price hike required by human smugglers.
Pjongyang has yet to comment publicly on this.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised area between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, he attributed North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho to American sanctions.
"Without confidence from the United States will not trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for a job in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives has designated the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh as “histerical” and said that he is particularly inappropriate for the job in the Supreme Court.
Pelosieva thus said in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything else but to call a woman “histerior” if she were to be treated as such,” Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s investigation committee was made by Pelosi.
Kavanaugh was vexingly denying the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and suffocating his family and secondary years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and marked the accusations against himself as "a grotesque and coordinated muddy", organised by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she should not be appointed Supreme Judge, since it proved to be biased to the Democrats.
"I believe that with such statements and the way he handled Clinton and the Democrats, he was discredited," she said.
Pelosi's question is whether Kavanaugh will attempt to file a constitutional indictment if it is confirmed and the Democrats will receive the majority in the House of Representatives will become for a moment.
"I will say this – if Congress or the FBI is not telling the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi said that she was worried about the possible Kavanaugh decision against the Law on Accessable Health Care or the Roe v. Wade case as a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
And a woman's got to get her hands on him.
It's a fair outage, after months and years of spilling rage, and it can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you think?"
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere in charge who was also crying when she was angry, but developed a technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘I may seem sad because I cry.
I'm angry.’
Then she just kept going.
I thought it was top-notch."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger because people misunderstood them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career when I was still working in an office dominated by men, and I once found myself crying in unspeakable anger, is an event when an older woman — a cold leader — grabbed me by the neck, who was always a bit afraid of me, dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They will not understand that you are angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad to see you've been beaten."
Patricia Schroeder, formerly a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a boat called Monkey Business and had to leave the game, Mrs. Schroeder deeply downed that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” she said 30 years later in a laugh.
"For seven other candidates already participated in the game, and another was the last necessary thing at the time.
Someone then named the match “Snow White and Seven Thumbs”.
As she joined the last campaign, she lagged behind in raising funds, so she decided not to enter the match unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I will get a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — were so overcoming that she began to choke.
“We would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder remembered the media reactions.
"We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How the US-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salves of trade wars between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is not over long ago, experts say the division between countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export products, including solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which effectively means the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been retaliated each time by equivalent retaliatory measures, lastly with tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent per US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed to moving its eye with the United States and is unlikely to blink soon.
In order for Washington to give way, China should agree to his demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
However, experts say that if Beijing could make the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic shock in any country is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert associate focusing on Asia in the brain trust Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country, devastated in more than seven years of the ongoing war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation in the field is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal state.
All conditions are now met for refugees to return voluntarily to the country for terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome the aid in rebuilding the desolate state.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France, won the ryder Cup for 2018.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points necessary to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championship, scored a ball in the water at the 16th hole in a couple-3 game at his initial blow, which is why he had to hand the game over to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfers Molinari shined through all the circles and became one of the four players who ever since the beginning of the championship in the present form of 1979 achieved the result of 5-0-0.
With five and four, American Jordan Spieth beat the lowest European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup for the last time.
At 25.5 points, the veteran of the eight Ryder cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European player in the championship of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the cup again.
It is a team, and I am really glad that I could help," Garcia said emotionally after European victory.
He's handing over the relay to Roy John Ram, who beat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf on Sunday with 2 and 1 in the games of individuals.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games to play in France, and now he has a career record at the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 big addresses right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been working so hard all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing high-level golf all the time.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said, "I'm so proud of these boys, they fought."
We put a little pressure on Europe for a moment this morning.
We failed.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to reunite, and I'm going to cooperate with the American Association of PGA and our Board on the Ryder Cup, and we're going to move forward.
I really like these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Drop down.
They outplayed us."
