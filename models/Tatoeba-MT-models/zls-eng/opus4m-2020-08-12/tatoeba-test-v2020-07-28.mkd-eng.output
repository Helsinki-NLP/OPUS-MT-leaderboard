It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised he'd help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're getting cold.
I feel like walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Have I spoken to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's quit.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to our necks.
Tom pretended not to notice Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves have stalked the herd.
That song has been haunting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been up to?
Tom's homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They were suing the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is high.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little yellow in the cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would've been the one to answer the question.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit on the gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be brazen with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we're not from monkeys, we're from a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually have lunch with?
I consulted him.
Have you ever considered quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop infamous Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you related to the two of you?
He likes egg ham.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Have you done your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
I wrote this report myself.
Are these the kind of things you buy?
Doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
It was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out in this storm.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Should we really have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose flows every time I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree's green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom treated me like shit in high school.
Tom wore a hat that was still priced.
Tom promised he'd help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what the newspaper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would loan you money if you asked him to.
Tom is obedient, even obedient.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're man-eaters.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is it for the delivery?
I want some tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one like it, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're also taking checks.
Newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonia's has four verbs: expressed, conditioned, commanded and presented.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected its lines as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we be helping him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember how I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be the Japanese economy next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
What do you mean you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
It's a big court.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom drove me to fuck.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd love to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must continue.
You've made a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trolley.
Who do you have on the list?
He has a very strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom regrets is food.
Be careful not to get dirty in the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
You want some tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day they will try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom the police already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a brown room.
No survivors.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed softly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on his face.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly sick of giving speeches because of the severe speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
Weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
He's licked himself.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It's worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right to it.
Didn't you hear me call?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back.
Pull out the clamp.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Well, didn't you want the reward?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
Dishonest yourself.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is blunt.
We went bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just help me out a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a dive height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me back.
The electric heater warms the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the treetops.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you win?
Hello, ladies.
I'll sum up the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
His sleeve's stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They're sitting right next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom told everyone by mistake I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom had a bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Get him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the downhill.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Mustard's really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was being kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've seen anyone try that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She'll have to leave soon enough.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
He's been blocked.
Tom's in trouble.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
Says the previous dentist told him he'd remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Currito powder is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving around town with the brake up without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unjustly, and they do not realize that their own conduct is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
You want bowling?
Excuse me, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make a fuss.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What difference does it make?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such a pain in the ass.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom's made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
The bucket is giving you energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big shot for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom spells skillfully.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They must be dropping the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why'd you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes flashed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can accomplish anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
You gave me your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "I want to travel."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
He just wanted to meet Tom.
You need to get them help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom's richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of wish.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard-cores, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's start a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took his knee off.
Where did the pinoli come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom came along, and the crowd was clapping.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he failed.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking a turkey with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so whatever he wants to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete's not on fire.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm a mess.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
Always flaunt your English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very helpful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I've decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Your prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind it.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems happy.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was sick and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and I'll do.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, get better.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a whore dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is an emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the sugar to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
If you'd brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom had a light on his eyes when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't look very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven’t solved that riddle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue. This is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they're eaten by humans.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
Spending money is not water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's end this.
I've told you a million times you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book weighs.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's always lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very poorly muffled by sounds.
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you embarrassing me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels guard us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't do anything.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was available.
Tom's going into town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is Jave.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood before her.
There's more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six lazier heads.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's getting dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't have been stopped.
I'd love to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in charge.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
And the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was shed in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we'll be eating cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was incommunicable.
Tonight's good for me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramics that fell off the roof have been torn apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have kicked us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
Just finishing the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You better go.
Tom's got the exit.
I've got two machines.
What'd you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drunk.
It's on Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on a bus.
Don't fight me.
It seems hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The Amebites are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't necessarily mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his dad wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill you.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the French writing their word for "bubumara."
The lift can go 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good at?
We're pretty good.
The pork was cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to do something about it.
I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters have extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You have a guilty conscience, don't you?
I'm coughing blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, your nose's running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just need to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely gets out.
We set up a tent.
I thought it wasn't gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Let alone stay.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence isn't exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will soon realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are more reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
No more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
He's doing his maths best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
You put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
Makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the groom and every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not specific to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please give it your best shot.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long does this medicine take?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not record happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We're addicted to work.
The box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's evil.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
He was pouring sperm; he had a lot of sperm.
Tom's so boring.
I've been vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to dance, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one-legged.
Is Tom interested?
I got it right here.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's valuables.
That cake's calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm covering for Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you knew how to do this.
You're experienced.
What is not more dark about her?
It's not just a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not wiser.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you come out so naked, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say something, Tom?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got hurt.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've been making white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We don't need drama.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go myself.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom's a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
What's the shortcut for?
Thanks again for coming.
They're cheating on us.
The wounded soldier barely walked.
The sun just came up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often takes down movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light bounces away from the water.
Tom smudged the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the subjects on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
Is there something wrong with you?
Sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
They couldn't have been avoided.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you guys fight.
I should've been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was pouring his hose garden.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is don't give Tom any presents.
Tom was hardworking.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She's got short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He's down the downhill.
Shall I think of something?
I need to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
She knows more important capitals.
What's under the covers?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom to all the drinks.
You ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom approached them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly wouldn't say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her life.
Master teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm taking my passport.
It was a masterpiece they used to talk about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
Who should we start worrying about?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They've come to the conclusion that the ship has gone down without a doubt.
Did you buy the cure?
Did he drink Tom?
My job hurts.
The question is, who's gonna do it?
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He's on foot going to school.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very pretentious.
Now the question is what do we have to do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
Ended up in fourth place by 56 runners.
Don't make a fuss.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives across the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Weave a woolen sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never see you at that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are at risk.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to watch her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We heard carefully so we wouldn't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he's had a few beers.
You've got mercy eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, he'll fix it... when the willowee gives birth to grapes.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when is there fireworks?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't betray anything.
Just yesterday I was thinking about you.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair's falling off.
The big question that no one has found the answer to, including me, despite the 30 years of female soul research, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The villagers reap the harvest.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you tired of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
Everyone's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when it's your birthday.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep my luck!
The concert is over with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Hold on one second.
I've got something to deal with.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's just enough air in here.
She married zero from a man.
The wind is strong.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything like this.
The old man was taken before he died.
I don't like this book.
Luckily I did.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you call Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm talking about.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
The one who can hear butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They were pulling lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got great work to do.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like goods!
But if I had been in Brazil, I would have been much more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my work hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I've got the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food's cooled down, heat it up in the microwave.
The stream is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw him.
Tom's knocking a little.
Tom is so immature.
What are they up to?
How's the cylinder volume?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's had a drink.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the hammer.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom's got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales are kind of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Is he brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's getting ready to roll.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not retaliated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you want to know, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's what I'm good at.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
How did it come - how did it go.
His legs were numb.
Tom raised his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom's gone to Hadjilak.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been feeling well in two days.
It's too thin.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The coming out of this rain doesn't come into consideration.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an ace.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
Long time no see, boys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was shooting Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you even doing here?
Don't despair.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
Who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom got worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already do.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to swim the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This theme is taboo.
We barely got away.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see Mary was sending messages.
You'll be better off.
Tom was a little dizzy.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year.
Tom was motivated.
You may have to help us.
Most feel that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and crush her - it counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's going on here.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy kept quiet.
The hull of the ship is divided into several waterproof parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'll be washing dishes.
Let's leave this subject alone.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose weight.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear that knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not as shy as he used to be.
You know what I mean?
Don't make a scene now.
What was it told Tom?
We can help you find them.
I need to get him to help.
We've got a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys all over the place divided into groups, some playing jamleys, some tile, some with a ball, others riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain of love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I was just having breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from inside.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He hit his head.
We're gone.
Bring back the seat.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom gets mad.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
Today is less wet than yesterday.
It's hard to make new friends.
It's funny how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like cauliflowers.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell who wants the baby, because it points to both of them.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to head home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
Are you having lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her bottom has a slap on one side.
Let's eat something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Come inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail eventually.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does she cost over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just sobbing in my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I won't take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them right away.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the solution?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it'd be best if you called them.
They don't like some people.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts so much.
Then we were 18 years old.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I'm in a bad mood to see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Go on with it.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom started complaining.
I think you should choose her.
They're being polite.
You're great.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom took a hard look at Mary.
Tom wore a hoodie.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I swam in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
I felt much worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I've only had one glass.
Nobody writes me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to make.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
They're all in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I'm going shopping because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
They've been cursing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not exactly a mess.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, not expecting anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to freak out.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine fun like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom put butter on his toast.
We have work to do.
I heard him sniffing.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
The sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom was apparently used to these problems.
You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's tough.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary the doll.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if you can even say it's possible.
It's been a big day.
I bring bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcoming weakness.
How many pushups do you do a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was dying of alcohol.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is heavy.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
He won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You're depraved.
Everyone was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It might seem strange.
No one can save themselves from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble a lot of times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to go back here to Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to take the bus.
We're very pleased.
Do we need that much?
He was desperate for health problems.
You know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has an earache.
Dan got hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time right now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on Tom's mind?
Mother's advice would outgrow a friend.
We have not yet saved ourselves from danger.
Tom's freaking out.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.

Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Daddy, in an emergency!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this place open?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
In any case, I wouldn't want to get carried away.
Nobody wants to sit with you?
It'd be really nice if you didn't say anything.
Tom thought Mary had a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy.
I was a passenger.
I'm gonna fly out of school.

Would you like to participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the den.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I'd rather have coffee than tea.

I'm sleeping on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women end up running away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It is hard to understand self - injury if you have never felt the need to practice it.

Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in meals?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you give them a call?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's got a lot on his mind.
What kind of situations would you take advantage of?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all at risk.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.

I'm giving you one last chance.
Are you in some kind of sport?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours straight.
I got a quality one.
Did you find anyone to watch the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was after the thief.

Tom sneezed out loud.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has many problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.

I've seen it in person.
I love all my children equally.
I won't do what you ask me to do.

Whose picture is this?
There's no replacement.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where they're not there.

I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be at school.
I never say anything, even though it pisses me off.
You're below his level.
It's my turn to get early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom could hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom's very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, clear the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me meet Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't take more than five minutes.
If time was running, the radioactivity would have decreased.
Should we believe that?
Why are you so dressed up?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to the chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one else has done anything.
Sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a pretty good statement.
They must be worried.
I took him.
That gave me an idea.
The watch feeder's broken.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, after me.
This is a good place to park.
I'm going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
It's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to save the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's get some sleep.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they're paying pretty good.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This one's green.
Tom repented of telling Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom's muttering.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
They're all sitting down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're trying to get started.
His brother is patient of him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a thank you letter to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light's faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp around.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's very close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - each acquires his own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric is very stretching when washed.
Truth is purpose, not destination.
I'm covering for him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I've been out of class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard for me to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as a abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him out a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted the situation cleared up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
You can't make it this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's out.
Please repeat.
You're so dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She was gone to school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the crime scene.
I asked him the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a carousel.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They were drilling the spaceship.
Tom texted me over 30 yesterday.
Do you know for a fact that this isn't made diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unsustainable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.

Can I see you later?

We laughed.
Tom was a little smudged.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
Have a good trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to look busy so that Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping this seat for him.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers are coming out fast after you cut them off.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I was eating late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
In addition, I can fly.
We're out of money.
There was hate between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I wouldn't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never come to be anything but myself.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't heat me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Sometimes children fear darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.

Kube's hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is. I liked him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them growling.
Too bad I didn't drive a wheel here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you get there.
Mr Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.

I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?

I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.

That would be fun.

Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom's not gonna catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I didn't know whether to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at 7:00.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether he's coming to visit us next month.
Marionettes run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were teasing her for her clothes.
You'll be confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them one more chance.

Tourists were not satisfied.
Tom's got the socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like webs -- they hunt flies, but they let wasps and hornets break through.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, just like he used to.
He took off his fur jacket downstairs, went upstairs, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see it the same way, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
It was something to Tom.
You love your life, don't you?

We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.

Tom seems desperate.
You sound relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This handle doesn't spin.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my legacy.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Oh, dear."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
There's a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me take a breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
He's watching TV now.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can chain me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat stuck his claws in my hand.

This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.

The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do what you say.
He'd do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say something you don't mean.

I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do it.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were being chased.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've only got a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're a good cook.
There's no shortcut to the top, only to the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's been paid a lot of money.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automatic cars are now widespread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing a chair.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The organist was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
His aunt eats apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making eggs.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipe?
They picked her well.
What does all that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure spending the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a bum.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me last night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
He's changing to take a bath.
A river of sweat started pouring on my face.
Mary gave up moral values and became nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you guys get along?
The movies are great entertainment.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all smiled.
I didn't ask you for an opinion.
They canceled our flight due to unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they're coming back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board's against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made all the wood.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The cork doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee and Tom likes to drink soft coffee.
I gave her a fake address.
I'm in my room.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's sneezing.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
She looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take off your clothes.
I'm having a lot of problems right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether or not he can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost ran into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where were you, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you accept the tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who does?
I wish I could've been like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was raised with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I pissed Tom off a lot.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The islanders are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always liked mystery characters more.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent poets.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom Gemini will never come back here again.
Nobody likes crybabys.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a remote mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's a bit of a knocker.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We had a very nice meal.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely gets out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom's diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
Your memory's good.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little bit harder.
You seem to know the answer already.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It's been a great use to us.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We're screwed.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boney brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a couple of doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is made up of mostly poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the difference.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname looks perfect on him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You pulled your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his ass.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't speak so loudly.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and gave himself a polite bow.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks it's skillful.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a bastard!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom wouldn't give in.
Tom's been suspended.
They were getting along.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom's looking a mess.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
We may find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're not.
He works at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
We might get a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom's become violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom got mad.
It's from work.
We'll manage.
Commendations encourage students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two.
Tom measured himself on a scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “Lady ” was used only for nobles.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How to choose a man only one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a blood bed, with a dagger stuck deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
He used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your child's laughter.
Tom thinks Mary and I are doing something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear those thunderbolts?
Don't mix business with pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned the fan on and pointed it towards the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom's writing very well.
That's not entirely true.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as I hurt him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving to the back seat.
The bank loaned a million dollars to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom moved cautiously.
Just get inside.
He forged the sword from the steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls him husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more of them than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's getting mad.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their goal?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where you visited Mary yesterday.
You've gone too far!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you like?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch the show's gonna quit; they haven't sold much cards.
Tom's going.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughingstock.
Tom paid me.
It's my job to read books.
He's been executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom seems like a jerk.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own faults.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning on cooking Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I got the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one case less than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live in any part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was gonna water the garden.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Remember what you wore when I met you?
Lightnings are usually accompanied by lightning.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom cornered him on the ground.
This lecture isn't over!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you're still not sleeping?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing it.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I set fire to the waste.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a pretty good statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this just forewarned?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar sounds good.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and how she holds her head remind me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaking.
Tom would fight back.
She always works hard.
What country are you a citizen of?
The trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I prefer cats dogs.
There's still little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been painting her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took great care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the dad.
You know what I need.
This heat doesn't hold up.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you right now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you could say.
I can't deal with this problem.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I am still concerned about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree's floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We do everything together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits down long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for drawers in the kitchens.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom can't sympathize.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom's turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I'm having trouble with my sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you so.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's skillfully handling a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any websites on the Internet.
They're dropping the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from his illness.
I want a spinpop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was smudged with sperm.
Tom's fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand what happened to you.
Tom's trying to become a teacher.
Have a nice week.
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
They're too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
A nail blew the tire.
We're made of wood.
This is much better.
I'll get her to cut your lawn.
Tom's good for math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a mess.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We were eating lobster and stiletto.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They ran the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
Still no good.
Just quote me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, give me a call.
Was he honest?
The Filjani was empty.
Don't say it.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.

Please move fast.
I'm too young to die.

I'll call someone.
Where are these documents to be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the bathroom mirror is clouded.
Tom took pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They've raised my salary again.
I'll never get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.

What should we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I can go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they wiped my name off the list.
Tom put all this together.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's soft.
Previously, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.

Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
That's not what I was taught.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, that violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a Mr. Kimura on the line waiting for you.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was leaking from the feces.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.

Looks like these two are dating again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is a moral choice for the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he has produced.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd get him some help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems worried.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun varies constantly.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked deep in Mary's eyes and smiled.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
Yeah, you found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be notified in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a wuss.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powdered drug.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
Depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom measured you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her great - granddaughter.
It's our best chance.
Smells like flowers.
Tom's got a hard time.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think there's a frame for it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer's dead.
My grandmother used to live with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
Thus, our conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel might be a little expensive for you.
Tom raised the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were wrong.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen sheds green light.
English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is now festering.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom's a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like some mint candy?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
The blood vessel's cracked in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you could get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You wonder what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to get her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married when he was 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom's always trying to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast about the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying the piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as it took to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I've decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to piss me off, Tom?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light here to read.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
Guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's light.
Mr. Gorbachev, take down this wall!
Tom seems startled.
Tom's shaking.
It's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be tough.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you laughing at?
I'll call him right back.
It's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt this loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school in a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing your sayings?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
That's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
Just make me sick.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's mad as hell.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I've got a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom got here on time.
It's boring television today.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Tom found a four-listed baby.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say goodbye.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
That sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's safe.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
There, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept his mouth shut all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming about you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get our soul together.
I'm sure he'll pass the test he's about to take.
We're on our way to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He gave her a terrible kiss in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
On an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all Tom's money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom's got asthma.
Tom started moaning.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments do you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's unstoppable.
His girlfriend lost weight.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from a nightmare.
Tom's got weak eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your apron on.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom's got a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It's been an honor.
I spoke to my advisors about which items to collect.
I already wrote everything I had to write.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston's worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe it was Tom who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this one?
I want you to come back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it go on.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like that before.
You're so brazen.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dadeba really very slow today, or is it me?
Did you call me at Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back on.
That's how you need it.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I had too much to eat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You'd better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one in that place.
Stop!
Would you like some cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not clear at all.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's fucked up.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut your hair.
Anxiousness is a waste of energy.
Tom went into rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's just say you're right for now.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's what disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom's spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm making sure.
Tom hit Mary over the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusherly written.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom wasn't crying.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more regrettable than stupidity and indifference.
Everyone's crying.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What are the websites holding back?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been snowing all day.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is it far from Boston?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could have it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're so direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enia's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm getting sleepy.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We looked everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Hit this button.
Tom can really fight.
What's bothering her, really?
Do you have the keys?
Tom tore his car apart.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom wouldn't break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very much like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees have collapsed.
Lions don't know colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is tricky.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.

It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Uploading calendar to wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep from last night?
They've cast a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?

I don't know the end of the story.
We're done here.
I'm sure.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
You're losing something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thanks for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?

Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sucking on the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom's got his face out.
What's the use of you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when he's wearing those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live upstairs under this one.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.

I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're bothering Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.

Give her a chair.

Tom sat alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.

Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood.

Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Did you get cold out there?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom's the top guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Have you been writing in your diary today?
I just want this never to happen again.
Can he do it himself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peek through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into it right now.
Why are you bending?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're ready to go up and down.
Tom's got a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take out the tap.
I helped him clear the table.
I had a steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health if you walk down the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I even told them anything.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom drank.
I slept in the chun.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold on your short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
There's an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded it to Tom's schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's too bad.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
You saved us from the bell.
He's got me all over my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stopped.
Fun continues your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can make it here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
Do I need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing nothing.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just got Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it were higher.
I'm gonna go help my friends.
Turns out there's no Air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He came before them.
Here you go, brother, half way.
Tom sent the new fly he just bought to the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's full of shit.
The landscape's a long shot.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating his victory with wine.
We haven't got all week.
I'll try to contain myself.
The fall has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
They could fire me for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal to dignity and rights, and they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of universal human beings.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderbolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Soup's too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
Seems familiar to me.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basil, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a man of insight.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but she won't fool me!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I got hit.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a cobbler.
It's just to solve this problem.
They've got to remove the bullet that got stuck up his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much pain it hurts to be stabbed by catfish.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but there he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it doesn't come into consideration to ask Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make a face for him.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I get your name and phone number?
Tom hit me with a rock.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They've all got doubts.
I'm still thinking about her.
I found out today that there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom's still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
That's not what I'm good at.
Tom's got a collection of midwives.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are plague transporters.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's out.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king didn't predict the monarchy's fall.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That'd be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak pretty good French.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would you do that, Tom?
Who are you there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me out a little bit.
Am I here too soon?
Sounds pretty strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this all right?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his cords.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom's gone somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an unspeakable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little frowny.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave himself up to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medellín.
Did you stop beating up your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd get it.
Survive the species of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
A book will help you write skillfully.
This area is in the valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, air the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm making my toasts in the morning with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I assume the parrot escaped the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the number.
I'm impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take off my weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick word.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom's got a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good for sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I wasn't sorry for them.
Tom felt he had to make amends.
It's a message for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
He threw a stone at the dog.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock already.
I'm curious.
We can try.
You wrote this book yourself!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be conceited.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must isolate it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and frost usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to spilling red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Loara.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little forward.
I think about him every day.
I'll help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who knew that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic about his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs am I supposed to do a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come over here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want everyone shot.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke it and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more reliable.
Would you like to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
Yet, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
He's developing an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check on those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary got into her mother's head.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
It's over.
Tom wiped the blade off the jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your palate bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer pint on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
We're giving a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father's very strict.
Maybe I'd better stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how it's possible.
He looked sharp through my glasses.
Linda convinced Dan he was stalking her.
Why would they mind that?
Let's not get in the way of Tom.
This rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to free us.
Why is heaven blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did you hurt yourself, Tom?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
You've come over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression in many periods of his life.
Want me to grab your bags?
I'd trust that with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class goes wild.
There were penguin rates on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a tow truck.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I don't speak fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was eating something.
She's studying English.
With such a lush dream, he will become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna make it through this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spits the chewing gum.
Make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to acquire bad habits!
She's been acting weird.
Probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda about her interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are also strong.
The president looked strong.
Buy what?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's Tom ringing?
He's very handsome.
Let's keep an eye on the buyer.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now's the time to make up for it.
Most virgins have an entire hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stalled, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be fine.
Does she have a dog?
We're getting some rest.
Mary wore fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French more than he really did.
How long do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaking.
That medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's American.
Relax a little bit.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to your boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working fine.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese to cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Is that what happened to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini, finish up.
One - sex couples should not be able to marry.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear the letter away.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There is still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
The sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He hung me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
After lunch, we plan to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today was the first snow.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How many bets?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
The blood is circulating through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My thumb hurts on my right leg.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we going?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom bakes for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
They built their houses out of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this right now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean things like that.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a watch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
What age did you start to menstruate?
You're annoying me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very eloquent.
You were right, boys.
It happens.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a difficult task.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he were here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, dear.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about it already.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere.
Tom's incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
He's gone red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's no big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hooked up with a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these counsel in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What's in it for me?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't need to be around for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're so passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't feel bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I got off the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom needs to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom unwrapped the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood among the ruins.
Tom's a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Relax a little bit.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Hand me the pliers.
The Hague love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the bull.
Canada makes good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom had a good time today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you getting ready for?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I just wish I could live my life doing what I want to do.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
Desire is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary was about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, they raised it, and reaped it; the overheated river was turning water.
He feels hate for his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom drove Mary home.
I do a lot of skiing.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I need to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a mistake.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got rescued from getting caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's going to make up for the display?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You tricked me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're embarrassing her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We've got fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red at dusk.
I'm here to wish you luck.
It would be a pleasure if you would come.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I don't speak English.
We'll deal with it.
Bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan got this right.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's warm here in hell.
I've overlooked that.
This is your work!
Please come back to me.
He's cold in here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
You kids stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
Wonderful!
The palace has a high tower.
Kids have homework.
Let's go pick 'em up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's out of the way.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't sleepy.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here on his own.
I forgot my scarf.
We've been through a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he died.
Scientific research often requires difficult compromises.
Tom just got his prosthetics removed.
I have to try to find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed it.
I hate that horn.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
I wish I hadn't done it.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why won't anyone help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy that?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll kick you out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long's the road going on?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's been blind since birth.
The book contains fifteen résumés.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
The socks and the shoes are new.
I haven't had pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happier.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
Tom was buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Did she die of an overdose with sleeping pills?
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a butcher.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
It's raining.
Shoo, dog!
They jumped into the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we've eaten enough.
This is very difficult for them.
Witches don't cry.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The guy who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems impressed.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's her.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Do you have anything to sport?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom never said he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
It's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I only practice to look nice when I'm naked.
For thousands of years, it's been a millennium.
I'll put it on your tab.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
It's an honest word.
We've got three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you present it in a few words?
Tom was there.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I love cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom resisted.
Scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.

I really miss my mom cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to talking in public.
She cried with happiness.
Tom got out of jail.
I'm glad I'm working here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for the fire to go green.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I've gone with my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole other story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to the end.
I'm gonna go change.
You hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find me a head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never really, could happen here.
Tom was warming up before the fire.
This is what I don't want to talk about.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.

We can get started.
Come alone.
Run a pencil out of your pocket.

Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't take any chances.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.

Tom's just looking.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom's been waiting for us.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you going to do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're in no hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It rained two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you too.
You really should've let me get a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The cannon from the horse's hooves calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He called his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom's permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would've done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling ourselves.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much as I do.
I've flushed one.
Write your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom hasn't actually done it.
Is this your bag?
Sleeping will help her the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll do the dishes.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dolen's been working very hard lately, but he doesn't see the slightest result.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not convinced.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You've got rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for coming by.
I'm just as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
She spent the day last night drinking in a meat pub.
I'm in.
Do you need a rendez-vous?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
You wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow before.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have any tea.
I'm tired.
But that's no argument!
Tom's got a pie.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave Tom alone.
I've been through the shock.
That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
Then we were just a few people among a group of gorillas.
She started sticking her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the back pain you had?
That's what everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water flashes in the sun.
A is a set that consists of members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three went back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom's practicing violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Let's just say Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
Your car's on fire.
She was able to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I have no willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is rustic.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this kind of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom over.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean up.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Was it hard for you?
Tom could barely hear his voice.
Don't say a word.
I've decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep it off.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I'm starving to get down.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's no big miracle.
We need something to take our minds off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Save the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom could never have done it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new wristwatch.
Doesn't look much different.
You've studied.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
We're embarrassing him.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did you get it?
Tom wrote me and told me about his journey.
Your excuse is right up and down.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the gems last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetal movement?
I can't do it alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see him.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
Nobody gets fired.
There's no one else.
On my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom's got the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those leaves.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are extra.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them help?
Tom spits his mouth out.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not wrong.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
The virtue without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I assume you found it.
Don't take that too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going to do a point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
The snow is one foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's got the rattlesnake.
Now I'm gonna go look for Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without trouble.
You got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open page nine.

Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not quite happy with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to dance with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me long.
Tom's in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his parents about what had happened.
He was in the mud to his knees.
You told Tom about it, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's resourceful.
He's an honest man.
Your pajamas are too big.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
That's, however, good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom's here to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of the interactive signs is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.

Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom was wondering if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want us to take you home?
That house was built of bricks.
We haven't reached any conclusions.
Tom came in at about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat infuse.
The crowd was clapping.
I'm letting the delineations grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what are you looking at?
We're in business.
I was too tired to go on.
It's got its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson last night.
Can this page be used similar to Twitter?

Don't you feel lonely?
Did you make coffee?
Don't be so happy about it.
Stop talking to me.
He's always happy.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intruding.
Most of the clothes the Europeans wear are produced outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look online.
When I was younger, I always traveled by hitchhiking.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here for them?
When I pee, something like a feces come out.
You beat her.
The stars have turned up.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your own personal army.
I play volleyball a lot.
Where's the shirt I got you?
That'll teach them how to do it.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom, run along.
We're ready to fight.
I suggest you listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.

All the balls are yellow.
I got a white cat.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they hit anyone?
The factory makes toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out myself.
The room has an ocean view.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like cattle.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of mankind.
It's still for sale.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
From time to time, I'd be blown by a carriage.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do this in one day.
You almost got stoned by horror.
Suddenly I felt old.
They piss me off.
You were getting some sleep.
I'm ready.
He killed him to avenge his late father.
Tom took a cookie.
I've been studying French since I was 13.

The bull's in pain.

Born in 1960.
How about one?
Baburas are usually mild in taste.
I'm upset.
It could rain today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Wouldn't you start picking hairs out of it?
How are you gonna get away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing to do.
She's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom, listen.
I think I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The noise will wake the baby.
I'm late for a spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom sat on the two-seater with Mary and watched TV.
We don't mind.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How's yours?
I'm not usually at work on Monday.
I'm a fool for trusting them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
I'd be broken.
There's a lot of traffic in the bar.
He's dropping the idea.
Tom was more and more surprised.
Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did you work the dishwasher?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, this soup is too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You'll have to learn more next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one wants Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fill out your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom's got two seats.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like best.

If possible, I would like to experience once again such bitter love as the basic one.
I saw Tom around.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom broke the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom suggest this?

Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to watch the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.

I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't focus on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became addicted.
I just want the money.
I don't say mean things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom had gone.
How bad was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something strange happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't pick.
Is there sugar?
Dan and Linda finally moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
It looked funny.

We live together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry, isn't that a mistake?
I didn't say anything.

Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
Tom used to say that.

According to you, how did Tom die?
I've decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have a job to do.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I take a picture with or without flashes?

Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They're too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's a minor now.
We don't sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I got back on the bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe the cat was that.
The fight seems to be about to end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's distracted.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and get it over with.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put the collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our party.

I'll go if Tom goes, too.
We'll be back in a few months.

I like you very much.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, lazy boy!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I'm not waiting to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one likes us very much.
It's very rare.

You won't find them.

Can anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I've got everything in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It's been hard for us.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on the chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was from them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital recovering from his overdose.
He cracked the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were about to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's the face.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We've put her under surveillance.
Tom's untrustworthy.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet cap up.
That's good training.
This capital is unique.
I should've said no.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactics.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my libe.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the cover of the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should be sorry for them.
I don't bargain.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's quite a top.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Keep him busy, Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom swears too much.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through deeds.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
Such behavior was childish of him.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Leave while you still can.
Tom was a little embarrassed about Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the carriages.

There's nothing else to look for.

We can't do that.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.

Tom doesn't have manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the lamppost in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell out of a tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the mild things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will go astray.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got stabbed by something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch him, Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants what's best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you sleep at least a little?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new to this town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're busy enough with your worries.
I don't think Tom's gonna be much help.
Tom seems worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if he had anything to do with it.
We could've made it.
This is nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, a football playground and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should've quit sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom, turn on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that horrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds perfectly acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give up.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna shut up.
She shut down the computer.
She bought it at the butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two generations in Ireland.
One thing at a time, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's got his hands full.
Tom was up-to-date.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them with me.
The noise has disturbed the entire city.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You've got small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was in the middle of it.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing an attack outfit.
Tom was barefoot.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we had to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, and second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems bored.
I'm growing cattle.
She borrowed the ruler.
I'll see you around.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom participate?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could've helped you more.
You can't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely refurbished the facade of the building, and when I drove past her in a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Ask him to join us.
Doing so will not be easy without great help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar is leaking.
You're gonna need a wrinkle.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser throws hot water out every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
Belkim, you're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here by my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always been helped by someone.
They don't want that.
Tom takes over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
Valuable stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've had enough of the chickens.
It's been a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered all kinds of things nobody else remembered.
You can easily tell them apart.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I have learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote his homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
Boyfriend looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project isn't going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deep.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily ashamed.
Is it getting there in a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom's got plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful bracelet.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a large amount of money from her.
Can you help me figure that out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make webs.
You really talk a lot.
It could be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what other people say.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter isn't married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're out of your mind!
It seems to me it's the only possible conclusion.
Sometimes people ask me what I'm gonna do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound died.
Who cut your hair?
I don't quite understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't take it.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
I think it's possible I'm sneezing.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom's not talking to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to watch him?
You're a real man.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
Nobody's talking.
What did you think of contacting them?
There's nothing you can do.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated any differently than before.
You should be fine.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You've already done it.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was having fun listening to the music.
Try your shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did you tell Tom his party was about to start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs are still sore.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to watch over you.
Stop where they are.
Are you her pimp?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
Her sister gave her a flu shot.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while he was cleaning his gutters.
You got something to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help it.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the compositions were good except for yours.
I don't think Tom's going to be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday's gonna fall on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom seem happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deep.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I was.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try it again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it unless you show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing looks more like a lunatic than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking his clothes off.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This is almost working.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The bandits tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their arrogance.
Dan missed no episodes of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had done well.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everyone.
We'll be right here.
Why do they do that?
I studied college for four years and got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, all that's left is ashes.
Tom wants every vegetable but a cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll drive Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't create miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to shut him out of their company.
Those who mix the verb endings "-tsya" and "-tsya" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened next?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
That's not what I was counting on.
I was careless.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take us long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom's got two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences this month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You made some money.
It's really bad.
Would you like some cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I feel a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all-wise and all-godly.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom's moving forward.
Tom's got his car well.
You're interesting.
I can win this time.
All humans on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need any help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I'm here to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe him.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks the Caucasus language that has neither common phonems nor common letters with English, can completely overcome English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.

Our attempts were in vain.

These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You'll have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Take care of this mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary is.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
Why didn't you help us?
I'd like to learn French a lot.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned a lesson the hard way.
You showed my friends the forgeries.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm sick of it.
He was eating a kale salad.
I'm going to run.
Tom's chewing something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom never visited Boston.
I'm glad to be independent.

I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and have a look.
Do you think you like him?
Innocentness is the most common blessing, not virtue.
Tom's heart rate's up.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept nagging about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, courageous, and yet I don’t know what.
Have you lied to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You're busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom wants his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I'm getting uncomfortable with heteronormal propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold on much longer.
The virtues are their own reward.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to act here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom nodded.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's wrong with me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
I've got all this stuff waiting for me.
Is this diamond real?
You know I don't eat meat.
He seems very sleepy.
Yesterday I prepared a mushrooms pastry.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!

Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The temperature on the surface of the sun is supposed to be about 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit [6,000 ° C].
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd's gone crazy.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to question him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did he want to eat, Tom?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom turned him down.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Somebody killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're just in time.
I was kind of sorry for you.
Cigarettes suck for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavalier would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't play Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I have to spend more time at work.
What kind of situations would you do that for?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Luckily, this shed is stable, or the storm would have destroyed it all last night.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got everything written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll give up.
Mary’s eyes shined with pleasure.
It's evil to swear.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How many are you guys doing?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's acting secretive.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman tricked him.
Everything's in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.

It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I've been thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?

I have dinner plans with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple matter.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to speak to her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Dadeba's new version.
It all looks pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did you really do it, Tom?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not up for sports.
I'm appalled, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Get your horses out of here.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very alone.
I'd like to try new things out.
Tom wasn't the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He did wonders.
The glands produce chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was helping her.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
Good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could've said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It'll happen soon enough.
Hey, it's suffocating in here, get me out before I choke.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom was gonna say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was being polite.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay whatever you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where's the meeting gonna be?
Let's play Truth or Challenge.
His conclusions are based on unproved assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started reading the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom likes flowers very much.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I passed out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife gets sick of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebs are one-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom twisted my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but it's more durable today.
I'm cold.
He walked right in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
It's possible someone was following them.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a bank.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to talk to him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He left soon.
The children were so excited after the party that they could not sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You defeated me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive mother.
An international language would be very useful to mankind.
I was helping them.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't fool me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Nice weekend.
Would you like some soda water?
Tom winked at the girls.
We took a terrible turn.
Tom seems different today.
Throw them off deck.
Japan as a country has many different features.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
Don't be so perverse!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your salary.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom launders money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you could swim?
Don't pressure Tom.
They betrayed me.
And there's no paper left.
Tom can't express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb creams, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is heavy.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor's looking at the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke is rising in the air.
The printer isn't working.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's feeling much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.

There's no way it could have been Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have a strong resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I was watching Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and engine lubes.
How was yesterday?
You have to learn hard.
We can't fire them just like that.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelette.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got you, didn't they?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unsettled.
Tom thought Mary was gonna enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I go to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy ran to me.
Tom seems very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic components of living things.
She's being entertained.
I have to go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom was soon lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a beaver.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you keep your eyes shut when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I totally misjudged her.
It'll be over soon.
I didn't say I agree.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's snoring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the Semir.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted them inside the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm happy about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Anything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird lifted the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom wasn't the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna do with them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best quality.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got wavy hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's really strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was hit.
I have a guilty conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's been drinking tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You've been messing around.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
There's something going on with Tom.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got the hearts together.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most effective advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to take a bath.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom had done it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just be in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I've learned it for nothing.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach, so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's up to you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt from the other side.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm going crazy.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom's got a loud scratch.
It was Peter.
Tom started sobbing.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaking out.
The can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom, relax your hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the AI flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it would be hard to pull it off.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Although I am a man of honor, I am still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
He's not that angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to examine something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you building?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary kept him quiet.
We met in the mess hall.
How was Tom doing?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I'm sorry.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't groan.
Tom's regained consciousness.
Tom pissed off Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be coming today.
Tom doesn't know the difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's go already.
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We were out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul isn't human because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they have a cure for that yet.
Each member must attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You must let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're righteous.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go see Tom.
Did he buy Tom presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You pulled your clavicle while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
Show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was a pain in the ass.
This isn't an easy decision.
His prophecy came true.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was up for anything.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom like a hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves for that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom seem angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave him to me.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy as hell.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
You don't need to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom wouldn't sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look a bit apprehensive.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house on slippers.
I think Tom's a stickler.
It's a terrible infection and the ovary and it's gone.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't cost.
It's out of the question.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's been acting weird sometimes.
We'd hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake out of capees?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right away.
Hold on to the subject.
She really likes to gossip.
I have to ask you a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Each language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is sacred land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We've got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where the hell did you find her?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got into a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shaking at him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathering in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven’t called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your ankle off.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little smudged.
