Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that they “look like Muppets ”
Some members of the congregation are amazed at the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party is concerned that it is "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means "freak/dude", and pwp means "kaka".
A Plaid member said the party is "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party's actions were "free of mind" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and the "muppet" (ang. Muppet) is large.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any words by which members of the assembly will be appointed, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The Wells government law of 2017 gave Wells the power to change his name.
In June, the commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals that pointed to great support for the appointment of the assembly as the Velski Parliament.
On the issue of the name of members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Welsh parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shriveled as the churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and church at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socialised in another way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in settlements where people go regularly."
And for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the settlement.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that's why it will speed up the day these churches close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built on the white congregation before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists moved away in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people who practice their faith nearby takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Negro congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of sellers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's been going on in St. Martin's in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the unprofessional leaders of the church, and part of the bishop's diocese.
The church board, the church’s governing body, made up of unprofessional leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese “will require the transfer of expenses” to the church board, although the church’s board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old kid diving for lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 p.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel declared that he first thought it was an excitement to catch the lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ He bit me!
You bit me!’
The whole clavicle was seen," Hamel said he had noticed since he got to the boy.
"I called for everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to a children's hospital working in San Diego, seduced as if he were in critical condition.
There's no telling what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach savior, Captain Larry Gilles, said at a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark was spotted in the area, but decided that the shark was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorised authorities have closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's taking over Boots, SuperOther and Debenhams with shelves for beauty in the style of stores full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom that weighs £2.8 billion, which continues to rise as sales in the fashion and household sectors declines, large shelves of beauty will be tested in 11 shops all over the country and will be represented in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of shelves that were once intended for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of Boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Craydon, South London last week, and the second one opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and buying smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more and more like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous gallons of stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they believe increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganise its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement on how to split profits from chemical goods stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the appearance and feeling of our beautiful shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones has been "angry" since Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million-pound deal.
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Dan left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The couple's business is connected to the Goop brand of Guinea Paltrow.
This 37-year-old morning programme leader told Instagram she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, Dragons Dan's star, withdrawing from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghemshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean she no longer has time to devote herself to their brand Truly for products and household allowances.
Business is linked to the Goop brand of Guinea Paltrow and was said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain at one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long - term future that she would send over the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all the affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe's headquarters full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s programme guide, one of Britain’s most paid stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in pillow and candlestick products, clothes and household products, and the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replaces Ant McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity (I'm a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We do not comment on his business ventures".
Serious conversation “and then we fell in love ”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media about making comments some would consider "non-presidential" and because he is so positive for North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said in his voice he was recast as "a newsrepresenter".
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the deanclarisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denoucularisation have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North is not seeing a "adequate response" from the United States about North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We are very much in agreement with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results -- completed missile samples, helped free hostages, and the remaining US troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking to Kim.
"It is easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and claimed hundreds of lives
The consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, have been told by foreign NGOs that they are not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, no natural disaster has been declared, a precondition for obtaining international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is a challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
Although “Save Your Children, ” a team will travel to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that continue to affect Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for nature’s anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, though a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and tracks.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of reelections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands moved from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Look: Daniel Starge of the Liverpool team equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from losing to the Prime Minister's goal league in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost by 1 - 0.
He moved the ball to the left before pointing it to the far side.
The ball was moving high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Kepa Arizona and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante coming and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just kicked."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in 25 minutes.
The "blue" attacker put his heel back to Mateo Kovacic in the attack, before kicking the ball almost halfway through the field, and then sprinted it into half of Liverpool.
They quickly gave up with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, taking Hazzard to the 16th century.
Hazard passed the defense and finalized the network of a far-off flat with a left foot hit next to Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples in the 3 p.m. Champions League's group phase Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the 7.5-strong earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a shot from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds to Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is in the initial phase, but I would ask the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspiciously contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in a facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and as police say, they will inform the victim's close people.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no entry was allowed, no exit from the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants are now told that they will be hours before they can return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying “it’s so terrible. ”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was outside.
Many police officers were standing in the cordon watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact anonymous crime fighters at 0800 555 111, quoting a record 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue of parliament has become the latest memory blow in the dispute over "recording history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure would become a goal at the Palace of Westminster.
The econoclast of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
The wonderful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s Cromwell is evidence of the 19th - century opinion and part of the history of a figure many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it's a completely accurate performance is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer tore apart and killed a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a southwestern China market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the last name "Juan", was found dead with a broken artery, dressed in blood near the rim of the market in Liupansui in the province of Gicou, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pig farms on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig carriage.
He declared that there was a large boar with the blood on his face.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound boar tore up the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn," said my cousin, named "Wu," according to a quote in Guayang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people, while police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market participants are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “activater. ”
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just need to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to the southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves across cold waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a hurricane of category 1 from 5.00 Eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression begins over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the western coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to bring huge tropical moisture north of the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create heavy rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, the flow of ruins and possible landslides in the desert.
Large tropical moisture will cause rains that will be approximately 2 to 3 inches an hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The sudden floods are possible because of the rapidly exacerbating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to go to the desert on foot when it is possible for tropical rain.
The torrential rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
Proximity approaching will bring local rain on parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch [half an inch] are possible, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Periodic tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads more late Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rain will spread to "four corners" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected throughout the United States because of the Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be found in central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There are almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures in 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast points to the possibility of overaverage temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault reportedly took place in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the staunch political situation continued, with speakeres interrupting regular turns-on programmes at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, made a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's trial committee that he was 100 percent certain Cavanaugh had caught her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that displayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To show it better, it is an audience with a size similar to a playoff competition in football or awards at the film academy.
Fox News, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavanaugh's appointment, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the full day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderately Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him shouting at him Friday morning as he tried to enter an elevator for the hearing of the trial committee.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes as they reprimanded him, and all of it was transmitted live to CNN.
"They stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on the ground?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was due to vote to advance Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate for voting.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that would consider the charges against the nominated next week, which was asked by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Küns.
After talking to Kuns, and with a few senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had great significance because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over the coast
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the British future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to the one with her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the borrowing costs was "fully absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: police arrest suspect Diteon Simpson for the death of a sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Sims' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diteon Simpson has been arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS's WAFB partner said.
After being questioned by Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of East Baton Rouge announced a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The thanks to the Louisiana state police refugee unit, the state police crime lab, the South University police and citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked police for its "activity in the search for justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-footback grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, basketball team coach at Louisiana State University Will Wade said the team had been "destroyed" and "in shock" since Sims's death.
"This is what you care about without stopping," the coach said.
Vulcan tosses ashes on Mexico City
The eviction of ash from the Pokatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
A national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go towards the volcano after starting activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered over a period of 24 hours.
The center was followed by more thuds and earthquakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in settlements in Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists observed increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Gojo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights broke out, and police used their thumbs to suppress fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted "There is no forgetting, there is no forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low because of a boycott by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance of gaining independence.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
While winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamics alive this year with many of their most famous leaders either in a self-elected persecution or in custody pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and a successive declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording a protest to support police, said the conflict was backed by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before last year's trial, announced he would run for next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the repression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonders: Men Arrested after Car Burst in House · Global Voices

The incident took place in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and to the building itself.
At some point, he may have been shot with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
The advanced Livingstone has been stifling Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibroks Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be significant while Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernyan in second position.
Gerard's country has lost its victory in this season's championship and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are eight points behind.
Earlier, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the six-game division, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team had to lead long before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after he slid the blow with Craig Halkett's head over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they could create problems with their actions.
And that's exactly how the crucial goal came in.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set Menga, who only touched the goal from the center of the 16th century.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly didn't play.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos is a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score a goal due to the skill of Ranger goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set of action on Livingston.
Livingstone's 16-year-old has been constantly passing through and has been continuously defended, while two requests for penalty -- after Halket's dispute over Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for hand-to-hand play -- have been rejected.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston - Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was remarkable, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still held Connor Goldson and Joe Waral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard's guidance, they are now lagging behind in the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the hosts – and it was a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed admission in Colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have deteriorated due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Kolonia to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also pleaded, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposed protesters reflect the division of a visitor celebrated as a hero by some German Turks and criticised as an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident on a trip to Deptford: cyclist dies in a car crash
A velosipedist died after a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection on the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeast of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been set up and buses are being redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison police officers were injured in a high-security male prison, according to the prison's office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Vorchestshire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Tornado units were brought in to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited in one wing.
Cops have been treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lantin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, police for public order and peace were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with rapid floods (may be useful for the dry areas)
Tropical depression is rare to affect Arizona, but this is probably what will happen early next week when the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest region, bringing the risk of sudden floods.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible floods Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, down to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and North Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move along a direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 inches] of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches [6 inches] on the edge of the Mongolian Mongolon.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated spots up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain will likely benefit because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Monitoring Body, almost 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," said Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path led to landslides all over the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles [85 km] per hour, is 385 miles [385 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north by 12 miles [12 km] an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific and is shrinking.
So rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and southern Utah until late evening Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is the many heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States," the State Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and ruins, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsamer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a “stable” state.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstok area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone records from the event to step forward.
Trump said Cavanaugh "suffered the Democratic Party's greatest malice and anger".
"The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for rejecting the most cruel and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump told a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh "suffered the Democratic Party's greatest malice and anger during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassi Ford's accusations that he had committed sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
"Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not running, but I am really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and interfere".
The first key vote on Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many were carried away by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves of 6m (18 feet) hit the shore at sunset, bringing many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5-strong earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB agency for intermediating in the disaster of Indonesia in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, dragging cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos of air released by the disaster agency depicted many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The following tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's (BPPT) technology assessment and application agency said that energy released from the massive earthquake Friday was about 200 times higher than the energy released by the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow shore, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shot of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast 300km (190km) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in an announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floors of a building screaming insanely, warning people on the street downstairs about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water crashes onto the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a power cutoff that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to co-ordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia has climbed over 800.
It's really bad.
While the staff of World Vision from Dongala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees took refuge in cedar shelters in their office's yard, they went through scenes of desolation, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's too bad.
Even as the relief groups began the dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Ulija Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the wonders that would make the black story of natural disasters easier.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the bat for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Paraglidering Team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, when news began to circulate about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliderist community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray tickling sign, instead of a son.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a cash-up at the Newport at the pier.
Thieves stole $26.750 from an employee of Brink's who was adding an ATM to Newport's Key on Friday morning, according to a press release from Newport's police station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses noted more suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kañe West: Rapper Changes His Name to Jai · Global Voices
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yay.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanje West".
Forty-one - year - old West wore the nickname "Yay" for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to give up "emotional reasons", the showmaker said.
Although using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said the word had religious meaning for him.
"I think that 'yy' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with Radio Manager Big Boy.
"What does it mean I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left Kanye, which means the only one, to Yay, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former West associate, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a cartoon and all the capital letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use military on civilians
Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelko Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number one in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"A double of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Li said in an interview with CBS this week.
Li, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who are investing in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked American hijacker, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Li thanked the previous US government technology competitions as a challenge in robotics by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next match will be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to obtain state grants, Li said.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders, it is the corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of science by artificial intelligence," he said.
The China State Council issued its Development Plan for the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organisations spend money on researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an Authorised Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100m annually in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that required the creation of a National Commission for the Security of Artificial Intelligence has not been operational for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues its northern neighbour's name is to lay claim to its territory and veto its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign doubted whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question of the referendum ticket was, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there are no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Djoše Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their voice in Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
The poll, released last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
To succeed, the turnout should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since they came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City spent Brighton's entire defense goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton’s 2 - 0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between Brighton's three defense players before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four “greens. ”
He bypassed a defense player before he ran a few others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then filed left of him, at Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to the 16-year-old to return Aguero's ball, which beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“ We talked about playing 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you scored at that point."
But the initial advantage of "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister's League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a couple of times before she took Sterling to the far side.
The attack on the "heavenly blue" put the ball into the net before it came out.
City will fight Hofenheim in a 12.55 Champions League match Tuesday in the Rain-Necar Arena, Germany.
We've got to go. We've got to go. We've got to go.
Since Nashnels were eliminated from the fight for the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But always competitive Sherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for Rockies' team, which lead to a single match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies' team had at least a wild card for a 5 - to 2 victory over Nashnels on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we are not playing for nothing, at least we will be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals are still due to announce a starter for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Sherzer to throw himself into such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start on the 34th trip, trained to pitch Thursday and throw the usual vacation on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike points in 220 2/3 in the season.
Mitinzi for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
"Everything we have done so far will be placed at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big - I am not running, but I am really fighting, so I am everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all available means, you see wickedness, impudence.
They don't care who they hurt, when they need to run over to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and interfere".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, rude and untrue".
He mentioned Senator Diana Finestein of the Democratic Orders, set up by the Senate's Judicial Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with a statement of disdain.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Ah, what.
No, no, wait a minute – that was a very bad body speech – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When the activists of the moment in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in a line of members of parliament from the Labour Party to which we have been told that we are not welcome - just because it is expressing its opinion.
My fellow parlementary, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because he took a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censoring movement criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Nottingham's East Lab Party meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party's parliament, meetings of the council were just like that on Friday night.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of “mild, gentle ” politics has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the labor party, and each opinion is determined whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my mind and take positions that I would never otherwise take, whether it was national security or the EU's internal guard.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media that calls for conviction, denial of the policies of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the labor party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great awe for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the labor party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "do not trust" or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes with closer opinions.
I have received many advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the government's lack of concern for Thatcher's government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed them, whether as a local adviser or government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Bragzit to hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have one message that is not for Nottingham right now, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how many judgmental threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeaten Air goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Air deserved the triumph in this wonderful entertainment match on the day of the Scotland Cup in football.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
Eventually, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, carried by the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose stated: “Praise for Ear, they took better advantage of their chances than we do. ”
Grant Anderson's score in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear a head start, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Warriors, enabled Melrose to improve numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo extended Ear’s lead with a penalty, earlier, exactly in the halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17 - 5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose got off to a good start on the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long detention because of a serious injury to Ruardid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and from the beginning, Air continued to struggle with Stafford McDowell's point, converted by Klimo.
Air captain Blair McPherson then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with an unconverted point on Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team threw up and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow Clima without the ball, McPherson won a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took the hit of David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.

"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes court will reopen path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the covered-up Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to have him back."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see a decision taken by the international court on large screens all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here is Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of native origin, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favour.
The Dutch-based UN body did not have the power to allocate Chile's territory and said it would not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
That the international court ruling comes only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have reversed Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court's decision-making is unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Kalsadija also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the problem of the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to believe that the extended sanctions and US objections to the declaration of ending of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion shows the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest shops in your vicinity
If you want to improve the size of your collection of drops or completely block the sun, then do not look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy big hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that blinded the style set on Fashion Week in Paris.
The extremely impractical hats started Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eyes of the runway.
The piece that was highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide edge in the form of feathers that flooded the model’s head.
The other too large additions included zirconia watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment full of glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted cone of ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style followers predict that giant hats can come to stores near you.
The big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, a straw hat with a two-foot edge that all carry from Rijana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cool fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread through social media sent another great creation along the runway, a straw beach bag of almost equal size to the height of the model it pulled.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia pine and a white leather handle, was the piece that was highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques on Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity Stilist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many extras. ”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exams, which only increases with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an electoral subject in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, he will do so in a way that is devious.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent test results, we can see that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign languages achieved a higher score of "5+".
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those learning French and 63 per cent of those learning Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen as an elective object at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools programmes, as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the KOK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 noted that out of the reasons employers cited for job failure, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically favour the polyglot over competition.
According to the YouGov poll in more than 4,000 Ok adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to talk, and French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when seen in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future will bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the country's future, so this must be pictured in schools.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be viewed as “the international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
“Il faut bien le faire” (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will lead the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait almost ended for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first pre-season match Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays, it's not decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," the Lakers' official website said on Walton.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play limited time.
After early Sunday's training, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the preseason at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Yu-Tub channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of myths as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled myths in next week, including visits to favored places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his choice to fill the blank spot in the Supreme Court is still, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans can lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's meeting tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 pm. Time zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia via live feed on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominated for Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who has become tense due to allegations of misbehaving of sexual nature by the expected delay in the Senate vote until one week, as the FBI investigation continues.
The primary goal of the rally series is to help the Republicans win a swing for the November elections.
Thus, from President Trump's campaign, they said the five myths next week are aimed at "incentive volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majoritys they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible as possible with the beginning of the difficult campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
Scheduled at the Vesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, according to news from Metro from West Virginia.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisei that the president must come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team shows courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one - sided seasons, the four of them on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Cup Ryder needed.
The twisting of happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we have little luck I suppose," Jordan Spitt said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of leading four points and another twelve games.
According to Spit, Americans feel they have a weak wind in the sails even though they have sufficient incentive, if nothing else, then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spit was excellent, and he leads by example.
Those strong celebrations grew stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the equalisation of four or four when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His blow to the game at 15 was met with a similar cry, telling you that he believes that the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to be deep and worry about your game," Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Cup Ryder.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and cannot be wrong.
Molywood was the only couple without bad punches on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad blows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way it seems to flow their energy to and from this noisy group ensure that they are players who will win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will ensure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, other than Fleetwood or Molinars.
It's preferable both at the same time to different holes.
However, talks on European fame remain unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he joined Alex Noren.
A missed blow and two doubles from the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they disobey, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership on the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led by 10-6 on the final day of Cup Ryder
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of Cup Ryder after Saturday's lead in double pairs and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far on Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy you lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team that had many misses in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans resisted the four, winning two matches, but they couldn't get the lead.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After they "smacked" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson DeShambu with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, played great at moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 double matches and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's double couples, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in four with the defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kotka -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive victory 2&1 over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the double pairs and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in four, but lost to the initial, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder a certain team has recovered from a four-point loss in an individual game, although as title holders, Furik's team was satisfied with an equal score to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says there is “no way ” to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance that the country will give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" in last year, such as halting nuclear rocket tests, decommissioning nuclear test facilities and committed itself against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to joining the nuclear disarmament "in phase", under which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for its steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to give in to strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and raises the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is the vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end up in such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles towards the American mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, much more praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "Is it two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council sanctions must continue fully and without exceptions until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours because of "gangster requirements".
North Korea is committed to meeting with Moon this month for disarming a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he is seeking are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho learning culture by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher discovered that the world’s leading university students often know nothing when it comes to basic care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designs a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of undersleeping on learning.
"At the end of the lecture a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic results, and improve the general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of a student home where students press on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how undersleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine in going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how the long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheeseler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" being broadcast from electronic screens and LED lights, which shifts the circus rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Goal takes down Gerard's People · Global Voices
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Stephen Gerard's dismembered team to lose 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register its first victory since the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard's second team in 18 games as the manager who left his team with eight points behind the rogue lead team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' configuration lost inspiration and chances of evening out.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston has climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after Line Judge Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for head trauma after he was apparently hit by a distance object.
Gerard has made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semifinals of the Batfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingston who won a point with Harts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained position was suffocating his opponents on every occasion.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the beginning of Menga's first game, when Scott Pittman went to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed his chance.
Then the impact from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly did not suffer from the head blow of Lassana Culibali and the weak blow of these Edarias.
Although the beginning of Livingston's 34th minute may have been the opposite during the game, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their game.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga as a simple ending.
Gerard reacted during the halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his blockade line.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the kind of game they enjoy, with Litgow and Hacket caught a lot of long-term additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set himself up well and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty request after she crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson did not approve again.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor · Global Voices
And now one side of our Almanac "On Sunday of the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and WE ASSESS ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a gamer counter.
Since then, it has become a major stronghold of science, the Geiger counter has become a major stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 movie "The Bells of Colorado", which features those seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that again? ”
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactivity into minerals."
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name and hence exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch ” stray cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch ” stray cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify stray cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
You can “see ” protein honor in many cancers and then be returned to the body
The test vaccine yields promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify stray cells, ovarium cancer has disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can “watch” protein honor in many types of cancers called HER2, and then return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Cancer Institute of Betezda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 "encourages the growth of several cancers", including breast cancer, ovarium, lungs and colorectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and by ‘ learning them’ how to target cancer cells works when treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp outage, wearing a cap with his motto, after a live performance Saturday night.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast Saturday night after a useless performance lauding US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called Ghost City, in which he wore a hat with an inscription to make America famous again, he began criticizing the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
" Often when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday, evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's legal affairs committee, linked to allegations of sexual assault on Christine Blaise Ford.
Although not broadcast, the video of West's outcry was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him to walk behind the stage because of his cap.
"Behind the scene, I was ridiculed.
They said, “Don’t show up with that drop. ”
They made fun of me!
Then I was told I was in a submerged place, he said, according to Washington Executive.
West continued: "You want to see the submerged place?" said he would "put his superman hat on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments attracted public disdains at least twice, and the crew of the evening show seemed embarrassed, Varajetti reported, a man told the publisher, "The whole studio is dead".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many by performing the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPSAD group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for the support of the crowd. ”
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was its own and it's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for which I believe he accepts and spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kayne West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, also known as Puff Dedi, Puff and P Didi.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dog, has the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist of a previously known prince.
A charge of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder since he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before a senior court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The star of the series Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, attacked toxic manhood.
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they must be firm to be respected.
Speaking to the Sanday Times culture section, Kit said he believes that "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #Now I'm saying.
Kit, who recently married the star of the Game of Thrones, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" on the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we sin with manhood?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic manhood, thanks to powerful male characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, but what is taught?
What do you learn from TV and what on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it is obvious that something is wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the extensions of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he "has ended in battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will be renovating the true West of Sam Sheppard, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a guy who had a love attraction to Keith's character, John Snow, in a fantastic show that won Amy's awards.
The two married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 800,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people suffering from HIV has been reduced to almost zero in this way, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Junan.
From year to year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data presented by a member of staff associated with a Republican party senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiring theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters dismissed accusations Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia lawmakers' pages.
The democracy in Los Angeles has assured that claims are on "ultra-right" sympathizers and websites.
"Lying, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech of Utah.
The information appeared on the internet Thursday, released by an unknown person at Capital Hill while the Senate panel was being held on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court judge.
The information presented appeared shortly after Cavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
The conservative locations such as Gateway Pandite and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publication is linked to Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff has been published, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher.
"These denials are nervous," Fletcher wrote.
"This shows that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He can't ask about the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats related to Judge Cavanaugh, who was indicted by critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also advertised on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent institutions and police of false claims".
"We will allow the offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all of my staff."
The thought of Johnny English attacking again undermined Rohan Atkinson's spy fraud
It is now traditional to look for the elements of Bregzit in every new film with a British connection, and that seems to be true for this restoration of the franchise of fraud, action comedy Johnny English -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Is careful self-speaking of the subject of how obviously we suck up to the new export opportunity of the nation?
Nevertheless, the big - eyed person and many faces of the incompetent Johnny English got a license to “burn” things for the second time — his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinema in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour after a bit resembles Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bean and part of the boy who plays a note from the Kochii song of the fire from the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
Its foundation is the traveller and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclay's now forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor's feathers hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor looks like it's meant for children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy accidents aren't as inventive and focused as the silent tricks on Atkinson's character.
The theme that is being put through all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the disappointment of an agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
On the last chance for a prime minister who is a more pompous and combat figure and already suffers from a complete dissolving of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this character of quasi-Teza-Mei, but there is nothing special about the scenario that would work.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "on black" gives secret agents lessons: there are several good boys here when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English has been rushed to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all things in the Royal Secret Service, they return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bullettova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the perilous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: recast as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a wasteland after they smuggle themselves onto the luxury yacht of Volta; and English starts a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get familiar with the interior of the house of Volta.
All brakes have been removed for the final sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there are plenty of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rohan Atkinson a part that will use his talent?
Labourists deny making plans for British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week -- but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "suits" with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more prone to workers.
The transition on a four-day working week is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A highly ranked party member told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a working week of four days is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary elections campaign.
However, aspirations are not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to grab the power of "the directors without a face" and "professors" in utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could produce "deductions" because of unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the boards of companies and create inclusive property funds, allowing 10 per cent of private companies' capital to belong to employees, who could take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is making a statement about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh might change his mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed his final vote for his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least a week and has been up to date the issue of whether the bureau's findings could change the minds of some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a carved stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
"Anyone she named could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty, will be held in New York City.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendez, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a telephone call or some other useful work that will help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Golbal Citizen because 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-Activism" - people who feel that they are making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activitys" from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to demonstrate commitment and strategies that have collected more than $37 billion and that will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and hints resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementationists, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children exploit their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with insufficient nutrition in the country after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been taken on calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced financing of the project, the power of nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will not succeed.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Fournes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky has discovered, according to Washington's Exzeminer.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria -- namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a front for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the seaways remain open and if necessary by blocking their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinky addressed the participants at an event organised by the Energy Consumers' Alliance, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting it is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing fuels," he said, while talking about Russia as a "one awkward pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" North Tech 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Moscow's "capital" project.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, which is worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of the gas pipeline at 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy procurement," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, said Senator Masacusec
Masacusec senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully consider" whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the town hall in Hollioc, Masacusec, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the city hall and said he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a number of voters in its constituency think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Masacuse's "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Global.
Thirty-two percent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names from the democratic party discussed with the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Pailin is talking about Trek Paylin's post-traumatic rally syndrome at Donald Trump's
Trek Pailin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and indicted in an incident of domestic violence Monday night
"What my son is going through, which he's been going through since he got back, I know how other families feel that are torn apart because of the more traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "return a little different, they return solid, they return and wonder if there is respect for what they and their comrades from the air force, and each other of the military members gave it to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vassile Police.
18 federal states and Washington city support contesting new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents asylum from being given to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington petitioned the court (amicus uriae) in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker challenging politics, En-Bi-Ci News reported.
The prosecutor's full name in the Grace case against parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender, who advocates Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many of the asylum requirements in the United States originate, as nations with constant gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls a decision by the 2014 Migration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public defender, Washington-based Carl Rasin, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of the adoption of laws at the level of federal states, federal and international levels".
"Federal law requires all requirements for asylum to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to a petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that the policy preventing immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Public prosecutor Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges not to asylum victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sashns said in a policy presentation on June 11th.
Azil was never conceived as a solution to all problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby at an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes and choose from their cited objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magneded earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent consecutive minor earthquakes.
Tears came in his eyes when he described the powerful earthquake in the fifth - floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard the wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China for "malignment" with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US daily listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China's paid addition to China's De Moin Register -- the best-selling newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US congress elections on November 6th, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's indictment that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marks among US Reuters services, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington , they are currently in a trade war equating import tariffs with each other.
China's vindictive tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former, longtime governor of Iowa, China's main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda ads in our free press."
"In the demining of propaganda, the government of China abuses the bred American tradition of free speech and free media by posting advertisements in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer of publication" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Republicans step away from women's votes ahead of mid-term elections, over debacle with Cavanaugh, warn analysts
Since many Republicans are not watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already been said to want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no turning back," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said he suspected that pressure to investigate the FBI of Senator Jeff Flake (Republicer of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "Noembru" in a protest in the Senate's hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs commission, decided to proceed with Cavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People already say they are tall; that is true.
But they may be higher, especially among independent women's voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggest there may be negative consequences if republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to EN-BiH news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Cavanaugh will go to the hearing, it's about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that assists in the election of Democrats, the news channel.
However, Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, although most accept the first-time side.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or possibly believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Cavanaugh was likely or definitely lying about the testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations brought by Ford, as well as at least one other, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in front of the Senate's legal affairs committee under oath last week that Cavanaugh in a drunken state attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court judge of showing her the genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Network, begins with a start-up business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrapt, is a company that was built on the open-code platform of Solid, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Internet Data Storage" or a shortenedpod.
It may contain contact lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluk, Sleek and Spotifay all available to one viewer at a time.
What is unique about personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a particular type of information.
The company calls it "personal data reinforcement".
Inrapt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers agreeing to work on the project and community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create decentralised applications by using tools available on Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up a consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Masacusec.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesman in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era on the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A Known Victorian Cross Carrier of World War I · Global Voices
The only priest of the English church to receive a Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received his confession on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellengliss and Lehaukur.
Yet, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military honor.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandkids at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was “an incredible symbolism” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the medal.
According to the London Gazeta, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Channel de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "At a very dense fog and under strong fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the places where the shooting was fired and with “the greatest courage ” led ahead, before attacking the cannon’s nest alone and disabling three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I will never be able to fulfill, but it is something that makes us modest. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor to be part of the parade", and added "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give."
The fans of the combined martial arts remained awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead received Pepa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Belator 206, not having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that was shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6am, Gerard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, and British viewers remained appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they stayed awake until early hours for fighting.
One of the Twitter fans described the transfer of a child cartoon as "a painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6am it was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of Belator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa Pig," yes."
Bellator President Scott Kucker said he would work on a schedule involving British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about playing again, I think we can probably find a solution," Kucker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we transferred, we got a lot of messages and none of them were favorably favored.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we've tried to deliver more because of fans and we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Disks on a Desert Island: Tom Daley feels "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "all are not like me"
Speaking on Radio 4's first edition of the Disks on a deserted island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the longtime Kirsty Young show took several months off because of the disease.
Appearing as a parallel character in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
An Olympic with two bronze medals has become a well-known supporter of LGBT camps and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man -- US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "surprises me".
Daley married the Oscar, who was 20 years old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayly, and Daley said that "all his eyes" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- jumping in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
That also inspired his first choice of song, Heather Small’s Pride — which was in his head in preparation for the Olympics and still made him more difficult.
Disks on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, the horse's out of shape, was on the bench during the Cup Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays at the 47th Cup Ryder game, but will have to change the form to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mikkelson, who plays the biennial event, the record 12th time, was sent to Captain Jim Furik's bench during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being in the center of attention, as the United States has often represented, the five - time winner, he divided the time to cheer and practice his game, the range, in hopes of repairing what was bothering him.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National playground, where far-reaching shocks are a regular precautionary punishment.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth match of Sunday, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in a pair with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start difficult, the game of Michaelson can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the famous and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went like that, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He likes to play, like everyone else."
Mikkelson's gonna go through Nick Faldo's record for the most played games on Cup Ryder on Sunday.
It can be the end of his career in the Raider Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's resourceful, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before individual matches on the final day of Cup Ryder can easily turn into someone else's position.
The Dane debuted at a competition in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the line of the target with only noses", with at least a 14-13-inch lead.
"I remember we had great leadership in Valderama; we had great leadership in Brukline, when we lost and in Walderama, when we won for a little bit," Bjorn, the picturesque, said after watching the class of 2018 win by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're leaving ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play right.
This is not over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players on our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side -- the best players in the world."
He added Bjorn satisfied with the results of his players on a heavy golf course: “I don’t want to give premature assessments on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We have individual games waiting for us tomorrow, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all the abilities as a golfer.
That's the message to be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will require players to play better individually than they played in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was both at the end of the last day's changes, because he was part of the winning team in Brukline before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crvenkovski, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brukline, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment starts in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We set the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McCallroy's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the boys because I think that's how we'll cover everything," Bjorn said of the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated warships from the Cold War, but that will not happen until at least next year due to wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of "Rinland-Faltz", the leading ship of the new class of frigates Baden-Witmberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the daily DiCate, calling for a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014 but the issue after the delivery hampered the fate of an ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wittemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth-technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Other important features include rarer maintenance -- it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans -- will be obsolete by the time they enter the service, according to DiCate.
A frigate with an unfortunate fate F125 reached headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blom and Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy brought the ship back to the shipbuilder after the delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of key "superficial and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because ships from the Baden-Wittemberg class will have crews of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
Reinland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's reduced maritime force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem deteriorated over time, because old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wittemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to bats' secret life
A new study of property in the Scottish mountainous regions is being conducted to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the discoveries will provide answers to the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future protection activities.
A study of the National Trust for Scotland will monitor ordinary and soprano bats, as well as brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
The En-Atch-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all videos will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
A map of habitats will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, an advisor to nature protection at the EN-TI-ES, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain bat forests and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect beds and the loss of dwellings.
Windwinds and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky molds and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their night - hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even founded the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Triv estate in Damfris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He stresses that it is important to check whether there are bats before real estate renovations are done because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or harass their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the bat protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about bats and other species of ours, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo dismissed rape charges, and lawyers will sue Germany's magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, which announced the accusations.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $37,000 not to talk about the incident, Der Spigel said on Friday.
Speaking live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers, hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What has been presented today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything is good," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the accusations they called "inadmissible transfer of doubts from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damage due to "moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the accusations occurred in June 2009 at a hotel and Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the court in the Clark district of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent ” of a“ good boy, ” but he gave in to that “one percent. ”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial agreement because she was afraid of revenge and was concerned "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to amend the treaty because she has injuries from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and moved to Italy's 100m-euro giant Juventus this summer.
Bregzit: Britain "will always mourn" for losing car manufacturers · Global Voices
Britain "will always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Bragzit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britain told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burton, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of Bregzit would cost jobs without an agreement.
The Burton factory -- produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"According to me, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be an end to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, the CEO of the Toyota in Burton.
Other car manufacturers in Britain have voiced concern about how leaving the EU without an agreement will ensure cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-Wee, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risk of the logistics chain in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "right on time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a break at the border that, according to industry, could cause delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory supply at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "rightly done to avoid such border checks".
"We should have an agreement. We should have the best agreement that will allow us not only success in which we will enjoy the present, but we should seize this opportunity," he told the BBC's Radio 4 programme today.
"The evidence not only from the Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Lotto could not say how long the production would have been halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burundi for 24 years and has been a representative of the union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" because the fight over Brett Cavanaugh's nomination as Supreme Court judge continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential violations of the president's laws.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thus endanger Miller's independence, has prompted rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was considering carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with reports released last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash of the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into charges against Kavanaugh, which will further delay the Senate vote.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been established, could be held this week, and could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things are going and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists at the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of briefings are not due to a disincentive towards the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a major impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have considered those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this more often, and you are witnessing that we have been doing it constantly over the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the collected journalists.
Minister for Health by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system concerning fears related to Bregzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire to keep them alive after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, an MP to the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering costs for resolved status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and more widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie under emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive player (linebacker) of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury at the competition Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, chief trainer of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the halftime.
"He came to the side line of the playground and just folded on the ground," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in a stretcher and took it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in red uniform at Tennessee State after the Illinois transfer.
He did a total of five shootings on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 shootings this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
Under Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry expects move to raise up to 120m pounds annually, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide access to housing and focus on high-income people.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds strengthening government efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount, which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120m pounds annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London were purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which led to price increases and caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to engage in this housing purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of offering high prices to land-holding properties, but did not use it and urged Mrs. May to change the quotas for access homes in order to repair the "hamble housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive reforms in housing, including housing controls and ending evictions for no good reason.
He also wants advice to give them greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the return of the British dream, i.e. to make life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes in as easy a way as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland" · Global Voices
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" was in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league with only three points less than the club on top.
This summer, he moved to "The Stadium of Light" after bringing "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told Scotland's "Sportsound" on "BBC".
"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I am successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager are Dick Lawyers, David Moses, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the Prime Minister's League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it no doubt belongs to the Prime Minister's League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross has been working as a manager for only three years, in which he entered his career since working as chief's assistant at Dumberton and after 15 months of engagement as part of the coaching staff of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the third league drop and returned St. Mirren from losing the title in next season's championship.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls taking over Alloa.
"I honestly believed that career as a manager is the right choice for me, a better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough money and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever during my entire adult life."
You can hear the whole "Sportsouund" interview on Sunday, September 30th at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (Britain Summer Time)
According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs that are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "Suntime and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of pubs increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants decreased significantly.
The decline in the sale of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has worsened further during July.
The pubs and bars that mostly sell beverages have seen much more growth compared to previous years compared to restaurants where decline was observed.
Pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the sun’s periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for rest and hospitality from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly devastating as a complement to the current pressures that generate costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for local owners who mostly sell food and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the much needed relaxation."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in publishing new brands.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker" device to monitor sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same 47 operational groups with a combined income of over 9 billion pounds and is a established rapper for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents
A study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media profile that hides from their parents and teachers
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News increases fear that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” profile that they showed their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has created a social media profile that hides from adults.
The survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile that they showed their parents, while having other private profiles.
A mother who happened to find her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile came across a teenager who asked others "to rape him."
The study conducted by Digital Aware UK and The Headsmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" of the "Scottish Athletics" board
Elyd Doyle was elected executive director of the Scots Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished athlete in Scotland and President Ian Byty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience acquired over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has great respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board," Byty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide sports in Scotland."
An American who won the titles of 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Games in 1996, besides winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games and now appearing regularly as a commentator of the BBC, could not go after suffering a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show whether I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was arduous, but I was able to recover completely, again I can walk and practice agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump commercial where mothers are compared to cows causes division of opinions on the Internet
A breast pump company caused a division of opinions on the Internet when it announced a commercial in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be “the world’s largest breast pump, ” the user-oriented technology company Elvie published a ridiculous commercial inspired by music videos to display the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of haystacks whose lyrics sound like this: “Yes, I milk milk, but you don’t see a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed these aren’t snakes, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts. ”
However, the commercial that was published on the company's Facebook page has caused Internet controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the dairy industry's "horribles".
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to become pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children steal from them only a few days after they give birth," one of the comments reads.
The Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into the breast milking bra (‘Elvie’/ ‘Mother’)
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A really inappropriate ad."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really “funny. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I would have bought a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
The milking made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a genius product," one of the comments read.
Another comments: “This is a fun ad designed for mothers who milk milk (often in their jobs or in toilets) and feel like“ cows. ”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR at Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is indeed a revolutionary product and deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who are milking milk and dairy cows, we wanted milking using a pump and the challenges it brings to the attention of the same, displaying the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump carries in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on a fashion track for designer Martha Yakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly even though crossing the border at monthly level has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to bear fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official last week testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees do not have a previous criminal record.
"Specially 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' family are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order for cases with children to be processed faster, authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them will be required to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as asylum workers say the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to present their case of legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are thought to be impeccable to obtain relief will immediately be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which could lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the past few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely to ignore signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time for them to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends may increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and "will be treated appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on this country's territory destroyed by war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some from Western countries" of "expanding irrational fears" that move refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with assistance for reconstruction until political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that the military action will be directed towards jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem identified the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump will win second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential mandate is cut early by impeachment and scandal, which is likely to be much of the liberalists.
In what will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale in the presidency that has ever been seen!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the strike-time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and has almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when important news is announced.
"This is like a fire people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designated Survivors" drama of ABC for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skovel, a veteran in comedy writing and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking in the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skol told me.
There's a certain amount of fun in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case versus Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been looking at a panel of experts who debate the use of a $15,000 "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a leather bomber jacket from Paul Manafort's Noah (a dress of thick arrogance), as he called "The Washington Post" and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking descriptions of anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and what gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show is that every night he brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's rotating show and daily turns (carriers with NFL, praises for Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fly this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC as he recorded on CNN.
He couldn't stop looking, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was critical.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Inflow of external funds in the narrowest mid-term race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Congress Area receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganisation of congress areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is being run by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won second place in last spring's extraordinary elections.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kit Rotfus, who currently represents the old 12th Congress area, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Congress area.
The maps have been amended since the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas have been manipulated in favour of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congress area is a difficult competition to finance campaigns among the main party sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congress Committee for Campaigns (‘DCCC’) and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee (‘NRCC’).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the 18th congressional elections in Pennsylvania in March, which were characterized by wide media coverage.
For more than a decade this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador for support for China, and then quits
Diplomatics stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a friendly meeting in June 2017 with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the management team of Trump's organisation.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only with regard to El Salvador, penalties were taken into account, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included reducing financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have an adverse impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and murder rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they want the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any reflection on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Penses is scheduled to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the state of anonymity internally.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing you can do is post a report by special advisor Robert Miller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly pointing his investigation towards the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the assembly of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to re-emerge in front of voters, and possibly before a jury of his colleagues.
There are many insecuritys here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it for his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What do we do if Mr. Trump resigns to Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in the hot seat after the newspaper announced that last year he suggested secretly filming the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the function he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"What will we do if Brett Cavanaugh's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle-term elections for a Congress that Mr. Trump will accuse?
If we fail all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe it will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish girl from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for Sabbath at a table with a swastika logo.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of the Rangers with an optimistic stand before the clash with "Rapid Vienna"
The Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while they are aware of the fact that after the game's unresolved game against Willarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorence, the middle-class player due to knee injuries, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unsolved game 2-2 with "Villerreal", but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for greater achievements.
"That was a good point for us because Willarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We have entered the game believing that we can achieve something and have returned with a points won.
We may have been able to give a little more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
Another great European night awaits us on Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll fight back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, or my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor in the site.
The team's good and the boys really enjoy it; training's good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women can't sleep at night because of this pension-saving fear
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their marriage mates about long - term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not share your wishes with them prematurely.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be given because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Please include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of cash value, which can help you cover your expenses or secure your own funds if you have them.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out the full power of healthcare so that you can empower a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also consider your financial resources with full authority.
In this way we would choose a person of confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he is taking and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asks.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?

A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from his exit.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (Britain summer time) as "a random act".
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are appealing to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, relief workers cannot obtain information from Dongala County, a region north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Several key facts continue about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 miles (180 miles) on the coast of the northwestern part of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy of Central Sulavesi, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit and west Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is found in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Ascheh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of the Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of the city of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of the city of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawa, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached up to 10m and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake hit the Pydi Jaya County in Aceh, causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen structures.
2018: Big earthquakes hit the tourism island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Matt-Su detention facility with an opportunity to exit if he pays $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when he was asked how to plead before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to prison for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, and I have fined a day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time you've filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case at Alaska's Veteran Court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in a report on the crime of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he supposedly hit her on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after saying her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulavesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media is circulated by videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for suspect in New York terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sifoulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence not committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle route on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan and run over the pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to a report of the intention to seek the death penalty delivered in the South District of New York.
According to court documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death sentence on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed a 22-based indictment against Saipov, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
To carry out the attack required "detailed planning and intent," prosecutors said, with the manner in which Saipov carried out it described it as "huge, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Hamibulajevic Saipov caused, injuries, damages and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laure Decath, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," according to the state's report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death sentence case was prosecuted in South New York County.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 grounds of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders represented by Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilt and sentence life without the possibility of release will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tori party MP says NJEL PHARAZ should be in charge of Bragzit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Tori party's conference pledged to "mobilize the people's army".
Former party leader Ukip said politicians must "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's lawmakers proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn on the march in Birmingham said the United Kingdom would have been "out of the EU" by now if Mr. Farage had been a secretary to Bregzit.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in terms of unifying her deeply divided members was highlighted by the counter-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bregzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Cekers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregzit individuals, counter-Bregzit persons and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bonn said at the "Leave Means Leave" pro-Bregzit gathering in Solihal that he wanted to "refuse the plan from the Checkers".
He suggested Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now," he said.
The Lawmaker from Welingborough added, "I will support Bragzit, but we must reject the Checkers plan."
Voicing his stance against the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars so that we could be subjected now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people changed their minds and wants to stay in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: "I am simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who are due to our victory in the elections.
Please give up the checkers plan and listen to us."
In a targeted message to Mrs. May, she added, "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said at the assembly that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to hand over Bragzit, and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of handing over Bragzit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the nation's army of this country that has enabled us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit faces marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly downtown.
After the group's gathering, a small number of activists who wore banners with the inscription "Torievci vs. Bregzit" appeared this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked conservatives about security issues they faced at the opening of the conference on the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for the border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Bragzit," he added.
Warren plans to think hard about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think well about running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe announced that a Democratic Party of Massachusetts representative was talking about his future during the Western Massachusetts city assembly this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's November reelection against Republican party representative Jeff Dil, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Hollioc was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump came to the presidency, where he uses a city assembly format.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes putting women at the top."
Suspect arrested for shooting and death of basketball player Simms from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU team was arrested Friday.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11am Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result of it died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to "247sports".
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, owned a weapon, and fired at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Eastern Baton Rouge police department.
As a 192-centimeter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played in 32 matches with 10 performances last season, i.e. on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 catch balls per match.
Gran Prie of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to world title after the team gives his orders to win over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in the lurch as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered the boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing ring a round later and came behind the Bethel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action that forced Ferrari's driver to reluctantly leave the inside of his free risk of staying on the side after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back row of the network and ended in seventh place on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
Then he led the majority of the race and directed the tires to his car so he could quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimmy Raiconen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing of the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the other eight rounds, so Raiconen came to fourth place.
Today is a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has made a truly exceptional decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestein at Saturday's rally about her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassi Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "awful and rude and dishonest".
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and evil and insolent and insolent," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks of information and they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finestein, did you release this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it-- No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Finestein regarding charges against Cavanaugh by Ford as early as July, and it was released in early September, but Finestein denied that the leak of information came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish her story," Finestein told the committee, "The Hill said.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at Saturday’s rally: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body talk.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their malice, their debauchery, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to step on to get their power and control back," the president said as the "Mediaite" said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in the match against "Dundee"
Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League competition Friday against the "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 match in Dundy on Saturday.
"Giants" took advantage of two goals that Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
François Bushar equaled "Dundee" to Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to ensure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season within the Elite League for Adam Kefi's boys, who retaliated with the victory over the "Dundee" 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, that is, at 3:35 p.m. with the addition of Kendall McFol, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan provided host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercard assisted Kaoney to achieve the 15-16 score.
Dwyer made sure that Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regroups and Bushard returns them with a powerful game and goal, resulting in 27:37.
Kaoney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time secure Dundee's leadership in the competition late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in half of the final period of the fifth match.
"Giants", who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next home court game in Milton Canes on Friday.
A flying controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
A flying controller in Indonesia has been famous as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed, and many have disappeared since a major earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong successive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in ruins in the city of Palu.
But while his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the post at Mutiara's Sis Al-Jufrey Airport in Palu, which was constantly shaking.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's plane with flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Syrait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be taken to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many can't even be accessed," said the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached up to six metres destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Quiet assistance carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimarkets everywhere have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
President of Indonesia Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Minnesota: "Air Niugini" now says a man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated on the plane that fell into the lagoon in the Pacific now says that a man had disappeared after saying earlier that the 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated by the plane they were sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to cross the water that reached their half and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port reconstruction also helped rescue, with the help of an inflatable ship carrying people to the coast before the plane went down in about 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in aircraft accidents registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
A analyst established a time frame the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of being burned alive by a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the US justice ministry, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted the jury's use of phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Teles was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, said "The Clarion Ledger".
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that for some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to refute this genre's negative attitude by including positive messages in its music.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop has strayed from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their resuscitation through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?!
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York nanny sued a married couple for being fired on the grounds of discrimination after getting a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was “another black woman. ”
The couple deny being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016, after the first day of work of the new nurse, Giselle Morris, learned that she was black.
"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!" Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "uncomfortable" Mrs. Morris had fired her, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, had done her job badly and had expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, said "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the married couple and demanding compensation for the $350-a-day layoff for a six-month period, an engagement that will involve her living with the family, what she was initially hired to do, but without a deal.
"I want to show them that these things should not be done," she told Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple returned the charges of being racist, saying Mrs. Morris's dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you trust your children to the face you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying the lawsuit was "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the couple to social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, stated regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book first before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington's huge success.
After saying that her father who worked as a cameraman for "BBC" before getting inspired to write the book from a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work hadn't been well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But since you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him although success is not due to yourself.
I think Paddington's success was taking it that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
"Nad called to tell me regularly that the situation is very bad and that it is expected not to survive," said Mrs. Edon-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications given to her by doctors to maintain the pump of her heart slowly decreased and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
All I had to do was sit around and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm."
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz mourned her daughter's loss boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are making efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as a contagious smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother who was 11 years old was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear it will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you need to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the day of Christmas when children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye at all and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death is a huge trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “This kind of thing destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must keep going and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain after the FBI has launched the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time investigation, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is "disintegrating" under the rooted partisan state.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is due only to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, that is, on November 6th and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the draw and enter the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers "reduced" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Bjeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, said there were 1,127 crossings at the border last year compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher human smuggler tariffs are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees eventually gain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean people have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and which can be easier to cross compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them into force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stalemate of the negotiations on denuklearisation.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of stagnation in progress since then on Saturday.
"If there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security either, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first," Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "histeric" and said that if his temper is taken into account he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassi Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional about his opening exposure, sometimes even shouting and crying while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has proved to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to take Cavanaugh off the post if the allegations against him are confirmed and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she is concerned about possible verdicts that Kavanaugh will bring against the Law on Accessing Health Care or Roy versus Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Cavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "It's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger that she can't free from without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued, “A woman who had performed an executive post somewhere helped me, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misread.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated was when I once started crying with unspeakable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager who always had a certain fear, grabbed me by my neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach out to you."
Patricia Schroeder was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marry affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"It was not a well thought out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign was launched long ago, she did not have enough funding, so she promised not to enter the race if she did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 each would only give her $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During a speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, or thanks to people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you had seen me, you would have probably thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to the event.
"You would have thought that Klinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war can be a good thing for Beijing
Opening the fire with the beginning of the US-China trade war was deafening, although the battle is far from over, the clash between countries can be useful for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning early this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation has escalated significantly during this week with the introduction of a new $200 billion-dollar tariff for goods (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing returned to nature each time, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, US trade war pressures can result in positive support for China in the long term as the interdependence of the two economies will decrease.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden decline from an economic perspective in any country is much more dangerous than previously established by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the New American Security Centre, which is a tink tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee returns, foreign minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has remained devastated since the long war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renovate the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that reflected on their daily lives.
The UN estimates more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed the aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe score a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a European field and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe has regained its primacy since Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, directed the ball into the water in a couple-3 to the 16th hole while losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was prominent in all the rounds, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 after the tournament began to organise in the current format in 1979.
USman Jordan Spitt lost with a score of 5:4 to the European team's lowest ranking player, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant of eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the 25.5-point tournament during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
It's been really hard this year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," the emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He now gives way to his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday one-to-one beat Tiger Woods, the American legend of golf, with a score of 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
It's about the amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking for Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has been working all weekend to direct the game to low- grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his team's disappointing game said "I'm proud of these guys, they were really fighting.
During one time this morning, we gave the team a hard time from Europe.
We fought.
He's hating down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Association of Professional Golfers and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it to them.
We've been outplayed.
