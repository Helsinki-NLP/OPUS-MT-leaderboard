Welsh congregation members worry that they are “muppet-like”
Some members of the Assembly are appalled by the suggestion that they should be named MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly throughout the political spectrum are worried about being ridiculed.
A member of the assembly from among Labour’s ranks said they were concerned “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means silly and pwp means poop.
Plaid Cymru, a member of the assembly, said their group as a whole was “not happy” and suggested other options.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but warned that there was little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to present name changes, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for the members of the Assembly will of course have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Assembly was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
The name "Welsh Parliament Member" or "WMP" was chosen by the Commission as the members of the Assembly, but the public consultation received the most support from the "MWP" option.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for presiding official Elin Jones, who must submit draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of members of the Assembly and the creation of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take part in the debate on the legislation in the final vote on their designation.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The aim of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as churches in Harlem face problems
“The older people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one or the other today.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are different now.
Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly frequent.”
With churches, however, he worries that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back at the beginning again.
He added that the churches could be replaced with residential buildings with a common administration (condominium) where people will live who will not help the shelters in the neighborhood that remain.
“The vast majority of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will quickly come when all these churches will close, as it is unlikely that the people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community performing worship services nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black religious community led by the venerable John Howard Johnson, who, on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, led a boycott of vendors who refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they ordered rushing bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “bells for poor people.”
The expert, who rushed in in July, called them a little different: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these were the first chimes to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who 18 years ago went to Riverside Church, where he rushes to larger chimes.
Mr Merriweather said he had not been replaced at St Martin’s Church.
In the past few months, St. Martin’s Church has been running a complex story with architects and contractors; some brought in by church laity and others by the diocese.
In July, the sacristy, an administrative body of the parish composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese to worry that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about transparency from the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old man while hunting lobster in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters as the lobster hunting season opened.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream for help, and then he and the group swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited about catching the lobster, and then he realized he was screaming “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had torn his entire clavicle.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Capt. Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
Those responsible blocked access for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty spots like they have in department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of its entry into the UK beauty market, which is worth 2.8 billion GBP and is still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are falling, larger beauty spots will be tested in 11 stores across the country and more stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves that were previously used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its product portfolio to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees range will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of beauty products, so most products are vegan - something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding of.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO at Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, boosting food sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the relationship ended after a dispute over sharing profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical company to Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago for GBP 125 million.
Lloyds said it would play a role in the plan as it expanded its range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty spots to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby steps down from 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den (Good Business) is furious that TV host Holly Willoughby has pulled out of the 11 million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand of clothing and accessories Truly.
The company has been compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram, that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons star Dan Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand deal at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when a gold girl on television admitted Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and forecast to double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would live for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely astounded everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening, because the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which was among the most interesting associations for banks in Britain, the company would cost millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, as well as additional delays in opening.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as president in March.
The pair vacationed together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about criticism of the media for commenting on what some see as “non-presidential” and a positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, with his mocking “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting, which Trump described as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea does not see a "adequate response" from the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing to impose sanctions to keep pressure on the country.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results: halting missile testing, helping to free hostages, and bringing home the remains of U.S. servicemen.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravage the island, hundreds dead
For example, in dealing with the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok residents were resettled, they did not declare a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, they have been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so the situation is a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear if foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes are a constant in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared for the fury of nature.
Aceh has built shelters after the tsunami, but on other coasts this is not common practice.
The loss of life was probably due to the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was in place.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands even in the best of times is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help victims of the earthquake, is heading towards Palu, but will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for the Joko administration in re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from long-running tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hits for late tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in the 89th minute against Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's pass a good 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal in the 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left and fired a shot at the distant gate.
The shot traveled high above the penalty area towards the right upper corner of the door.
The ball eventually went down through goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into goal.
“I was simply trying to get in the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as far as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much more and just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time with a goal from Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this action, the striker of the Blues gave the ball back to Mateo Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith passed quickly in the middle and ran forward.
Then he gave a nice pass through the defense and Hazard ran into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defense and shot with his left foot at a distant gate through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings due to Friday's magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which triggered six-meter waves.
Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is littered with the ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling everyone who was in the area and saw or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I call on anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on the car camera footage, to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police representative confirmed the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene of the crime who thought they knew the woman and asked where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police are informing family members of the woman.
The cab driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told it may take several hours before they can re-enter.
Officers heard him explain to the man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one was just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to write to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, citing the September 30th diary.
Cromwell’s statue in parliament has become the latest memorial to the dispute over the “rewriting of history”
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal “nonsense” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate over the removal of the statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell neither commissioned nor implemented.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor of the last century.
The splendid presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of a historiography for a personality that some still believe is worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more so in the late 19th century than today) as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an accurate picture is a matter of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from his days as a protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, she and her cousin arrived from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody muzzle in the pigsty.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig killed a farmer to death.
“The brother’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” the cousin was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been jailed so as not to attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's management are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of porcine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with the man suffering severe physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig had squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then the wife drove the animal away.
After eating an Oregon farmer in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“We just want to play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
“We just need to show them a fair amount of respect,” he said.
Heavy rains arrive in the southwest of the United States due to the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and is weakening.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has been a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 137 km/h since Sunday morning at 5.00 am and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low air pressure is strengthening above the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, which will mix with the low air pressure zone, will create heavy rainfall in the wider southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris deposition, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, precipitation in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Flooding is possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching area of low air pressure will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
Precipitation above 12 mm is possible, which can result in less debris deposition and slippery roads.
This will be the first rains for the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday early morning, and late Monday and Tuesday the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rains will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be high temperature fluctuations in the United States, as the Arctic cools and tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
There is a 20 degree difference between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will enter a warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, we could have 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good chances for temperatures above the US average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks an interesting testimony Thursday from Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault, which was alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued as television stations cut off regular programming due to Friday's last-minute reversal: a deal forged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI conducts a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was groping her and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to witness Friday’s testimony.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble counting the number of viewers watching the program in the offices.
For the sake of simplicity, the ratings are similar to those of the American Film Academy’s football game finals or awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, is leading the way for all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen reports.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that it would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, CNN and CBS television cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He glanced down for a few minutes at CNN’s live cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office made the statement, adding that he would tell more at the committee hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks also broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh's appointment to a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as called for by the minority Democratic Party.
Flake was partly persuaded by talks with fellow Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused of 'playing political games' in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said the suggestion that Britain and the EU pay tariffs to each other was “completely absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dytheon Simpson, Suspect in Death of LSU Team Player
Police arrested the suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to police from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said he lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses at the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television complements the WAFB television reports.
After the Simpsons interrogation, police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
An East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
To assist in the investigation that led to the arrest, the police thank the Louisiana State Police's Special Fugitive Unit, the State Police's Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the area.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their “concern and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 201-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU head coach Will Wade said the team was "shaken" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash on Mexico City
The ash, vomited by the Popocatepetl volcano, reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunder and earthquake surges.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City's capital, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarised secession vote.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, held back by riot police, tossed eggs at them and threw paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
There were later clashes, with officers having to use batons to stop the fighting.
Proponents of independence, who chanted “no forgetfulness, no forgiveness” for hours, faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media, 14 people suffered minor injuries in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which supports independence, remain.
The overwhelming majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region in violent clashes.
Groups supporting independence camped in front of polling stations overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take another route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of making Catalonia independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I watched my parents cry because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite important, albeit close, victories in the regional elections last December, the independence-supporting Catalan parties have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the best-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used a phone to record a protest in support of police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“To run in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen with the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested for crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 7.30pm UK summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow would also be fired at the car.
With Menga's goal, Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga scores first goal for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard only had to concede his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as the Gary Holt team tied with the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team was thus left with no victory in the away games of this year's championship, and the following Sunday they are waiting for Hearts, who lead the league and behind by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his undefeated streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste defeat.
Livingston wasted chances against direct guests
Holt’s team should have led well before the goal, as they were causing many problems with their directness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to get through, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow struck past the door, and Craig Halkett shot over the goal with his head.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, as they knew they could be dangerous to the guests in the break in the attack.
And that’s how they came up with the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared the action for Menga to shoot and score from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had more ball possession, but home defense could not break through and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much to do.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked Scott Pittman's shot, and Lithgow fired past goal from another Livingston stoppage in the attack.
Motions continued to come into Livingston's box, but the home team rebuffed all of the attacks, with two misdemeanors - Halkett's misdemeanor over Glenn Middleton's replacement and a misdemeanor for the handball game - but the referee did not rule.
'Great show' by Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the lineup have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he has awakened the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and deployed a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert at all times.
Rangers, however, simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard’s leadership, they are sorely lacking in these standards.
There were no shots on goal - only once they successfully beat the hosts' defense - and this is a kind of wake-up call for Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters - many of them Kurds - who do not support Erdogan's government have also voiced their opinions, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect a split over a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and despised by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist fatally crashes into car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near a junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford in the south-east of the city at around 10.15am UK summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred just months after the cyclist died in a collision in which the driver of the car escaped, namely on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday's accident.
Police said police were checking the man’s identity to inform family members.
Roadblocks were erected and bus lines diverted, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in the incident in a heavily guarded men's prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at the HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30am UK summer time and is still going on.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were called in to attend an incident involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A representative of the prison staff said: “We have called specially trained personnel to take care of the incident at the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be taken away by the police and may be further behind bars as a result.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, the prison warden was reported to have been in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a riot police unit was called to the prison to intervene in a violent riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for arid areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa makes its way through the southwest desert and carries the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to storm Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged 60 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitations of up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, 25 to 50 mm of precipitation is expected, with single precipitations of up to 100 mm possible.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as a dry period is currently taking place in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drought Tracking Center, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still has the strength of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and weakens.
It is expected to reach land in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a major flood risk.
“We expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation from the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora with the possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” Weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the Baja Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the U.S. southwestern desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can be caused by life-threatening sudden flooding and debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00am UK summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area at night, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are urging anyone who may have caught the action on their mobile phone to report it.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the infamy and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against ruthlessness and outrageous Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the indignation and anger” of the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of service to the public,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really trying to run,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says Democrats are on a mission of “resisting and hindering.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican party adviser told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them washed away by the huge waves that pushed offshore.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as six-meter waves struck the coast at dusk, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency, told a meeting in Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, he knocked everything down,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photos released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, should further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely cut off and they have no information from the Donggala area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the top floor can be heard screaming to warn people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall hit the shore and took buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosbe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where employees in the courtyard set up a shelter from the tarpaulins in front of their premises, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of devastation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to come to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and assistance of personnel are only allowed if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That's never happened before.
“It’s still considered a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing cling to the hope that their near-miracles are in sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an adult in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how, in the hours when news of the Roa Roa hotel crash circulated around the paragliding community, she desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey tick instead of two blue ones.
“I don’t think that means the messages have been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security worker who was filling up an ATM in the Newport on the Leeve center.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “came up to a Brink’s employee from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses reportedly saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not give an exact number of participants.
Anyone with information on the suspects' identities should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “A creature with the official name Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it for the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "personal reasons," the show's creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, referring to the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you and I am all of you.
I turned Kanye, which means “the only one,” into Ye, reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former associate of West's, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without a dash, and in capital letters.
Mexican President Amlo vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements were beginning to operate in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly grants to students and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal groups.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in the field, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are well behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will happen in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, chairman of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial and
In the 1980s, Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American game actor Othello, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as a robotics competition organized by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when he would be next to find the next visionary more easily.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard to get government support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes on the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired the best of universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people with an AI PhD should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrower artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create the National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has done nothing for months.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that opposed their application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The government reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 percent absent as long as it was necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by agreeing a deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško cast their ballots in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia on a name change that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He added that a positive outcome would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is less than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57% of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
For a referendum to succeed, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government, which took office last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero overplayed Brighton's entire defence and scored
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defence at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero's score in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
At the start of the action, the Argentine striker accepted a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players and found an open space.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the others at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed Sterling to his left.
The English striker returned the ball with his first touch in the penalty area to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is facing problems in his legs,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to get a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues their initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball a few times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the distant gate.
The blue striker pushed the ball into the net just before it passed the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals are out of the game, so there's no reason for another attack.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the pitcher's hill against the Colorado Rockies. This will only happen if the Rockies still have opportunities to play in the finals, because in the Western League, the game have advantages over the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday to secure at least an invitation from the organizer, but are still waiting for their first division title.
“While we can’t get anything out of it, at least we’ll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will be playing at probably the highest level this year.
“Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals haven't released the name of the first Sunday's pitcher, but it's likely to be Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first to pitch for the 34th time, was a relief player on Thursday and would have had enough rest days by Sunday.
The Washington right-hander picked up 18 wins and 7 losses this season with an average of 2.53 runs allowed and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 turnovers this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It will be one of the biggest - I'm really trying to run, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “We have this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening right now.
They're determined to regain power using every means possible, and you can see the impertinence, the meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats are on a mission of “resisting and hindering.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, mean, and lying.”
He named a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn’t, wait. It was really bad body language, the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She is impatient with those who express their opinions.
When a Momentum activist in my local party told me he didn’t trust me, it wasn’t a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who are not welcome to express their opinion.
The same thing happened to my fellow Member Joan Ryan because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of no confidence to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for Friday's meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years that I have been a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday meetings have mostly been just that.
Unfortunately, such a tone is not used at most meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views within the Labour Party are not admissible and it is assessed at each opinion whether this is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with - be it in the area of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-choice, condemn the politics of the environment, and tell me I shouldn't be in a Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments intended for me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but they are not allowed to be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how abuse rates have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to differing opinions, and with each motion of censure or change in the rules for selection, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the last two years, I have received a lot of advice on how to keep my head down and not be so loud, and I will be “all right.”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago - the negligence of Thatcher's government that caused the classroom in my elementary school to literally collapse - I have tried, as a local councillor or government minister, to advocate for better public services for those who need them most.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused because of my political views and areas on which I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste their time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threats of non-choice or political appropriateness will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament from the Nottingham East party.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr to the top of the scale
Two late attempts have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully entertaining championship game of the day.
They are now at the top of the rankings and are the only unbeaten team out of ten.
In the end, their top defense and better exploiting opportunity overcame the balance, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through a lot of tests so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayr team, they have taken better chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal converted by Frazier Climo led Ayr into the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, received in the game with the Warriors, was a numerical advantage for Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted the attempt without conversion.
Climo increased his lead for Ayr at the foul, before scoring at half-time and then converted a solo attempt to score 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long interruption due to serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and following on, Ayr was promoted with a Stafford McDowall attempt, converted by Climo.
Temporary captain Ayr Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with a player over with Bruce Colvine's unconverted attempt at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted a shot from David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry in a fifth attempt at the hosts.

The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran apparently goes into the catering business,as he is supposed to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old on the BBC's popular series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the upcoming ninth season the finale, and Kiernan seems to already be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.

“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
There are navy blue flags on public buildings.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive - just like the yearning to refloat the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the greatest after decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court, which will receive it on October 1 after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, awaits the result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the international court on large screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia's access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court won't rule in Bolivia's favor -- and even if it did, it wouldn't change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Bolivia Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICJ ruling comes just six months after hearing the closing arguments means that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zirate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the last four years are not talking in favor of Bolivia, but they may cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” said Zaratej.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric sucked all the goodwill out of the Chileans that might still be there, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to take part in the discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime issue as a political foothold.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“Deciding is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never be the first to destroy its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to its promises at a meeting between the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently ahead of a resumption of nuclear diplomacy that was deadlocked more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong to think that continuing sanctions and objecting to the announcement of an end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about making the announcement without Pyongyang first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons, which the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris Reveal the Latest Line of Huge Headdresses Coming to Affordable Brand Stores Near You
To complement your collection of headgear or to hide completely from the sun, you do not have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne in their collections for spring and summer 2019 revealed a collection of quirky oversized covers that dazzled the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
The Valentine's piece that stood out the most was a hat in beige with wide shorts, decorated with feathers-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories have included watermelons with precious stones, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they won’t keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter's mask than high fashion.
One was similar to snorkeling equipment and glasses, and the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant headgear will come to stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow “La Bombi,” a straw hat with 60-centimeter shorts was seen on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that flooded social networks sent another big creation through the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit she was wearing.
At Paris Fashion Week, a raffia bag in burnt orange trimmed with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the central piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer - because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for oversized accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: language skills are key for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam scores, further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desired elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation is imprinted on his memory.
But if you speak to a person in his mother tongue, the words are imprinted on his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results from recent exams show that languages top the rankings with the highest success rates in independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who learned a foreign language scored excellent.
Data collected in 74 Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) member schools showed that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent grade in Mandarin and 72% of pupils in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as optional subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons why employers struggle to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Knowledge of languages is therefore becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
For future job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, whatever career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically takes precedence over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to talk, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By knowing several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by specialists in this field in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that equips and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his San Diego debut Sunday at Lakers
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's going to play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the Lakers official website.
Lakers official Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games ahead of the season.
“At this stage in my career, I don’t need a pre-season game,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including stops in his pro-government states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nominee still unconfirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia and where can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, prompting confirmation in the Senate expected to be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of caucuses is to help Republicans, who face major elections in November, gain new momentum.
That’s why, in President Trump’s campaign, these five rallies are dedicated to “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult campaign season,” a Trump campaign official told Reuters.
Supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s convention at the Wesbanco Arena center in Wheeling, according to West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract interest from Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in opinion polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s a bad sign that the president needs to come and ‘raise’ him in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA still wants to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday’s singles matches
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon duels of two doubles (foursome) may have been what the Ryder Cup needed this year.
The swing pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the pendulum swing now?
“They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so it’s probably a new momentum for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of leading by four points, with 12 more to go.
But according to Spieth, Americans feel the wind in their sails, as well as being encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the green and sets a good example.
The screams of luck continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when he and Thomas tied the fourth game after two points behind.
The punch, which won them the 15th hole, was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but charming two of Europe won four points out of four and are unmistakable.
The Molliwoods were the only ones not to be hit by a boogie on a Saturday afternoon, and the boogies were also avoided on a Saturday morning, a Friday afternoon, and by the last nine holes on a Friday morning.
Such a game and the way the energy seems to flow between them and the noisy audience is confirmed by the fact that they are the players that will have to be beaten on Sunday, and no other player could have sealed Europe’s possible victory better than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Or maybe both at the same time in different places.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to the buggy and two double buggies on the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swedes fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
On Saturday, the players will not be able to help.
Games with four balls and duels of two doubles is interesting to follow closely because of the communication between couples, the tips they give themselves, the tips they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can be changed in an instant.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage before the last day, but the duels between the two teams have shown that the team of the United States also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes into the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's games with four balls and duels of two doubles lead 10-6 against the United States.
The excellent couple, consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave their best and with two wins over Tiger Woods and at the Le Golf National field earned four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is striving to win the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, had a four-ball advantage over the American team that sinned in the morning games, leading in the series with 3:1.
The U.S. team resisted better in the duels of two doubles, where they won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (a pair nicknamed "Molliwood") are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they again proved themselves and even more convincingly beat the worn-out Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball bouts and two doubles bouts, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning's four-ball games, returned for two doubles matches and, paired with Henry Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopka, who were ranked first and third in the world rankings, by 2 and 1.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, they won decisively against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in two doubles matches, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team come back four points behind in individual matches, although Furyk's team only needs a tie to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem like too much of a bite for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will not unilaterally disarm”
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing mistrust in the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho told the World Body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken a number of “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, undermining the city for nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we don’t see the right response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in national security, and under such conditions we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea for taking gradual measures, his statement was significant because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader, held on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to pursue “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not give in to calls to release the tough international sanctions that apply to North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that we must first disarm ourselves nuclear, increases pressure with sanctions to achieve our goals by coercion, and even objects to the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The thought that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president outlined at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that had taken place over the past five months, adding: “If we had discussed the nuclear disarmament problem with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have ended at such a deadlock.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from that of last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the mainland of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations, but said he still has a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timeline, saying: “It could take two years, three years, or five months - it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue unabated until we recognize the full, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions on North Korea to cut off funding for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, and North Korea criticized him hours later for calling his demands “gangster-like.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to take down the missile testing station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
Mr. Moon said Mr. Kim’s “appropriate measures” included security guarantees promised by Mr. Trump in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s Harvard University course is to teach all undergraduates how to get more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing macho culture of “all-night” learning, where power accumulates with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students of the world’s best universities often don’t know the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is after him the first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said, “Why do I only find out now that I am in my senior year?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, held for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sports success, as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, says they opted for such a course when they found that students significantly lacked sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a student’s home door, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student village with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarette smoking affects their health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with “all-night learning”, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, present growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight - the brain goes into a mode of hunger due to lack of sleep, which makes students constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, Raymond So, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professor’s lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that in the next stage, postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study programme before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock for sleep as well as waking up. He also wants to alert them to the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED-lighting, as they can cause an imbalance of the circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga sinks Gerrard team's hopes
Rangers again defeated in the away game: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared Steven Gerrard's team doomed to defeat by 1: 0.
The Ibrox team had their first away win since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone Stadium, but Gary Holt's team had scored a second defeat in 18 games since Gerrard's lead, leaving his Scottish League team 8 points behind.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half was over, but the Rangers' selection did not give the impression that he wanted to equalise.
With this, Rangers fell to a frequent place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals lagged, however, the team Hibernian
The Rangers' troubles were not over yet, and Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when an item from the visiting team's fan site reportedly flew in.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the crew that easily beat Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified Livingston Eleven, which had taken a point off the Hearts team the week before, and was undoubtedly impressed with how his run-of-the-mill team had effectively neutralized all of the guest attempts.
Rangers had a higher ball possession, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came as soon as two minutes after Meng found Scott Pittman with his first short pass, who then went on to score a goal from Allan McGregor, but the midfielder was imprecise in the performance and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free-kick then reached captain Craig Halkett, but the ball was then missed by his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that a penalty shot should have been awarded after the collision with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, but referee Steven Thomson suppressed the Colombian's demands in the pot.
Rangers managed to draw only two shots on goal in the first half, but not a head shot sent by Lassana Coulibaly against the goal, nor a flimsy ball by Ovie Ejarri, posed no danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was completely deserved because of his perseverance.
The Rangers failed to cash in on another Jacobs long pass.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher got the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared a pass for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly during the break with winger Ryan Kent, who immediately proved himself with a pass to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more passes in front of the goal.
Holt's team could increase the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate after the pass from the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit him.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, that is, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
It has become a fixture in the scientific world, and has also gained its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are played by cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It’s used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactivity has on the atoms in the materials.”
“Oh my God, they’re really talking now!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to Identify Attacking Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to Identify Attacking Cells and Destroy Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise attack cells.
This method involves obtaining the patient’s immune cells, which are then altered in the laboratory.
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the trial vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize invading cells, the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient’s immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients who were “taught” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West performed a pro-Trump point after performing at SNL with the inscription MAGA on the cap.
The audience was not excited.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a freak show during which he voiced support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and also said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After the end of his third song, "Ghost Town", during which he wore a "Make America Great Again" cap, West launched an attack on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
The show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether this was intended to make fun of West.
West complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in the background due to the inscription on the cap.
“They came for me behind the stage.
They told me, ‘Don’t go on stage wearing that hat.’
They harassed me!
And they say I'm lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to put on “Superman’s cape because it means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments got the audience to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were clearly embarrassed, and someone told Vanity: “There was a deathly silence in the studio.”
West was invited to a last-minute goat swap for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused much astonishment with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a Perrier bottle of mineral water.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR UPDATEING HEAVEN.”
Karen Hunter, the talk show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “what he is, and that’s just fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and propagates an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
So do we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be “a creature formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first musician to change his name to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His classmate Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing man in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has spoken out against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's thrilling medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who strongly condemned the stereotype of the macho hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can earn respect only with perseverance.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture magazine that he thought something went wrong, and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo movement.
The actor, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, has admitted to having strong beliefs about the subject.
“Personally, I’m seriously wondering where we went wrong when it came to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men as we grew up about the problems we face now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the depiction of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do they teach us on TV and in the streets to make young boys feel that they have to choose this particular aspect of masculinity?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change that?
Something seems to be wrong with young people.”
In an interview, he also said that after the series ends next summer, he will not be involved in filming any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones because he has “completed the battlefields and horses.”
In November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on the set.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love-selected character of Kit Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases reported from China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was transmitted through sexual intercourse, which represents a change from the past.
Usually, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in such a way has decreased to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China continues to increase by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
With conservative values still in place in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman, according to research results.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking information about Republican senators, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations came from individuals and right-wing websites.
“Lies, lies, and more unforgivable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
This information was released online on Thursday by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment of Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after three senators finished questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP address could identify the source of the post, which is believed to be linked to Senator Waters’ office, and conclude that the information was posted by one of the staff.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk as a result of these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and outright false.”
Senator Waters' statement quickly came under fire online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Out of this denial there is a branch of anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“It may not be the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t show anger.
He can't resist.
And he can't question the motive of the man who accused him.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's Democratic criticism, who was accused of being too blatantly angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, responded via Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Ms Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had informed “the relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities regarding these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English is back in action as Rowan Atkinson
Searching for hints of Brexit in any new British film has become traditional, and it also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 under the title Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title Johnny English 2.
Is there going to be a fun satire about how bad we are, a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English gets permission to re-mix the cartoons with out-of-the-ordinary faces; his name suggests that he is a comic character created for a cinema audience in non-English-speaking areas.
He is a clumsy secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, includes part of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of the one who contributed the last note to the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It’s also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving a real mess behind.
The most recent film presents one or two pleasant moments.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, he was wearing medieval armor, and the rotor blades were briefly clipped against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and overly unnecessary, especially since "serious" films such as 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems that humor is meant for children and not for adults, which is why Johnny English's rejected experiences are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent skits in the role of Mr Bean.
It is now obvious that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the network of Britain's most secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble for the competent agent, played in a surprisingly small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is a turning point for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a breakdown due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has made an effort to play the supposed role of Theresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script to help her.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are being exposed, so she must opt for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school, unofficially teaching how to work undercover: this is where the writers hit, because English conducts a kind of spy “academy of rock”.
The Englishman is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets his longtime co-worker Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are ready to create more trouble on behalf of Her Majesty's Secret Service, while meeting the fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: Dressed up as a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos as they sneak aboard Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use virtual reality glasses to get to know the inside of Volt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the cuteness and vigor, it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Is a British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies that it is planning a four-day work week for the British, and would receive a paycheck for a five-day work week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The party wants the savings created by the artificial intelligence revolution to be passed on to workers and given them an extra day off.
That way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits with the party's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of workers.
Trade unions are supporting the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-week workweek is the goal that we will strive to achieve with the client’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the client’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week workweek in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this objective is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour representative said: “A four-week work week is not a party policy and the party does not think about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take away the power of “reckless CEOs” and “winners” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour party could introduce "deductions" on the basis of alleged injustices.
It also confirmed plans to include workers on boards and introduce equity integration funds, transferring 10% of the shareholding in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether their opinion could be changed by the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation.
The investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of the office of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withhold his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham were asked if the FBI would be able to find out anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open about it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing began, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him, when this accusation appeared, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’”
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice appears to be carved into the stone.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very convincing reason to change him,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, mentioning Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those who were called by her could confirm it.
The matter is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring a truly extraordinary array of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: to end world poverty.
Tens of thousands of people will attend the festival for the seventh time. They will occupy the Great Lawn of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to spark interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizens Festival is an expansion of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to an event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to persuade them to ask for action, or is this just another example of so-called “clictivism” - creating the belief that people actually make a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
According to the Global Citizen movement, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters have been recorded since 2011 in pursuit of a range of different goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group said its actions were the result of 390 commitments and messages that had already paid or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential” who pledged $35 million in aid to Rwanda to help end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition in historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Partnership, told the crowd at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions the UK had called for improved nutrition for mothers and children, the government had announced it would co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the site, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Performers who will be performing at this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Moné. The event will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said the U.S. could use the navy “as needed” to prevent Russian energy sales, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can tackle this. The Navy makes sure that our maritime routes are open and if necessary, it blocks them, thus preventing Russian energy from flowing into the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is referred to as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less to influence and replace fuels,” he said, calling Russia a “pony that knows one trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration is seeking to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is expected to push back Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to give up the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin a “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is violently opposed to the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Interference by a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to 'exactly study' her 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "exactly consider" her candidacy for the U.S. presidency after the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will study my candidacy for president in detail.”
At a meeting in the city hall, Warren scolded President Donald Trump for “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me deeply,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly criticized Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
A poll released on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe Warren should not be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick has more support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents saying she is supported and 48 percent opposed.
Other senior Democrats eligible for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin spoke at a rally in support of Donald Trump about the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after coming back, is connecting me with other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the hurt that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told an audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son's arrest as "an elephant in a saloon" and said her son and other war veterans were returning "somewhat changed, hardened, wondering where there is respect for what the fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the military have given to the country."
Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstructing reporting domestic violence, and possession of a weapon intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the rejection of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying victims of gang violence or domestic violence the right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the district filled the court lobby on Friday to support the legal challenge to the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been released.
She said she had been abused by her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang,” but on July 20, U.S. authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors in the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications have come to the United States, as countries that are constantly dealing with gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "despises decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Prosecutors said the policy, which denies immigrants the right to enter, was damaging the U.S. economy because they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue efforts are underway to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“It feels very tense,” 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her feverish boyfriend at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Rescuers are constantly bringing in the bodies.
There is no clean water.”
They looked like townspeople returning to ruined homes, breaking through wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, rested outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated in the open air for persistent heavy aftershocks.
Recalling the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to save us.
I think I was pressed against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'harassment' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after the publication of a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China, Beijing, accused the US press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned a paid supplement to the China Daily last Sunday in the Des Moines Register, the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6th U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
U.S. federal officials have described Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington’s intensifying efforts to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now duplicates this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government has used America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see few other opinions on the Beijing newsstands and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions Chinese citizens have on China’s worrying economic path, as the media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers turned down an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh floundering, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans, who support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
The sentiment here is extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell’s University of Syracuse for an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to investigate the FBI will be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget tomorrow and they won’t forget November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will exceed all bounds,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told reporters.
“People say you’re strong already, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially between undecided voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t like the president but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the council or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, the director of the U.S.-based Priorities group that supports Democrats in the election, told the television channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided between whether to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or most believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent said they definitely or most believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or certain to have lied while testifying, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Council under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals when they were at a party together during their 1980s Yale studies.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is opening a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners' open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was "to dominate the world".
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“This is an historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create a "personal data storage" or POD
This can include contact information, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
A distinctive feature of the personal data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal data empowerment.”
CEO John Bruce says the company’s idea is to bring together the resources, processes, and relevant skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and the group "do not discuss with Facebook and Google whether we could bring about a complete change that could shut down all of their business models overnight."
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee said in a statement on his website: “Inrupt’s purpose is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new internet built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“In terms of the next era of the web, I’m extremely optimistic,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross bearer from the First World War
For more than 100 years, the city has celebrated the award of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the Church of England, who won it as a fighter in the First World War.
Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned his accolade on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two of the colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act, which earned him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through St Quintin's Canal on 29 September 1918 "through a very dense fog and under the intense fire of the battlefield and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with "the greatest heroism", led the line forward, then attacked the machine gun and hit three members of the squad.
Lt. Col. Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 2018, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade," and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be expressed by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they were given Pepe Pigs.
Imagine: You’ve been up all night watching a fully-sold Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The event in San Jose spanned 13 matches, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to take on each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned to find that the transmission had been replaced by a Pig Pep cartoon.
Many of them weren’t too excited, as they stayed up until the morning just for the duel.
One fan described the switch to a children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
“Under the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the download.
"Pepa, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they are trying to adjust the schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“When I think about replays, I think we could sort that out,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won’t be able to arrange that until Sunday after our time, or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there were many messages exchanged when switching, and not all of them were kind.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed that it was only a technical error.
However, the actual reason was a government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five matches - as usual. We tried to offer our fans more than expectations and we counted on it.
It’s a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “undervalued” about sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said his sexual orientation made him feel inferior to everyone - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he was aware of the fact that “not everyone is like him” when he entered high school.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was diminished.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter for many years, was absent due to a months-long illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne’s first show, said he felt “less valuable” than everyone else because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said: “To date, these feelings of inferiority and difference are an actual thing that gives me the strength and persistence to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would finally learn of his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion has become an influential advocate for LGBT rights and has appeared twice this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said his romance with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised him."
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he says the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re that young,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley says it changed his “whole outlook.”
“If you asked me last year, all I would have to say is ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him, “You won’t be in the front row this time, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally had to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a home crowd. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of songs - "Proud" by Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15am (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson holds Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back in shape again so that this does not become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was left by Captain Furyk in the Saturday fours.
Instead of being at the center of events as he was so often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly in improving his game in order to correct what was weighing on him.
Given that even at the height of his career he did not measure the straightest, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow course Le Golf National, where a long back inevitably punishes missed shots.
And if the pitch alone wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will be dealing with the exact winner of Sunday’s British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in a jump to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have at the beginning of 12 games of individuals four games less, start well, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but otherwise he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he patted me on the back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the celebrities and has contributed tremendously to the teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out that way, and we felt that it had to be done.
He wants to play like everybody else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun playing with him this week, which was a lot of fun to see.”
“It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage may soon come to the fore
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the Ryder Cup games can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where the side, captained by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, and she made it through the goal with only a hair-less advantage, with a score of 141-2-131-2.
“Don’t forget that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” Bjorn (pictured) said after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and took the lead at the Le Golf National field with a 10-6 lead.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the cup is not over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
The game is not over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we need to stay focused on that.
“He’s always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the other side, the best players in the world.”
Impressed with his players’ performance on the challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never have gone too far here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow, there will be a game of individuals, so this will have to be tackled differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you’re there on your own, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: You have to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turnaround on the last day, as in Brookline he was part of the winning team before finishing as a loser when Europe performed the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had led his players into the final day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as quickly as we saw in Brookline.
When this momentum gains momentum, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
We created the right layout and put the guys in a way that made us feel like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter would be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“With this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
New German warship delayed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should be handed over in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it won’t be due to system failure and rapidly rising costs until at least next year, local media reported.
The handover of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military official.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by troubling questions after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigate class.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals - the newest frigates could stay out of their home port for up to two years.
The continued delays mean that the top warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to exert its influence overseas, will be obsolete by the time they are deployed, notes the newspaper Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and the German media cited a number of key “programming and technical flaws” that would make the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels would be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
The ship was also found to be severely overweight, reducing its capacity and limiting the Navy's options for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz was said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has become a problem.
It is expected to reach a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from an initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy was “lacking ships suitable for deployment.”
The official said that the issue had become more acute over time because the old ships had been decommissioned and no replacement vessels had been provided.
He regretted that no ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret lives of bats
A new study is under way on a property in the Highlands of Scotland to find out how bats use their diets to hunt for food.
They hope the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Endowment for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and tiny bats, as well as brown eared bats and bypass bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders will be set up at key locations of the estate to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls from bats and what types of what they do.
They will then draw up a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each individual species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flytraps and some types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats, pose a risk.
Bats are not actually blind.
Night hunting habits, on the other hand, help you more with your ears than your eyes.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately determine flight path errors and obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, shelter checks and occasional rescues.
The organization even established the first and so far the only Scottish reserve specifically for bats at the Threevee estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is their ideal territory.
“We have a great area for bats in Threave,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and a whole quality habitat.
However, there is still a lot known about bats, so the work we do here and on other estates will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, as the possible inadvertent destruction of a single bat maternity hospital could result in the death of up to 400 females and pups, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity hospitals.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how well their populations hold up.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel said on Friday that he would pay her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident.
Speaking to 142 million Instagram followers, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added smilingly.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for what they call “unacceptable reporting of suspicions of private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “non-pecuniary damage of an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personality rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the case file filed with the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, she allegedly returned to the player’s room after a meeting at the nightclub of Mayorga with Ronaldo, and he allegedly raped her there.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told her he was a “99 per cent good man” who disappointed only “one per cent”.
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, and later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terribly afraid of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims she wants to overturn the settlement as she continues to suffer severe trauma due to the alleged event.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before moving from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus under a deal worth $100 million.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' loss of carmakers
The UK would “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been voiced by other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “time-to-time” basis, with parts of UK and EU automotive suppliers arriving on demand every 37 minutes.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March, this could lead to disruptions at borders that industry representatives say could lead to congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store parts for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, company officials said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks”.
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told Today’s BBC Radio 4 show.
“The data from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be halted, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union in the factory, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job is never recovered.”
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could see the ongoing fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “rescheduled for another week,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian election meddling, ties between Trump’s associates and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general’s envoy and jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been fueling Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretapping device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that he was planning to step down.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said he would “rather not” fire Rosenstein, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could happen this week, and given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, he could be put off for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to keep you informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with the press since September 10th.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings should not be attributed to a reluctance to “post” TV reporters, but she said: “I couldn’t deny that they are being set up.”
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, without specifying the source, adding: “We looked at the numbers.”
“But if the press can address the president of the United States directly with their question, it’s infinitely better than discussing it with me.
We are trying to make this as possible and you have seen that we have done this a lot in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference where you can speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared openly and in part bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to NHS Scotland on Brexit-related concerns
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire to continue the work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued, as decisions are approaching this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
You can feel completely at home in Scotland. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After Head Injury
A linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He got to the edge of the field and kind of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the edge of the field before placing him on a stretcher and taking him off the field for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the details of the type/scope of the injury are not yet known" and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman, is playing for Tennessee State University for the first time since graduating from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five batters before exiting the game, raising his total number of batters in the season to 18 batters.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the UK, and additional money will be used under new Tory plans to help the homeless
The move will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the amount will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing and higher taxation for high-income earners.
The raised levies will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra money will boost the government's efforts to end homelessness.
The mark-up - which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including raised levels introduced two years ago for other homes and rental properties - could amount to no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
Non-UK nationals are estimated to buy 13 per cent of newly built London properties, resulting in price increases and a harder time buying the first property.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital city - have become "ghost towns" as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of weight to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Large construction companies have accused the price hikes of grabbing land they don't actually use, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to repair Britain's "residential shame."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including controlling rents and ending forced evictions without errors.
It also wants to give city councils more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premier leadership to the renewal of the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
It also means repairing our dysfunctional housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
It cannot be right, however, that for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies, buying homes is as easy as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to manage the Scotland club'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become manager of the Scotland club one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving North-East, which currently occupies third place in the Premier League, three points short of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship in his final season.
“I wanted to play as an actor.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told the BBC’s Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only be given this opportunity if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team boss Alloa Athletic, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he felt no fear as a successor to such big names.
“Success for me is measured by the question, ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’”
In terms of structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs in the First League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy road, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could take the club there again.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and part of the Hearts' coaching staff for 15 months.
Alloi then helped prevent a third-tier loss, and led St Mirren from the brink of a loss to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This was probably a real turning point,” he recalled taking over Alloe.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny, because as an actor I was doing well, I was having a relatively good time and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
We have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing to do.
I’ve always wanted to run a club and I’m doing it now. I feel most comfortable in my own skin throughout my adult life.”

The perfect time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat increased the income of hard-to-break British pubs, but there was also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business adviser, who compiled the data, said: “England’s persistent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to June last month, when pub revenue increased by 2.8 percent, only to see restaurants hit even harder.
The drop in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June increased even further.
The traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased more compared to each other, as the traffic in restaurants decreased.
The sunny weather has also reduced sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, but not as dramatically as with restaurant managers.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month and the sales of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman of the RSM leisure and hospitality analyst group said: “These results continue a trend we’ve seen since late April.
When selling in the hospitality market, the weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop will be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressures.
For owners of food outlets, a long hot summer could not come at a more inconvenient time, and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in brand adoption.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a measure of sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is an established industry reference.
One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has a secret account on social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has raised fears about sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “master account” that is aimed at parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create an account on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about sex-related content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censored “main” account that they show their parents, but also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter was urging visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Principals and Principals (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers succumb to temptation and create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Voice of Athletes' at Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director of the annual general assembly of the board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete on the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for those who direct the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience internationally over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community. We are confident that by joining the committee, athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope to be able to really contribute and help run the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing exercises for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An advertisement for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows has split online reviews
The company that produces breast pumps has divided opinions with an ad that compares mothers with cows when milking.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer tech company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show mothers all the freedom the gadget provides.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a hay-filled barn to a song that includes the following lyrics: “Yes, I’m pumped, but there’s no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my sessions, these are my boobs.”
The chorus continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts.”
But an ad posted on Facebook’s website has caused considerable resentment online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was joking at the expense of the "ugliness" of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen in the first days after birth.”

The second commented: “Of course, it is traumatic for both mother and calf.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “Advertisement completely without feeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she found the song "funny to die for".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it, just as it was meant to.
It’s a great product,” wrote another.
Someone commented, “It’s a ridiculous ad targeting moms who milk themselves (often at work or the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have danced with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of the action is that many women who pump their breasts say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a nursing bra, allowing women to move, hold a baby, and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Anna Ballarin, Mothers’ Partner and ECD, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
By drawing a parallel between milk-absorbing women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk-absorbing and all its challenges, while at the same time showing in a fun way that women can connect, an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two walked behind designer Marta Jakubowski on the model track when she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly resettled in tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to hand over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they fear that asking for a child would jeopardize their chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
With the aim of treating children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Many will show up with a video conference call rather than in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for the aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to shelter workers and reports created in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
Proponents said these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's distress are more likely to go unnoticed due to their size.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without emotionally preparing them or giving them a chance to say goodbye to friends can complicate the trauma many of them are dealing with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even if the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also carries out the duties of the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and will “act accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have had to leave their homes, was "almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this war-torn country.
On refugees, Moualem said the conditions for them to return were appropriate, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" that had convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to facilitating their return,” he said.
“They are turning it into a political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funding until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention will target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who will be “eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, soon to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will get a second term
After that conclusion, Mr Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
This is without a doubt the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
So far, there is no sign of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News received an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show reached the highest number of cable viewers with 3.5 million viewers on the nightly breaking news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, head of the drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an acclaimed comedy writer and author of “Just Funny Pieces: And Some Hard Truths About Snooping at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide the future of the Roe v. Wad case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, six-hour viewing of a round table of experts discussing the use of a “deep background” source for Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” a $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“clothing thickly lined with pomp,” The Washington Post said) and the aftermath of Trump’s shocking descriptions, khm, anato.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing that makes a reality show look like he’s offering something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the cast of the Trump Show and the daytime spin-offs of the script (N.F.L. duel, Kim Jong Un’s praise).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you’ll be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn’t get away with it, even when Brett Kavanaugh was facing a Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the air.
“I remember we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money is flowing in preparation for the closest mid-term parliamentary elections
Unsurprisingly, the 17th Pennsylvania district is seeing a flood of money, as two candidates found themselves in a race for the same seat due to the re-arrangement of the congressional districts.
This recently re-divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in another district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn when a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district touched on the campaign finance struggle between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. was considering sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to end recognition of Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have been considered on El Salvador, which is expected to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a limit on financial assistance and a targeted restriction on visa issuance, would hurt this Central American country with high unemployment and a number of murders.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was deemed a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, ending thoughts about penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing attendees at a conference now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the significance the U.S. government attributes to the meeting, diplomats added.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further hard news or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now a great deal of evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also said to be leading the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in attacking the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to the authorities and perhaps even to a jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are many questions here, and I do not want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to launch an attack on Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, thereby missing the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At these turning points, the course of history is changing and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are dealing with a lot of these issues right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly filming the president and speculating about his unfitness for the position.
Mr Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s requested FBI investigation is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will claim Mr. Trump’s responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
How could I not be so optimistic about our future?”

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of face-off with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with it clear that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time during the season before a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a starting point for major achievements.
“It was a well-deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game in the belief that we can achieve something and score a point.
Perhaps you could win in the end, but in general draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am sure that with the crowd behind us we can make an effort and achieve a positive result.
The last year has been undoubtedly difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Poor sleep due to fear of savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they should be cared for, few people discussed this with their family members.
Half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t bother to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t talk to them in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Involve a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the transition.
Choose a health care representative by appointing a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that your health wishes are respected by professionals if you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider entrusting a person with your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in your action plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.”
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
A man returning home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The gunman, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was repeatedly shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at approximately 2:30 a.m. British time, as an “accidental act”.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called possible witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With communication links broken, rescuers from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are aquaculture and agriculture, especially in the central region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it mostly takes place in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo have been repeatedly hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit northern Donggalo, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that floods its southern coast and causes the deaths of nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and causing the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not set off, but the fallen buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone out of her hands.
Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Institution and is in custody under an uninsured guarantee of $500, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he pleaded “certainly not guilty” when asked about his defence, the network reported.
Palin was charged with three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Indonesia Tsunami Earthquake: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were detained in the town of Palu at a beach festival.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, when he ran over several pedestrians and a cyclist in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a death penalty request notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty can be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a grand jury briefed Saipova on a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of extortion murder, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s manner as “detestable, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District pronounced the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but his sentence was finally commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months that followed the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS that he had watched on his phone.
Police also said they had requested the display of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "apparently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defence group had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage has vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a Tory conference.
The former head of the Ukip said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a campaign rally in Birmingham that the UK “would be out now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided species has been highlighted by Tories who are in favour of quitting Brexit, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her plan on track between attacks by Brexiteers, opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted May would try to reach a deal in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he "wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
This MP from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU in these words: "In the world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The thought that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
At the meeting, the Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns said: “I simply say: ‘Ministerial President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our party and our activists who are active on the streets and lead us to an election in the first place.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.’”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians should be given “the heat” if they plan to issue a decision in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue a Brexit, and today we’re here to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of issuing Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country, which has assured us of victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved the Tories’ anti-Brexit flags this weekend after the group was formed.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues when using the party's app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus agreement, for the border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says she will "explore" possible presidential bids
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "explore" participation in the race for the presidency after November's election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chair of Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the center of speculation that it could deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top.”
Arrest after LSU player Sims' death in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge police station reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the 247sports network.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he had shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was approaching the title of world champion, and the team told him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettl
On Saturday, as Valtteri Boltas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that “the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race”.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettl to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to box and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes drove into the box later and left him behind Vettel, but after some driving action Hamilton noticed that the Ferrari driver's reluctance left the inside open and risked falling behind after two moves for the defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then drove for most of the match without changing tires, as he intended to make a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally went into boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase his speed, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me by.
The team has done a really great job to get first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch on Ford’s testimony before the Senate Investigative Committee, but instead said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “wicked, corrupt, and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt, and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the revelations, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you expose this?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” he added about the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September - but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose her letter,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
Her denial, however, apparently did not suit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In defense of a Supreme Court candidate who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president hinted that Democrats were abusing the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
You’ve seen the meanness, the obscenity, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to run over to get to power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's game in Dundee 5-3.
The Giants scored two goals early on with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for home, and then Dwyer again scored an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for the Dundees before Lundvald Nielsen's two goals ensured them victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat the Dundees 2-1 on Friday night from behind.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal of the game in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, and Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later, was passed by David Rutherford.
In an intense opening act, Sullivan led the home side into the game at 1:10 p.m., and Matt Marquardt gave Cowney the tie at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' lead in the break when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home side rallied again, and Bouchard made up the gap with a forceful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to lead the Dundees into the lead at the end of the second third and secured the win with their team's fifth goal of the half and secured the win with their team's fifth goal in the half of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home to Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Kills Hundreds of People on Plane to Escape Earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after sacrificing his life to allow a plane with hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed in Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by a tsunami, and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by powerful aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in place so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We have prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks my heart to hear this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's disaster relief agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of dead is expected to increase further, as many bodies were buried under the rubble and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six metres high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings in bodies every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said: “I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it was initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to a call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in stable condition at the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed a runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
“That’s great,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, managed to make his way through the belt-widening water to emergency exits on the dive plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, but he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were repairing the pier nearby also came to the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in aviation accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
Analyst determined the time of night when a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors on Saturday presented their evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the whereabouts of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers’s at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "lying because [my] truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone during the time after Chambers' death.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its closing arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial would be judged by a jury later that day.

Another black woman?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her for 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing the couple for discriminatoryly firing her after receiving a misspelled message from a mother who complained she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies any racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she found out she was black when the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
“NEEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK,” Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding her slip-up, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable,” fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire a Filipina, the New York Post reported.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work, and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now seeking damages of $350 per day from the couple in court for a period of six months to perform the work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, you don’t do that sort of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after the outrage.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on.”
Comparing the lawsuit to “emigration,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to treat someone that way?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court quickly condemned the couple on social media for their behavior and way of thinking.
Publishers of Paddington bear stories feared readers would not connect with the talking bear, a new letter has revealed
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to find out now that Paddington has become a huge hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before gaining inspiration to write a children's book about a little teddy bear toy, would be outraged at the rejection of her work, adding that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book was "bitter-sweet".
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You’re proud of him, even if you’re not really doing it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed the success to Paddington the Bear himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was transported to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to preserve her life.
“She called regularly to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad, and he told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly decelerated and left her system.
She had been dying for some time, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down and tears were running down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this intense sense of compassion for Hope on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning Female Lepita Posters to Prevent Suicides on the Bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys fly posters on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he became depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, at the age of 11, was the one who found a sibling when he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I am constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters “to let other people know there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened the presents, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they have to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She ripped us apart.
But we must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance as FBI probe begins
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for, after the duration and scope of the limited investigation, it might unify us,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world was “collapsed” due to the party’s entrenched stalemate.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections on November 6 - if, as is expected, Republicans do poorly, this will greatly weaken them in trying to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and who he introduced to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can muster at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the Vice President, a breakthrough from the stalemate and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has fallen under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said 1,127 people overran last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the price demanded by people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not yet commented publicly on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross as a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers migrants illegal, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South - which are still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they broadly agreed on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the US sanctions to a stalemate since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘hysterical’ and says he’s not fit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "characterically unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything else but to call a woman ‘hysterical’ if she behaves like that,” Kavanaugh said Thursday before a Senate inquiry committee.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and suffocating in the debate about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission, calling the accusations against him a “grotesque and coordinated smear” organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he should not be appointed as Supreme Court justice, as it showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with these kinds of statements and the way he dealt with Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi asked whether she would try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s unfit not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was "democratically concerned" about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wad case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t this wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And a woman's got to wield it.
It is a righteous outburst, after months and years of shedding anger, and cannot express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, do you?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was a director somewhere, who also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique, namely, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
Then she simply continued.
I thought it was top of the line.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger partly because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories from my early career, when I was still working in an office dominated by men, and I once found myself weeping in unspeakable rage, was an event when an elderly woman grabbed me by the throat - a cold leader who was always a little afraid to drag me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand that you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad you got beat up.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over the counter in a boat called Monkey Business and had to leave the race, Mrs. Schroeder found deeply distressed that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me in a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the match and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
He called the game “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since she was the last to join the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the match unless she collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a conversation that she would not launch an official campaign, she was overcome by feelings of gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism that she began to suffocate.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media’s reaction.
“They would think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
‘Was she crying?’”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is long overdue, experts say the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, triggered the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated with equivalent retaliation, most recently with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to keep an eye on the U.S. and is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
In order for Washington to back down, China would have to agree to his demands, but the U.S. public abstinence would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say that if Beijing is able to make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic turmoil in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He said he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled through most of the championship, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole in a par-3 game on his opening kick, forcing him to hand the game over to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined through all rounds and has become one of four players to have achieved a score of 5-0-0 at any time since the start of the championship in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, with 25.5 points became the most victorious European player in the championship of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
This year has been hard.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy we won the trophy again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy to be able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The baton is handed over to compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the championship.
The US captain said after a bad performance for his team, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to have to get back together, I'm going to work with the American PGA Alliance and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I really love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
Hats off.
They overcharged us.”
News of the Red Tide: Concentrations along the coasts of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratosa counties are decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Protection Commission (FWC) shows an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC has reported more diffuse blooms in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles from the coast north of Pinellas County to the southern Lee counties.
The plazas look about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
A red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, medium concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County and along its coast, low to high concentrations along the coast of Hillsborough County, basic to high concentrations in Manatee County, basic to high concentrations in Saratosa County and along its coast, basic to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, and basic to high concentrations in Lee County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported from Northwest Florida in the past week.
