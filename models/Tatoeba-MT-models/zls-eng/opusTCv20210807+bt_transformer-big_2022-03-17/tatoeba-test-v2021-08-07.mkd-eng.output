I recognize the tipon.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd get it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I've seen him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister tear out the letter.
But I didn't see anything at all.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes calorific?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I should go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Did you study outside?
Is it ready?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I slapped him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the chun.
I slept on the bus.
I slashed the sandwich.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this overwhelming?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day shoveling snow.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started to think about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that what Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Does that word even exist?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
And that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love the horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back yet?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I say we go home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm starving you to bend over.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I suspected.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch you on fire if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still running?
Is your head full of straw?
I took the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't have been a coincidence.
So, no, no.
It can't be!
It concerns you.
It was doing a lot more than I expected.
It could never, ever, ever happen here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
Doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I've had enough.
That gave me an idea.
I've got work to do.
It had to be done.
It has to come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It happens.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I think about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat out.
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I've made a good point.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should check out Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak very good French.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's being cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's being petty.
I think Tom's a schmuck.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's tempered.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink the water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you made it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think you've been lied to.
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
I think it's helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I've been thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd get him some help.
I thought I'd get them some help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought I was imagining it.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom was having a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we might be able to help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you'll have your hands full.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
Did you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It hurts terribly here.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup lifted.
It's a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether you buy it or not.
It's his first day of school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll get the job done in a day.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
It's on me.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting one famous paragraph of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written all over his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
Happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
Soon it will be Christmas.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
It looks familiar.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
These two seem to be in a relationship again.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You've healed me.
It bothers me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be difficult.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but an order was.
It might rain tonight.
It might seem strange.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you so.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this would get messy.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I took a bath.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I completely understand.
It probably won't be worth the wait.
It was raining two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulty.
I tried to explain it to him, but I didn't button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust my teacher.
I try not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check to see if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything is in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over in a minute.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost got to go.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It is about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
It's a quick walk.
It's simple.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They disassembled it.
It's just a pain in the ass.
It's been raining for a week or so.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be an optimist and a fool than to be a pessimist and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna is here.
It's a new coin.
You scared me.
There's nobody here.
It's time to close.
Studios here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
That seems to be the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's how you need it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's evil to curse.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's right.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She got dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It'll get even colder.
It'll happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
That's good.
It got better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in great condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is yes.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little further.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
None of your business!
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a high priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not just a pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not that we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's busted.
It's pretty common, actually.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It really sucks.
It's too bad.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's cool!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark out there.
It is still for sale.
It's still working.
It's not working yet.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was flat as a mirror.
It's that time again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's really cool.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
You can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
No way I'm guessing.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a talk.
It was so beautiful.
That was embarrassing.
It was after midnight.
It's been an arduous day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
It was all so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure spending the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was getting late.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's good of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn’t easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been shown that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
You blew a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was hung on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a try.
It was your mistake.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
That's not gonna help you.
It works well.
It would be very normal to get angry at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to watch over you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything that needed to be written.
I've already written my piece of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone has always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get hold of something like this.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've been a lot worse.
I've been betrayed.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was careless.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I was helping them.
They hired me to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I have lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been busy enough.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I have been learning French since the age of 13.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've been watching.
I came for them.
I came to bring him a present.
I cut my finger.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences this whole month.
I decided to forgive him.
I decided to forgive them.
I decided to take the train.
I decided to go.
I decided to let you go back to work.
I decided to stay where I am.
I've got everything in love with you.
I finally found you.
I did my job.
I fixed his radio.
I already forgave you.
I went to Boston twice.
I'm used to talking in public.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
I have it with me.
I've got it all figured out.
It's right here.
I have a bunch of questions.
I have tons of questions.
