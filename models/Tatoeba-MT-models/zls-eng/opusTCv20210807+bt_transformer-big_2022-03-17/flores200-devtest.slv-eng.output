While one trial vaccine is thought to reduce Ebola mortality, no drug has been clearly shown to be suitable for treating an existing infection.
One of the cocktails of antibodies, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in this area, but formal studies have shown that it brings less benefit in terms of preventing death than we would like.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control drug, which means that it was used as a base, and the other three drugs were compared with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that the interests of our athletes, clubs and their sports will be better represented if we move forward with significant changes within the organization and not by withdrawing confirmation.

This confirms the well-established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, while also providing data that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional distribution.
. Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper side, and pastel or carotenoid colored on the lower side.
The find also provides an insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's pens do not have a well-developed shell, which is called a rib, but all other properties of the pen - twigs and hooks - the researchers found that the rib very likely developed later in evolution than other properties.
From the structure of the feathers, we can conclude that they were not used to escape, but to regulate temperature or show off. Although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, according to the researchers, the pattern suggests that it is the feathers of an adult specimen, and not the fluff of a puppy.

A car bomb that exploded yesterday at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.
The governor's office said 19 police officers were injured.
Police said they suspected an Islamic State (IS) member of the group.
They found that the Sun works in the same way as other stars: all the stars in the system are driven by their radiance and rotation and nothing else.
The radiance and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic pole replacements.

The 802.11n standard operates at both the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
For this reason, it will be backward compatible with the 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g standards, if the base station will have a dual radio.
The speeds of the 802.11n standard are significantly higher than those of its predecessors with a maximum theoretical transmittance of 600 Mbit/s.

The Iraq Research Group presented its report today at 12.00 GMT.
It warns that no one can guarantee that actions in Iraq will stop sectarian warfare, rising violence or plunge into chaos.
The report opens with a call for an open debate and agreement in the United States on a policy towards the Middle East.
In almost all respects, the report is very critical of the current policy of the executive towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observation of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would have been caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also forcibly affects the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to conclude that a dark substance on another dark substance acts similarly to a normal substance.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is contained around it in the form of a ring composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new version "is of considerable concern and discomfort due to the exceptional mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the bacterium in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were health workers in the hospital.
Within a year, an infected person can infect from 10 to 15 close contacts.
The proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis already seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any one time in South Africa.

The government has also pledged millions of vials of the encephalitis vaccine to help health agencies prepare for next year.
This year's planned delivery of vaccines to historically worst-affected areas has been postponed due to a lack of funding and low priority compared to other diseases.

They don’t have as stable thermal properties as the large pits on Earth, which often maintain a more or less constant temperature, but are appropriate given that they are deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeological team at the USGS and the University of Northern Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with a marked choice into the envelope.
Once the official has confirmed the identity of the voter, he shall put this envelope in the ballot box and sign it on the electoral register.
The French electoral legislation sets out this procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them at the start of the elections and that no envelope has been added other than those submitted by duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes, taking into account certain procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and got her mobile phone and laptop back.”
The accused were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants came to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Later, the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, Adekoyo, accused her son of murder.
She is awaiting indictment and trial in custody, but eyewitness accounts can be unreliable, as her picture has been published everywhere.
This is a consistent practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates in a different way and the court has ruled that the publication of the photos is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: “Journalists have found themselves on thin ice if they publish photos of the suspects and the like.”
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully in charge of prosecution, told reporters that it would not make any further comments until the indictment.
It was revealed that the document will refer to a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the borders before the war that took place in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is considered sacred in both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for another ten years after the agreement was signed, and the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to five years of such presence.
The shooters in the attempt to further control the pests were under the supervision of guards, since the test is controlled and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In cooperation with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS' Park Conservation and Heritage Executive, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive security and training guidance.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the nine-member Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections, the presidential commission proposed the preliminary resignation of the Interim Electoral Council.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which are sometimes violent, triggered failed elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "dangerous".
The ministry's response was that Apple's postponement of the report was "really regrettable".
Mariano was struck by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Crisis Management said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical journey.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Hospital for Women in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to explore premature birth in his spare time.
From his research, it is clear that in the case of the addition of the hormone in the child, fetal development of the lungs is accelerated.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of the plane on Wednesday.
My fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the moon.
"Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Moon died on the night of two moons. Just as amazing as she was herself. Strong woman," said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "The moon was just as weird as me...maybe even more...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a nicer place."
Among the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, president of the transitional government, argued that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents agree with Queen Elizabeth II’s demand to be Australia’s last ruler.
On the one hand, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and on the other hand, 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems, his fitness was questionable.
He was not allowed to take the drugs he needed to relieve pain, as these are prohibited at games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery, which was announced on Tuesday, was confirmed by several people by early February using a variety of hardware and software.
Comets could represent a source that brought water and organic matter to Earth from which proteins can be made and which makes life possible.
Scientists hope to find out how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, as it is a long time since comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month backed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based rather than old radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely determine the aircraft’s location and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley, parking lots and services park and ride on the surface are not available.
Due to the fear of lack of traffic connections, there is a chance that the game will be forced to play behind closed doors, without supporters of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has emerged in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden reported a new species that evolved by crossing between the endemic Darwinian finch, Geospizzo fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospizzo fortes, in just two generations, although they previously thought the process took much longer.
Gold can be formed into many different shapes. It is possible to roll it into small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire, which can be twisted and knitted. It can also be forged or rolled into strips.
It can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called pH chemicals. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The green juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both powders and form them into a ball with clean moist hands.
Wetness on the palms will react with external layers, which will cause a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the sewage system were found in houses in Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women met in mixed societies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, more than 100 feet in size.
The bicycle has completely changed the world. One of its most prominent contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It brought us a train, a car and many other forms of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are also a number of small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much more abundant prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special work that each cat has, protecting it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
In the herd are one to three males who are related, and up to thirty females and pups.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely related to each other.
A herd of lions behaves very much like a herd of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not the best), swim, skip great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
Tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four representatives of large cats are the only ones who can roar.
Tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as a lion's, but rather cut off roaring and screaming.
Ozelots feed on small animals. If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that Ozelot hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists think the ocelots are tracking and searching animals for food (prey) with the help of a scent, as they can smell where they were staying on the ground.
Because of night vision, they can see very well at night and also move silently. The ocelots prey by first merging with the surrounding area, and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain chain or river or moves to a new island and is difficult to return to), it will often find itself in a different environment than it lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population over time.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years from now, populations will seem so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe and take in carbon dioxide that people squeeze out of their lungs (or exhale).
Plants with photosynthesis grow food with the help of the sun. They also offer shade.
We make our own houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaur was the ultimate predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and he had extra teeth in the sky, killing everything that crossed his path.
We don't have the exact data, but he may have had a split tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish and other mososaurs, maybe even a cannibal.
He also attacked all the creatures that went into the water; not even huge dinosaurs, such as tyrannosaurs, could match him.
Although their food seemed familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, pava, snails, and a type of rodent called pollus.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat in chairs while eating, the rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on their side while eating.
Ancient meals could not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built each god’s main temple, which was supposed to be the home of each god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special towers in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The life of the Hebrew family took place mostly in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all “Scandinavian” countries, there were many differences between their people, kings, customs, and history.
If you’ve seen the movie Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think there’s a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large document on the parchment (measured 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was stored in the form of a scroll at the beginning of its life.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a markup.
With the D-Day landings and battles that followed, northern France was liberated, while the south was still unliberated.
It was ruled by the "higher" French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France, calling the invasion Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the French Free Forces liberated the south of France in just two weeks and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a large group of individuals who live and collaborate together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civic, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in a way also denotes the size of society.
Urban countries are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization includes the transmission of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural trace, and a significant prevalence.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces, so they cannot be considered a true civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states with provisions on confederation first formed a weak central government - composed only of Congress.
Congress did not have the power to enforce the duties, but because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities for the enforcement of its laws, which often refused to cooperate.
In addition, it had no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
In order to supplement the Articles, the consensus of all states was required, but individual states did not take the central authorities seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the world champion in football in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view, it is often referred to as an "archipelago"
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform indigenous ways of grain production and employ Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's west and north coasts, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Sun Tower, and the Three Windows Shrine.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to make it easier for tourists to imagine what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its image ratio has also been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The image ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the most basic ratio in the form of an integer) is thus 3:2.
Many common formats (ASP family of formats) are the same or very close to this height-width ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time provides a criterion for image arrangement.
After it, the most effective place for the main object should be at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, enriching and expanding its authority.
The Christian religion has united European countries for more than a millennium, despite differences in language and habits.
Its omnipresent power affected both kings and ordinary people.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the church is meant to do just that.
The seat of the church’s central authority has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it really follows this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy to cut off the most important military and civilian supplies proved effective, but this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire areas of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant views of most citizens and nations.
After seeing the horrors and horrors of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job at Edison, New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only four cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager of his previous job), addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China depicted different periods of time in a special way; each stage of China, or each family in power, was a recognisable dynasty.
During the individual dynasties, there was also an unstable period when the provinces were divided. Among these periods, the most famous is the period of the three kingdoms during the period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, fierce fighting took place among the many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died fighting for the highest chair in the great palace of the city of Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
In addition, professions were open to all male seekers after the revolution, which allowed them to succeed the most ambitious and successful.
This also applies to the military, as military ranks instead of class are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in things beyond this earthly life, visiting a cave known as “Hirah” on Mount Nur (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad’s spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely remote from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if we know it exists.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky above your head and the many surrounding mountains, you can’t see anything else from the inside of the cave.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of a number of major pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau or in the "necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (of which the largest is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The label for "bow up" looks like the letter V, and for "bow down" it looks like a staple or square without the bottom page.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it down means you should start at the frog (that is, where you hold the bow with your hand) and the bow pull.
The pull of the bow from above usually creates a softer sound, while the pull of the bow from below is stronger and more resolute.
If desired, you can draw your bow markings with a pencil, but do not forget that the printed bow markings are indicated for the sake of music, so they should otherwise be taken into account.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the royal sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to retreat to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a chariot surrounded by crowds, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
At some point, one of the crowd waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves when they conquered the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the breakaway gains stemming from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would represent the basic income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context for which order was created.
The era in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.)
Before the High Middle Ages it was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by agreement ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological need to the idea that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their implementation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have the same general idea: that the very development of technology follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently produces "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that with the development of the car will certainly develop roads.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for only a few cars, so new ways of making it are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for the care of damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and culture associated with a particular geographical area appeared, which were in harmony with the state of society and thus better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris today, the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being the center of luxury began around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
Its status declined somewhat in the twelfth century as the Crusaders returned home full of gifts in the form of silks and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of the fashion capital from Constantinople moved to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress had a strong touch of Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication links, styles in the West could be lagging behind for 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, they began to form their own style in Western Europe. One of the greatest advances of the time and the result of the Crusades was that they began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a term used for agriculture with the purpose of producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is a simple, often ecological system in which saved seeds originating from the same ecological region are used, combined with crop rotation or other simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers engaged in self-sufficiency agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social standards and enable them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may vary by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture recognizable can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subcultures often show their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of a style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and arga.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to derive from a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized during adulthood due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or wild children. Some wolf children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents); such a form of child abuse was in some cases the result of the rejection of the child's more severe mental or physical disability by parents.
Before they were abandoned or fled, wild children in childhood may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma.
Others are said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When wild children are fully raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost exactly the same as that of animal caretakers, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, it goes a step further.
Erection is not a learning method, but rather a help that provides support to individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of stage, but this also applies to a small clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are an internal part of the software and are supposed to ask questions, encourage and explain procedures that could be too challenging for the student himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and nurturing, and yet it is happening.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessary life goods that they did not have in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines both the elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of application and approach to reward.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are believed to be important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “permanent relationships” were also recognized as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), as they studied how the audience responds to websites.
Video recording has allowed important discoveries in the interpretation of micromovements, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
They say, in particular, that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, explained that people who are unable to understand speech because of a brain injury are nevertheless able to accurately assess honesty.
It even assumes that animals such as domestic dogs have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Research from the twentieth century shows that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of pronounced variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistribute variations here and there between two folds.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human, with plant resources available in the savanna, has difficulty meeting the amino acid requirements.
In addition, if this need cannot be met, there are serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be the proteins present in the leaves and legumes, which are difficult to digest for primates, including us, if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal food ( ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a source of high-quality protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Interruption is a procedure during which you deliberately wake up during normal sleep time and soon fall asleep again (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not wake you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up and go to the water.
The amount of inner peace of the individual is in contrast proportional to the amount of tension in the individual's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and satisfaction.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on the way to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Although Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, it also refers to the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple. It consists of yoga kundalini, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations allows you to awaken the energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment).
Central Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Since Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the USSR and the United States began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, but it was really fought, with the help of intermediary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was the retreat and redeployment at the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete practically overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union stepped in and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern Polish regions, which was contrary to the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using a ship to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of the Navy was to ensure that the state retained the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of such recent cases that is most noteworthy was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. To help Britain, the Americans tried to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy wanted to stop this kind of traffic, especially with U-boats.
Had the Allied powers failed, Germany would probably have been able to take over Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often cared for by goat herders who were rarely children or adolescents, much like the more well-known sheep herders. These ways of herd management are still used today.
In England, rails were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for the wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they were able to achieve higher speeds and tow greater loads than on the slightly worse roads of the time.
Quite soon they began to use thresholds to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, they found that the tracks are more effective if they have a strip of iron on top.
This became a universal practice, but due to iron, wooden wheels on wagons wore out faster.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails were introduced, which were made entirely of iron.
Walking was the first known means of transportation, people began to walk upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus (or upright man) appeared.
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Two-legged walking features are present on Australopithecine fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
Our lives can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the core of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed tremendously due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have also increased due to overpopulation and human wasteful lifestyles.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap Printing House.
At night, they produced between 150 and 200 copies, known as Dunlap flyers.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy reached London on August 10th.
There are still 25 Dunlap flyers that are considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, as the handwritten original has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day.
Many people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these two numbers are called binary digits - or bits if we use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious. Signs such as vomiting are general enough that it is impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main sign indicating internal poisoning is the possible presence of open packaging with drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if specific first aid instructions are given for this poison.
Entomologists officially use the term insects for this group of insects.
This term derives from the prehistoric kinship with mites, highly developed human parasites.
Both predatory bedbugs and dust mites are nesting animals that are adapted for life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, namely the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that taking care of a child is not in their best interest or for the benefit of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can take on the role of the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using a scientific method. This method actually leads most scientific research.
But that’s not all, an important part of scientific research is also testing, where the test is a test designed to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers devoted themselves to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
In all areas of science, including psychology, Aristotle's views were established.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation with the help of biological clocks.
Repeated rhythms, which are not just responses to periodic external stimuli, have been recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of continuous cyclic repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacteria using phages or viruses.
Two experiments were carried out, where DNA was labeled in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can be very different, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, and elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is seeing, photographing, and getting to know orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural places in cars to get to work, and those who work in the place from where they have just left are driving past them.
In this dynamic means of transport, everyone is somehow connected to the transport system based on passenger cars and also supports it.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution over the past two million years.
In society, everyone cooperates and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why are there so many complaints at the expense of transportation systems, why do they fail every day? Is it the incompetence of traffic engineers? Or maybe it is something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, since the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, as a rule, the behavior of drivers is established to some extent, so traffic flows are also established and can be roughly presented in mathematical form.
In order to better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the main three characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roadways.
Insects were the first animals to take off. Due to their ability to fly, they more skillfully avoided enemies and more effectively searched for food and mates.
Most insects have this advantage that they can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can not fold wings against the body are snake shepherds and unicorns.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, which stretches for up to six miles, is also the widest river on Earth.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical expertise of their construction were never exceeded.
During the New Kingdom period, Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican has legislation and official communication in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most workers in the country, while in religious rites they often use Latin.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and can be fairly easily excavated with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle formulated the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
In fact, there were more four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he claimed that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two metals or more. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that they could be put into trillions at the end of this sentence.
So the pen was a dear friend to many at the time of his invention.
Unfortunately, new methods of writing appeared, and the pencil was pushed to the side track.
People are now texting on computer screens and not even getting close to the spike.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer appears.
A fission bomb works by combining a nucleus with many protons and neutrons and requires energy.
It's like pushing a heavy cart down a hill, and some of that energy is then released by re-collapse of the core.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they usually decay on their own or almost without help.
The surface of the Moon is composed of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
On the near side, the crust is about 70 km thick, and on the far side, 100 km.
Under the sea, it's thinner, and under the highlands, it's thicker.
More seas could be on the near side, as the crust is thinner. Lava rose to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories investigate what makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivational theory.
When directors begin to lead their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they can begin to behave in one of two ways. On the one hand, the effort is present to remain “one of the boys” (or girls).
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing the effectiveness of workers, assigning tasks and claiming responsibility for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and chart the course in his own way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They usually have more freedom than regular group members, as their groups have to adapt to multiple time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not listen to.
Another characteristic component of the virtual group is the presence of a real “invisible group” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
“Invisible team” is a management team that is reported by individual members. An invisible team sets standards for each member individually.
Why should an organization undergo a time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? The transfer of the concepts of organizational learning into practice is aimed at, among other things, innovation.
Once the operating departments of the organization effectively use the available resources, creativity and ingenuity can begin.
Thus, a new innovative process can be created in the process of cooperation within the organization in order to overcome obstacles, which will meet the needs of the clients.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish an innovative environment and promote shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) interprets the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. So they narrow down the research field and significantly increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports theses in the research of scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand how processes take place in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of the machine.
Research in the field of AI includes the production of tasks automation machines that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and making schedules, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and identifying handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is embedded in numerous PC and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every lesson. Teachers would be happy to take students to places that can not be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution by performing virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire art right in the classroom.
Publishing an excursion report online is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the nation’s capital each year, redesign the site each year, but the old versions remain online and serve as a memorial album.
Web diaries can help students improve their writing style. Although most students start writing a blog with sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students can often be the most demanding audience, the writer of the blog begins to try to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs "forces students to be better aware of the world around them." The need to attract audience interest inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Keeping a blog is a tool that encourages the participation and effort of students to learn even when they are not in school.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can determine their position relative to the records of others and shape their view of specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a number of art galleries and museums featuring Canada’s past and present.
Slightly to the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are found the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka with its hinterland.
All this and much more puts the province of Ontario at the forefront as something that is considered to be typical Canadian among foreigners.
Extensive areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The population comparison seems surprising to many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and separate continent, considering its animal and plant worlds.
The smaller islands are mostly independent countries or linked to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this territory, which was strongly established in the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonization dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found his way from Europe to India around Africa.
The region borders the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: All female travelers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (but not one that is already worth a lot in appearance.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give the impression that it is harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Refuse strongly and do not be afraid to defend your point of view (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
The modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name Anfa as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan Sultan, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around ancient Medina, it is not difficult to find places where they sell traditional Moroccan delicacies, such as tagine, pottery and leather products, water taps and a wide range of geegawas, but all this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the center of the city.
Although Goma is safe enough, trips outside Goma should be explored to understand the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the best mountain gorilla tracking options in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by bode-bode (taxi - engine). For a short drive at the usual (local) price you will be charged about 500 Congolese francs.
Since it is also quite difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, remote lands.
Although it is a tourist attraction and has an airport, Timbuktu is now a poor city.
In 1990, because of the danger of desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites.
He was one of the main stops of the special show of PBS Henry Louis Gates "Miracles of the African World".
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic touch than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological areas, each supporting a different group of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
You must pay a daily entrance fee to preserve the nature and tour the park, as in any South African national park.
It might be a bad idea to buy a Wild Card pass that provides access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and is the main destination for many tourists.
The type of buildings that make up the silhouette of the city of Hong Kong are associated with a gleaming column chart, highlighted by the presence of waters of Victoria Harbour Bay.
For the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Urban development on the Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated in re-connected territory off the north coast.
This place was taken by the British colonialists as their own, so this is a good starting point to see the remains of the colonial past of the area if you are interested.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once outgrew the Gangetic lowlands.
Sundarbans covers 3,850 km2 of large area, about a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, with an estimated population of 400 Bengal tigers and an estimated 30,000 readers.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, and most, especially those to the east and Jakarta/Bumthang, from 6.30 to 7.30.
Since long-distance buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and sturdy.
By sharing taxis, you can quickly and comfortably travel to nearby cities such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two 3.5 meters wide passages.
The bridge stands 15 meters high. It was built in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guarani, who lived as full-time hunters and also engaged in self-sufficient agriculture, were the most important indigenous group that resided in the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes lived in the Chaco region, such as the Guaycura and the Payagua, which made a living by hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes called the "Great Indian Province", developed in the 16th century as a result of a meeting of Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the city of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and pole players in the world.
The biggest tournament of this year will be held in December at the polo courts in Las Ca?itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen throughout the year.
You can find tournament news and information on how to buy tickets for polo matches at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), and its value is set at the equivalent of the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted on almost all islands, and Stanley mostly accepts credit cards and US dollars.
They are not likely to accept credit cards on the outlying islands, but they may accept British and American currency; ask the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the currency before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in a subtropical zone; in summer temperatures often exceed +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but due to the mixture of wind and humidity, it seems colder than indicated by a thermometer.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" periods: the amount of rain throughout the year is almost the same.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wild animals are still wild, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park’s management, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife.
Buffaloes, Canadian deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, no matter how meek they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
In addition, you should know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so do not carry or cook food with a strong smell and maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a notorious naval showdown when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fighting for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of Tupua's supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland spreads across two ports, there are many coasts here. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in North Harbour County) lie along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe to swim in and are usually sown with New Zealand's pohutukawa Christmas trees providing shade.
Tamaki Drive is located in the port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a good offer of shops surrounding the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex, but a pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
You can enjoy a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are likely to take the route better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but it’s not hard to find bottled water if you’re scared.
Australians perceive “coffee with milk” as something foreign. Short black coffee is “espresso”, cappuccino is obtained with a generous amount of cream (not foamy milk), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Throughout the year, many hikers take to the ridge, and injuries that would result from any of these causes are few on the ridge.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the authorities, respect all signs and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps come close to beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be observed outside this time frame.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and drift away.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their original habitat is in the mouth of the river north of Rockhampton.
By making a reservation in advance, the traveler ensures that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches the chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with certain hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers and even shared air and hotel packages.
They may also hold your booking if you need to consider an offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all adjustments and wishes must first be communicated to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors opt for on-site camping, and most visitors find this to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you have to get there early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Although the music may be quiet on the main stages, it should be borne in mind that in some venues of the festival the music can still play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping sites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, look at where the cabin is located, because breaking through the ice causes a rather horrifying sound for those most sensitive.
Cruises from St. Petersburg include a stop in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos tend to put a lot of effort into giving their guests as much time and money as possible. There are usually no windows and hours, and the exits are difficult to find.
Their offer usually includes food, drinks and entertainment points to entertain visitors and keep them with you for as long as possible.
In some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price. Alcoholism, however, affects judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is bad and you can’t drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow or snow carried by the wind, or by condensate or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in everyday use means a land trip where we look at African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often approached by cars and can be viewed well with standard equipment.
Leos, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, so you’ll be able to see them more easily with binoculars.
A walk safari (also called a "destination walk", "hiking safari" or "walking") indicates a hike that can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Several events took place at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first being there in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you may be in a difficult position.
The cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus cancellation policies from late March do not apply to July 2020 when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, and regular tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes dries them faster. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards, if they are not present in the room itself.
If the iron is not at hand or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the goods (which can cause them to shrink or even osmode).
There are several methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough if you boil water for one minute, in other areas it should be boiled for several minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you have concerns, you should rather buy water in a closed bottle from a verified company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil foods, cause hypersensitivity or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually considered to be pests.
Duty-free shopping is the option to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers going to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often crosses isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on gravel roads, pay attention, as steepness, narrow paths and sharp curves prevail.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and later works, usually from 35 to 40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, however, the mobile signal here is much stronger than on many other sections of the route, e.g. to the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, as the cooked apples in the cakes are found throughout the year, and cherries and plums come in turn in the summer.
Most German pastries are also characterized by almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually especially paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a pastry that is small but rich, try something that depends on the region called a Berlin donut, pancakes or donut.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices in combination with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inner regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is widely used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of this subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is the general name for a wide range of local dishes found throughout the country, offering as many as 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional markers mostly means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a series of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese people love, peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability, but they can also pose a safety problem, as they can trap the rider’s legs.
If the horse throws the rider off and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrups, the horse could be dragged behind it in the event of an escape. To reduce this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety latches that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The Cocham Valley is the leading climbing destination in Chile with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs, which they call Yosemite of South America.
Climbers from all over the world are still establishing new routes in its walls with endless potential.
Snow skiing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve downhill skiing with skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity of travelers with many followers, sometimes called "tramp skiers", because they plan all the holiday around skiing in a certain location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date all the way back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called ski touring or cross-country skiing.
Although it does not usually contain elements of these disciplines, it is similar to touring alpine skiing or hiking, which are carried out on steep terrain and require much harder skis and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good weather conditions, you’ll be able to cover longer distances than you can by walking - but you’ll rarely reach the speed of touring skiing without a heavy backpack and tidy trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean that you need to apply for a visa several times and pass passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area acts as a single country.
Within this area, you can cross borders without going over the checkpoints again, where you should show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen Member State individually, saving you time, money and paperwork.
A universal definition that would determine which products are antiques does not exist. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies by geographical area, as in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as antique items, although they are younger than similar goods from serial production.
Deer breeding is an important source of income for the Sami, and the culture in which this industry is located is also important for other professions.
However, according to tradition, not all of the Sami bred reindeer on a large scale, but they made their living by fishing, hunting, and the like, with reindeer primarily being used for sledding.
Today, many of them work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sipmi region, the Somi area.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used, especially among the non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because of its links to negative stereotypes and incorrect notions about the Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of travel advice, it may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You might also want to turn to one of the governments that is not yours, but their advice is designed for its citizens.
For American citizens, for example, the situation in the Middle East will be different than for Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are just a brief summary of the political situation in each country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are a general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious disruption to society or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and we know several different species that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The forms and consequences of extreme weather conditions are strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, water trombones, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather conditions include snowstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to pay attention to any possible weather emergency in the area, as these may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that can be considered a war zone should get professional training.
If you are looking for a “hostile environment course” on the Internet, you will most likely get the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the problems mentioned here in much more detail, usually along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid procedures and occasionally weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are widespread, and publications about war zones are only a handful.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad should make sure they have valid travel documents with them.
Not all governments are willing to issue a passport with an unmarked gender (X) or documents with updated data on the desired name and gender.
There is also a difference in the willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents.
Security checkpoint inspections became much more disruptive in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people should not expect to survive the examination without invasion of privacy and with intact dignity before surgery.
Backflows are flows that return from waves that break along the coast, often on ridges or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the reverse flow on a few deeper sections is concentrated and a rapid flow towards the depth can be formed there.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue when swimming back upstream, which may be impossible.
When you manage to get out of the flow, swimming back will be no different than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you will not fall back, or depending on your skills and depending on whether you have been spotted, wait for rescuers.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (not such a long honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture can sometimes find it very difficult to re-adapt their own culture.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers had to get used to the new country.
Perhaps people do not expect that even travelers returning home should be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show with pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
Before the show starts, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually, the sound of tourists and sellers is always heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx represents the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The pyramids show scenes and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are part of several nations and have the most bases, of which 16 were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Scam Island, where a flooded caldera still serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a landscape south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here into a plateau, and then re-emerge as the 360-km Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is split by a glacier in Minnesota.
In the northern part of the Sentinelese mountain range is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising 4,892 meters high.
In remote places without a mobile signal, you may only be able to help yourself with a satellite phone.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make the call.
This service is widely used in shipping, including excursion vessels, as well as expeditions that need a service for remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider may provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off during school is travel and study.
It is especially popular with seniors, as it gives them a year off before they start their studies without having to sacrifice their education for it.
It often happens that education during a one-year stay abroad actually increases the likelihood of continuing the study of an individual in his home country.
It is usually necessary to pay a tuition fee to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. In addition, the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boating is a Finnish national sport, as every seventh or eighth person has a boat.
It is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most special Baltic cruises involve an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that when visiting the historic city, you can stay for a few days all day, and at night you can return to the ship and sleep there.
If you go to the mainland only by boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in the brochures mention Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience, no matter how old people are or where they come from, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of this, as it is no different from personal fear and resistance to other things that afflicts many people.
Understanding a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens in flight can help some overcome the fear of the unknown or lack of control.
Courier services are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, it is very important for business documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repair time.
Larger companies have their own aircraft for some routes, and for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they send things by air freight, it may take several days on some routes to explain and customs things.
The only way to get them through faster is to send them as checked baggage. The airline policies do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to reach deep into your pocket for the privilege (or rather, have your business do it for you).
This is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for the business class than for the economy class and for the first class eleven times more!
On direct flights from point A to point B, there is generally no point in looking for discounts for seats in business or first class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain central group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The official language is Romanian, and Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been rocked by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member.
During these parts of Moldova, economic ties were re-established despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir has a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub of the third largest city in Turkey.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and vibrant business center, which is concentrated around a giant bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide alleys, buildings with glass facades and a modern shopping center make the company of a traditional brick roof, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvok offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and an unusual octagonal church can also be found in it.
On some of the tombs in the churchyard are interesting marble statues of dovetails.
It is worth sacrificing half an hour for a walk around this interesting village.
To the north and quite accessible is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was famous among foreigners when Lord Byron wrote such a dazzling description of its beauty.
The bus Scotturb 403 regularly drives to Sintra and stops in Cabo da Roca.
In the north you can also visit the beautiful Shrine of Mary in Fatima (holy place), a place of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Keep in mind that you are actually in a mass grave as well as a place that has almost unimaginable significance for a large proportion of the world’s population.
Many men and women who have spent their time there are still alive, and many more whose loved ones were murdered there or worked there to the death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Behave with dignity, seriousness and respect, as appropriate. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not destroy the place by marking or scratching graffiti into buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost all can also speak Spanish.
Most of the characters are only in Catalan, which is defined by law as the first official language.

Regular notifications on the metro are only in Catalan, and unforeseen disruptions are communicated in different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often mistaken, in Paris you will still get along best with good behavior by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make your journey much easier.
The apparent aberration of the Parisians will quickly fade away if you show some basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its diverse microclimate, different soils and altitude, it is known for its wide range of plant communities.
This area offers a home to many different species of animals and birds.
Here you can find rare animals such as brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and wild rooster, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts that extend over their knees, and should also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer robes to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it is of vivid colors, you will make a monk or nun laugh at the entrance.
Men should also wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow these at the entrance, but you should know that they are not washed after each use, so you may not be most comfortable wearing them. For men, a universal size is available.
Majorca cuisine, like the cuisines of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all possible additives such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital initial, even in the middle of sentences.
This is an important way to separate certain verbs and objects.
In addition, it should also make it easier to read, although this makes it somewhat difficult to write, because it is necessary to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in its basic form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
You should pay particular attention to the letters c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.

Those who speak little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough for her not to have to learn it separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern period are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not as a problem in their golden age as it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and are easier to reach than those built later.
Most modern research telescopes are huge buildings in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observation of cherry blossoms or hanami has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.
In Japan, the first parties under the cherry trees were hosted by the emperor, and he arranged them for himself and the other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.

Several buses also run north to Hebron, a traditional burial ground for the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and his wives.
Check if the bus you want to take takes you to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good red thread for organizing travel.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting towns along the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.

Many of the customs associated with this festival have also been adopted by unbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians throughout the world.
According to tradition, it is necessary to spend Easter in an exposed place and wait for the sunrise.
For this tradition, of course, there are Christian theological explanations, but it can also be a pre-Christian spring ritual and a fertility ritual.
In more traditional churches, Easter vigils are often held on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, where at midnight the assembly often turns into a celebration of Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that came to the islands first came here, swam here, flew here, or came here.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since man came to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will be offered a good opportunity to see the polar sheen, because during this period the darkness is more or less all day long.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and most of the time there are no problems with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
The working culture in Japan is perhaps more hierarchical and formal than the accustomed Westerners.
Dresses are a standard business uniform, and co-workers call each other by last name or title at work.
In the workplace, harmony is essential, and team effort is more important than the glorification of individual achievements.
Often, employees are required to obtain approval from their superiors for each decision and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without dispute.
