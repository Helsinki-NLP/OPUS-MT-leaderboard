Members of the Welsh Assembly worry they "look like muppets"
Some of the members of the Assembly were stunned by the proposal to change their title to "CHUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members from across the political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause for ridicule.
One Labour member has said his group is alarmed that the new name "roms with Dumb and Woodblower."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one Plaid party member, the entire group "is not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A representative for the Welsh Conservative Party has indicated that his group is "not biased" towards the name change, but notes that the new name PVP (English: MWP) bears a certain verbal resemblance to a "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start being called the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers "members of the Parliament of Wales, in short "the PPP", but the "CUP" option has received the most support after a public consultation.
The members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but reaching a consensus is clearly going to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill on the change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their state's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the country's name, has said he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the country is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent amid the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“If you look at it from a historical perspective, according to the old people I was talking to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner,” Adams said.
"Both are missing today."
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways today," he added.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not be enough for as long as the executives expected, "and sooner or later they would be in the same situation."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks housing people who do not help the neighborhood's other sanctuaries survive.
"The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers are going to visit them."
Both churches were built of white pastimes before Harlem became a neighborhood of blacks - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the years after 1930.
The building then became the property of the neighborhood's black residents.
St. Martin's was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against the 125th Street retailers, which is Harlem's main market street, as they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, in which they ordered the bells.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly calls them "the slum bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool".
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Nguyen of the University of Michigan, has also noted that it was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather mentions that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought in by the secular leaders of the church and others by an episcopal diocese.
From the vestry - which is the governing body of the congregation consisting of secular leaders - they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese "would have been willing to transfer the costs to the vestry", although it had no role in hiring the architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the diocese's lack of transparency.
13-year-old boy injured by shark in lobster hunt in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he overheard the boy screaming for help and rushed along with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammall first thought the child had caught a lobster and got excited, then realized he was yelling "It bit me!
He bit me!"
Hamel says that when he reached the boy, he found out that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water because there’s a shark!” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radio Children's Hospital in San Diego, where she was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was judged not to be of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to her upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury’s is planning an offensive in the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury faces off against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty product stands at its sites where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the UK’s 2.8 billion-pound beauty market offensive, which continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest beauty stalls to date will be located in 11 stores across the country, after which, if the initiative is successful, similar ones will be found in more outlets.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the shelves, until recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it will double the number of beauty products offered to 3,000, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to offerings in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up range so that most products can be used by vegans, something that younger consumers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will trial discount programs at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily at convenient moments leads to supermarkets having to put in more effort to attract shoppers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to crack down on Aldi and Lidl discounters by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos stores in hundreds of stores, as well as opening Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which the company says has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket chain to redesign its beauty and pharmaceutical facilities was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint attempt with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-site pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve transformed the look and character of our beauty stands to enhance our customers’ overall experience.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
Our range of brands aims to meet every taste and every need in an enchanting setting with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's refusal to sign 11-million-pound deal
Dragons star Peter Jones "gets mad" after TV host Holly Willoughby quit an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the brand of household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" has announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones "boiling" after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - all to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV's "golden girl" admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant there would no longer be time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, with rumours being that it has doubled Willoughby's fortune, the value of which is projected to be 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boils absolutely all completely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on a Tuesday so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at the Marlowe headquarters that's full of products waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of "This Morning", which is one of the UK's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and also could lead to a delay in bringing the brand to market.
Last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby herself co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who is 52, joining as chairman of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby would become the brand's "ambassador" for M&S and would also replace Ann McParlin as host of the "I'm a Celebrity" show on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Difficult negotiations leading to a "warming of relations"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news channels for making comments that someone would find "unsuitable for the president" and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his humorous "journalistic" way.
“I did not give up anything.”
He noted that Kim has shown interest in a second meeting since the first took place in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as a "big step towards the abolition of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
However, negotiations to eliminate these weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal attitude" from the United States towards his country's first steps on the path to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful,” he said.
“We are at war with this country.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - suspending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the bodies of US servicemen home.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravage island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal view that international aid is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
National disaster agency spokesman Mr Sutopo announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery effort.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common sight along other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Until recently, a hospital ship stationed in Lombok to service the victims of the earthquake was heading to Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's backward infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign by investing large amounts of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko is heading to the polls again next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs battled the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge brings a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 metres from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot, then fired a precision shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed to the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the loaded Kepa Arisabalag and entangled herself unscathed in the net.
“I’ve tried to get a good grip on the ball because players like Shack are always looking for forward passes, so I just tried to buy myself as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I pushed the ball and I just shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The striker of the "blues" passed with a heel to Matteo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovačić exchanged a quick double pass in the center.
He then released a quick shot pass that put Hazard in a clean position in the penalty area.
Hazard outscored the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the country on Friday and led to waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu with a population of over 380,000 is dotted with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's remains were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from a Grayson Meuse stabbing on John Street, with a 32-year-old man suspected of having been arrested.
Police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I'm begging anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have captured something with their dashboard cameras, to contact us as they may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends, who consider the woman to be their acquaintance, arrived on the scene and inquired where she had been found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Meuse tried to go home to his apartment, but was notified by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they were allowed to return.
One police officer reported to a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman.
She continues to repeat "it's so awful".
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the cordon while another van remained outside.
In the cordon are police officers who monitor the apartment block.
All persons with information are requested to contact @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes Latest Memorial Hit by 'Rewriting History'
Her ban would be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "foolishness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "It was inevitable in the current debate that the removal of statues of Oliver Cromwell to Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of historiography of a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more so in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate presentation is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the mid-17th-century conflict that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable face that represents one side of the ensuing division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
Killer Pig Injures Deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer had been preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines in May 30, 2005 in Xinyi from Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next manor open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the pigsty with a blood-stained zurla.
Forensic expertise has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer fatally, the report said.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and disfigured," said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer animal didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager reported to Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the scene.
It was also reported that Yuan's family and market management were negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, pigs that attack humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with the man critically injured after the attack.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that the pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of the blood could act as a "trigger".
“They are just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But you have to treat them with respect,” the man concluded.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa will cause frequent and heavy rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cool waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Sunday morning Eastern Time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching syncline will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris-carrying streams, and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will result in rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and gusts of wind.
The approaching syncline will cause heavy rains in some parts of California's southern coast.
It is possible to get precipitation of more than half an inch, which will lead to weathered small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October could bring big temperature fluctuations to the U.S. as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a nearly 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched the fascinating spectacle of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blacy Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued, with networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the final minutes of Friday: an agreement that was settled by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and under which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was making out with her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely that even more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available data for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has traditionally struggled with measuring the number of people watching from their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him booing protesters on Friday as he tried to catch an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During the whole harassment for several minutes, he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he represents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that they had already come out of his office with a statement, and before the doors of the elevator were closed he announced that he would make an additional decision during the hearing by the commission.
Cable and broadcast networks provided tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats in the opposition insist.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several Senators, Flack made a decision.
His election was certainly essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political interference' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically playing tricks" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the front page of the newspaper, her previous foreign minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Play Plan" for Brexit, making a suggestion that Britain's collection of customs fees for the EU and vice versa is "completely absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest suspect Dithian Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dittian Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Officers found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shot against Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to an attorney.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Office of Forensics released a preliminary report on Friday that cited a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The State Department expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police Crime Lab, and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for "timely justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6 foot and 6 inch tall player was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "collapsed" and "in shock" following Wade's death.
Wade has said that "it's something that worries a person all the time."
Volcano Spreads Ashes Over Mexico City
Popocatepetl's ash ejected from the volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater rose and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has seen numerous tremors and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed a thin layer of dust covering car windshields in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, such as Hokimilko.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, which is also known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of a polarising vote to secede from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed in by the gendarmerie, began throwing eggs and powder paint at peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually teeming with tourists.
Later in the day, other skirmishes with police occurred, with police resorting to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups screamed "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while pro-independence groups responded with "Spain forever."
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region even a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although activity was low as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop a vote at polling stations in the region with a series of violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined a separatist protest with his wife, says he has no hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be at a standstill.”
Despite the important victory, even with a small margin, in the regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan political parties are struggling this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or have been arrested pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who has recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that he is “getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested pending trial last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
He argued that "my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing by the Spanish government."
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday at around 7:30pm UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has announced that there has been damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Premier League newcomer Livingston surprised Rangers and inflicted only a second loss on Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as the club's manager from the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be decisive, and the team of Gary Holt equalized points with the second in the Hibernian standings.
Gerard's team remained without a win at home in the Premier League this season, and the following Sunday faced the Harts leader, from whom they trailed by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without a loss in the league, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the uninvited guests
Holt's team had to lead the way long before scoring, and his direct playing style made it extremely difficult for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his shot went sideways, after which Alan Lithgow fired past the post after Craig Halkett returned the ball head-to-head.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they can seriously hamper guests from static positions.
And this is how the winning goal came about.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingstone played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining with each other and bringing out Menga, who led the ball and scored from midfield.
Until now, the Rangers owned the ball more, but faced the impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Rangers goaltender saved a foot shot by Scott Pittman, and a head shot by Little went past the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the penalty area of Livingston rained centering, which, however, were easily cleared, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of guests for a penalty - first after a single match between Halkett and the reserve Glen Middleton, and then in suspicion of playing with his hand.
"Phenomental" by Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at "Tony Macaroni Arena"
It's a phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team played just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and composition have hardly undergone any changes since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he has transformed the team since his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb manner, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warrell under pressure all the time.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard’s leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were way below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once managed to split the defense of the hosts - this loss should wake Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, yet many supporters flocked around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's own policies and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the fault caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Deptford Road Crash: Cyclist Dies After Collision
A cyclist has died after a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical attention arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located nearly a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and would then notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in mutiny
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the Prison Service reported.
The mutiny broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to contain it, special officers from the Tordano squad were called in, who would have to deal with eight prisoners, such as the mutiny itself in a confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the persons and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained officers have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we very clearly state that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after an inmate attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to control a heavy mutiny in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although the arid areas may benefit)
It’s rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but there’s a good chance that’s what’s going to happen early next week as the weakening Hurricane Rosa drifts through the desert to the southwest, bringing with it a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already set up anti-flood stations Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finisk on Tuesday, with rain likely in late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that "since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in individual locations.
For those who are not at risk of flash floods, Rosa-induced rain can actually be a blessing as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwest is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Period Monitoring Commission, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second-worst severity category.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning can still boast a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to reach land at Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be heavy and lead to a significant risk of overruns.
“Average rainfall of up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora is expected, with up to 10 inches possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa would then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste-bearing streams in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area at around 04:00 UK time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition remained "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock district, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "suffered by the vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering from the treachery and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emphatically rejecting Christine Blacy Ford's accusation of sexual assault from decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution's hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "today the American people witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Cavanaugh.
"Every vote in favor of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote in favor of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation in the public service," the president told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
“Although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually a candidate,” Trump said.
"That's why I'm running and fighting for good candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves a mission “to prevent and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican official.
Hundreds die after Indonesia quakes and tsunamis, death toll rises
At least 384 people have lost their lives after many were swept away by giant waves when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at nightfall the coast was swept by waves up to six metres (18 ft) high, carried many to their deaths and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami struck after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had dragged cars, trees, whole houses, it struck everything in its path," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and were able to escape from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Images released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, and a water-surrounded mosque.
Secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The statement also mentioned that the geographic location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area that is called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
He also added that "communications have been completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers are already heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for failing to inform about the Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media showed a man upstairs yelling panic warnings at people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore and takes away both cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but those evacuated are still in desperate need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala were able to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in tarpaulin shelters stretched out in the courtyard of their office, they passed by a number of scenes of devastation, Mr Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen countless destroyed houses.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the work started on rescue and recovery emergency groups, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, sending personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at a regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has declared that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status."
As Palu falls on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional load," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel had reached the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants in Palu who had participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 while charging an ATM in Levi's Newport
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Levy's Newport, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continued, but police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Yee.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote, "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Yee for some time and has used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change is ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who gave up "for emotional reasons," the show's creator tells us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional title, West has previously argued that the word has religious significance to him.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’ or ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It has gone from Kanye, which means only one person, simply to Yea, which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and titles, including Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the nicknames Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's previous collaborators, Jay Z, has also performed in a variant with or without hyphen and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force, as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.""
Soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with leftist political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador took an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its AI funding.
As China becomes more active on the AI front, the U.S. should double its research budget, according to AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the U.S. government made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. as a whole does not have an official AI strategy.
During this time, China presented its plan as early as last year: the country is aiming to become number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the U.S. and are about to make further AI breakthroughs,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could also double the chances that the next big AI achievement will come from the U.S., as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, Lee worked on an AI system that beat the most successful otello player in America, then served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee credited previous technology competitions to the federal government, such as the robotics competition of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be helpful in recognizing the new visionaries.
“Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking away academics, it’s taking away corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think AI doctors should be offered green cards automatically,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott it casts a shadow of doubt whether the referendum will succeed in reaching the minimum 50 percent required for recognition of its validity.
The question on the ballot reads as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-Yugoslav country Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have ruled that they will comply with the result of it to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two-thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gyose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents, stretched by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the servant's door," Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of a Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as the unemployment rate in the country is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after releasing his own vote.
The State Secretary also said that the positive result would lead to "affirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, Macedonia's Institute for Political Studies published results of a survey that said between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - which is below the required activity.
Another survey by Macedonian television Telma revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it gained power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defence and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defence and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine scorer was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outscored three Brighton defenders before sprinting the ball into the empty space ahead.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest at the border of Brighton's penalty area.
He then passed left to Stirling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-footed shot over Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We wanted him to play 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score at this point.”
But it was Sterling who secured the initial advance of the "sky blues" in this Premier League game of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the goal Aguero received a pass deep into half of Brighton.
He immediately dropped a draw pass on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Stirling with a pass on the far post.
The striker of the "sky blues" was able to detect closely, shortly before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
After the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, it makes little sense for another game of starting pitcher.
Still, the ever-ambitious Scherzer hopes to be the starter on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the game is relevant to the Rockies, who lead by one game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies guaranteed themselves participation in at least a "wild card" game after a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first division title.
“Although we don’t fight for anything, we want to end the season with a good game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it is supposed to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is crucial.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he held practice on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia.
The president narrowly hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
“This is one of the biggest moments in our history, and I also say that while I’m not a candidate, I’m actually participating, and that’s why I’m fighting hard for the right candidates,” Trump said.
And then he went on to say, “You all see this scary, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself witness their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to run over in order to cling to power and government, because they are only interested in power and government, but we will not give them.”
The Democrats, in the president's words, have set themselves the goal of "obstructing and hindering."
"What we've all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling Democrats "angry, nasty, vile and untrue."
The president reminded of the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong booing from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I waited - it was really bad sign language - maybe the worst I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer broad-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak out.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour member of parliament who’s been told he’s not welcome, just because I’m being blunt.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment as she decisively stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the time of previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting notice on Friday said that "we wish the meetings to include everyone and to be fruitful".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a "lighter and measured" policy have long been forgotten, if ever they were on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that differing views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on how much the party leadership liked it.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, while colleagues I used to think shared similar political views began expecting me to take a turn and take positions I would never agree with - be it on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements - no matter what I say - there is a whole offensive tirade on social networks, where it is called for recall, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I was even more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me are at least mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist taunts every day without being intimidated by them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics was how such insults became the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer broad-minded, with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received numerous advices to keep calm, not to talk so much, and that “everything will be fine then.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago, as a student driven by Thatcher's government, which through its neglect led to the literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I never hid my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported Friday’s proposal, I would like to say that when the state is pushing for Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in reality my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of recall or political ostracisation will prevent me from acting in the way I consider best in the defence of your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The unbeaten Air lead the standings
The two late essays may have changed the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Premier League match at Tennent.
The team already tops the standings and the only one of the ten teams is without loss so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the game, which coach Peter Murchie and his team can be very pleased with.
“I am happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past games and we are still without a loss,” Murchie said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their situation better than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful extra kick by Frazier Klimo, led Air forward in the score, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the score after Jason Bagot realised an essay followed by an unsuccessful extra kick.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick shortly before half-time, scoring an essay after a solo action, and then also making the extra kick, making the score 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra kick by Bagot, reduced the lead to just five points.
A prolonged stoppage of play followed due to a severe injury to Ruarid Nott, who was taken out on a stretcher, and after the game resumed, Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowall and a successful extra kick by Klimo.
Air's acting captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and realising an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful extra kick.
However, the hosts regained the presence of spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent penalty play McPherson realized an essay using Air's advancing offensive line.
Climo realized the extra kick, and not long after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and led winger Gregor Henry on the flank for the hosts' fifth essay.
The Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be heading into a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, of which he is also the scriptwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was intent on getting involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia’s landlocked hope that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are constantly patrolling the sea headquarters in La Paz.
There is an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to take it back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet handed down to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive - as is the call to sail the Pacific again.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"The power is in Bolivia, everywhere there is a sense of serenity and unity, and the country expects a positive result," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic local president facing a contentious re-election battle next year, has also staked much and much on the court’s judgment on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific,” Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court ruling in Bolivia's favor is quite small. And even if it ruled in its favor, it would not change things into reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to take over the territory of Chile and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case is "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually harmed it.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been exacerbated by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales' belligerent rhetoric had wiped out what little good will remained of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to conduct a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not held diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltse, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have the "incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefit for both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales - who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - had used the ocean access problem as a "political crutch".
“Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it won't resume nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go nuclear first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri called it "empty hope" the idea that continuing with U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would cause the North to fall to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which it sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest scream in massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, there is no need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that wowed the catwalk during Paris Fashion Week.
The rather impractical hats triggered a surge on Instagram in the summer, with designers sending their eye-catching creations to wow the fashion community.
Valentino’s standout offering was an extravagant beige hat with feather-like wide brims that literally devoured the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included jewelry-adorned watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not meant to keep you warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of haute couture as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a diving gear complete with a snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted cone of ice cream.
If you like these trends, you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats came soon after La Bomba, the straw hat with a two-foot circumference that was seen on everyone’s heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social media led to the appearance of another huge design of the catwalk - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the one wearing a swimsuit.
The orange-coloured raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the all-seeing item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - after the designer made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another superb performance of exam scores, which was only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words reach them.
But if you speak in his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
With the results of this year’s exams, we see that languages are the first with the highest success rate for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the high grade A.
The data, which was collected from 74 members of SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students achieved a grade of A in Chinese, with the same grade having 72% of the German, 69% of the French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same treatment as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that of the reasons employers struggle to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
As a result, foreign language proficiency is becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require foreign language proficiency, making these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person learns a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one breast ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to hold a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reaches a double-digit percentage with an indicator of 15%.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ in terms of languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child may have, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the team's first game of pre-season preparation against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
"He'll be on the pitch between one and 48 minutes," Walton jokingly announced via the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies that include stops in familiar places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing a confirmatory vote on his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm election as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time will the Trump rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions arose over allegations of immoral sexual acts that held the Senate confirmation vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation was under way.
The main purpose of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Controlling Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are launching a campaign season full of commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit this month to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Raider Cup 2018: Team USA will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue "foursome" matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what the Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is a rather subjective concept, which, however, players believe unreservedly, especially in races like this one.
So, which team is in the best position right now?
"They led by six points, and now it's only four, so I guess we've gained some momentum," said Jordan Speight at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve to distribute.
However, as Spite says, the Americans still have a lot to show and their fans should not lose hope, if we have to judge by the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speed shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
Fans' cheers grew stronger as he advanced into the round, in which he tied the score in the fourth match with Thomas trailing by two strokes after the first two holes.
His punch, which won them the match at the 15th hole, was met with strong ecstatic reactions, which lead us to believe that really all is not lost for the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” says Spite.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speight and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four and it seems everything works out for them.
"Mollywood" were the only couple who did not make "gods" on Sunday afternoons, but they also did not have "gods" on either Saturday mornings, or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, as well as the way energy seemed to flow between them and enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory as the sun sets over "Le Golf National".
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European fame turned out to be a bit premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly handled Sergio Garcia, the hero of "fourball" matches from the morning as he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Boggy" and two "doubles" of the first nine holes got the Spaniard and the Swede into problems they failed to deal with.
On Sundays, there is no one else to solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "foursome" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
Europeans played better team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "foursome" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last - something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe lead by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the games from the "fourball" and "foursome" formats on Saturday.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, bringing their assets at the Le Golf National race to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to "Hazeltine" two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning's "fourball" games over the Americans, who made a mistake after a mistake, and ultimately Europe won the series by 3-0 wins.
The United States put up more resistance in "foursome" matches, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furrick's team needed 8 points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first rookie from Europe to earn four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to earn four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After pitting Woods and Patrick Reid in the "fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambu by an even more definite score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, has only occasionally demonstrated outbursts of his genius, but so far has had 19 losses from 29 games in "fourball" and "foursome" games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, given a break for the morning's "fourball" games, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the "foursome" clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copca - number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy an entirely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the Americans' hopes by earning two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2-1 win against Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in "fourball" matches, and later came back to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in "foursome" meetings, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team made up a four-point deficit before the singles, with Furik's team keeping the trophy even in a draw under the regulation.
However, after being outplayed on two consecutive days, their chances for a turnaround on Sunday do not seem to be particularly high.
North Korea says 'no way' to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening distrust of the United States and there was no way the country could give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the UN's annual general assembly, Ri Yong-hou said "significant measures of goodwill" had been taken over the past year, for example halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri expressed North Korea's familiar grievances about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to eliminating nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking staged measures, his statement seemed significant as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula" and Trump gave guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. said Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘abolishing nuclear weapons first’ and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even objects to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump is planned, about which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a standstill.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles at the U.S. mainland was inevitable after the "evil president" Trump called Kim a "man-missile" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final, and confirmed nuclear disarmament has taken place."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to stop funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year causes all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning "all night" using caffeine.
A professor found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t even think about it when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Eisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the most essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke."
The culture of pride in "all-night learning" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" in combating stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he says - even in order to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation brings the brain into a starvation mode, causing them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaiser prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaiser recommends that students think about whether to set a bedtime and wake-up alarm and know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeated the team of Gerard
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kick broke Steven Gerrard's unbeaten team and brought a 1-0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest of the February triumph with a 4-0 over St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, which left his team eight points short of the breakaway Harts team, leader in the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers' devoid of constructive ideas at no point seemed close to leveling.
After the match Rangers slipped to sixth place, and Livingston are already third, trailing second Hibernian only by goal difference.
There may also be additional problems for Rangers, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Eyre in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same eleven at Livingston, which drew a point against Harts last week, and should have been pleased with the way his aggressive team parried all the opponent's actions.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better on the rarer occasions when they owned it.
They had to score in the second minute when Menga led Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor with one touch, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later centering on Keegan Jacobs from a foul found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow deflected the ball away from the back beam.
Rangers took control of the game but failed to create anything meaningful in the final third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should have been a penalty in the 15th minute when he clashed with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
Rangers only made two straight shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly handled Lasana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovi Edzaria's weak shot easily.
Although Livy's 34th-minute goal was surprising in terms of possession, it was well deserved.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who in cold blood passed to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to a result when the winger passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the hit.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play in a host-friendly style of play, with Lithgow and Halket continually weaning the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last minutes, but McGregor was able to handle Jacobs' shot, and in the ensuing corner, Lithgow fired his head past the beam.
Rangers' Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty at the end of the game after a one-fight with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENNE... the day that the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A crumbling stone in science since then, the Geiger counter also became a cornerstone of pop culture when the film The Bells of Coronado was released in 1950, featuring seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Certainly you care right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may train immune system to 'see' foreign cells
New cancer vaccine could train immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are re-injected into the patient
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting them into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells was used in treating a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat reading "Let's Make America Great Again", while participating in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat reading "Let's Make America Great Again", he spoke out against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Commission on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not aired, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told, “Don’t go out with that hat on.”
I've been bullied!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he would put on his Superman costume because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
The comments caused at least twice booing from the audience and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them telling, "The whole studio went silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP AGAINST THE MOUNTAIN."
However, talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "being himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothing or supporting his 'art') who I think welcomes and propagates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "being officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name to symbol.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the prosecutor’s office.
'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harrington Opposes Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for playing the swinging sword John Snow in the NGO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31, has spoken out against the macho character's stereotype, saying that showing such roles on screen leads young people to often think they have to be "crude" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels "firmly convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
“At the moment, I am personally firmly convinced - what have we done wrong in terms of masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach young men about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street, which makes boys feel that they need to become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because obviously something is confusing for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in a prequel or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, claiming that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
As of November, Kit will be starring in Sam Shepard's reenactment of True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that getting to know his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and defined my life from now on,” he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities is widespread.
Studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican party senators' data, decrying "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned accusations that a member of her team had posted personal information to three state senators from Republicans on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and sites of the "ultra-right wing".
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina state senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, published by an unknown Capitol official during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my team - whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“There is anger in this denial,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to criticism from the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Essentially, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had approached the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they are brought to justice for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Review of "Johnny English Breaks Out Again" - the Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British-made film, and it seems that this also applies to the resurgence of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English - which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and came back in 2011 with "Johnny English is Back".
Will self-mocking and facial expressions that say how obvious we are become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes wide open and his "rubber" face, has the permission to renew things a second time - his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation, designed for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who despite his quirky claims of flattering glamour owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr Bean and much of the man who contributed one note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the leaving chaos behind traveler and international man whom Atkinson played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials.
There are two good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and briefly the fins snarled in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English's wacky mishaps are not, in my opinion, innovative and focused, as Actinson's lack of play reminds Mr. Bean.
The usual assumption is that the UK is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked Britain’s top-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all the operatives to the on-duty agent’s horror, unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is giving her all for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she must summon some retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a chic center, but who is illegally teaching lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunited with his former long-time sidekick Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a jolly role in which Vicky Pepperdine's talent is little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's Secret Service and confront the fatal beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but since they are so cute and lush, there is a lot more content intended for children here.
Very mediocre production.
As with the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies it is working out a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan for Britons to work four weeks but get paid five.
The party says it wants company bosses to provide workers with the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend but receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the economic program and the party's plans to shake up the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times, "A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"It won't happen right away, but the four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy is not being considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to unveil his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "faceless executives" and "speculators" at the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current owners of stakes in water companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose "deductibles" based on the violations found.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private firms to employees who can amass annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy speak to "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause some of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that, we need a groundbreaking indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasius Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive cast of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the large lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get to know the real purpose of the event - eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending a non-email to a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is a "Global Citizen" 12 years before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people think they're doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have pushed for multiple different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds have already directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based partnership between investors and performers, a commitment to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 Twitter posts were received from "global citizens".
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into simply a historical memo,” Ambassador Tracy Ullman told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling for Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has reported funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", that will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
“A global citizen” replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fail and still fail.
But just like the great civil rights movement and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces to 'block' and impede energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria - specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zinc addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement," he said, while describing Russia as a "one-number pony," with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says turns Berlin into a "hostage."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take 2020 presidential run seriously, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "take seriously" the run for president after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women in Washington to come in and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take the presidential run seriously."
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m as worried as Donald Trump is about our democracy,” she said.
Warren was blunt in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll conducted on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other Democratic Party senior officials discussed regarding a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD to Trak Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after I return is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, hardened, come back and wonder if they'll get that respect that they and their brothers-in-arms have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, he was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the judicial challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and counties filed a goodwill petition in Washington to support asylum seekers and contest the policy, NBC News reported.
It was not revealed the full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of the violent members of his gang" had mistreated her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the United States, as nations facing pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined according to specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle," the report said in good faith.
In addition, lawyers said in the report that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Refugees are given to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his July 11 announcement on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even not all the serious ones, that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said, pacifying her sick boy at an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage some of their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwy Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to ongoing aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled how he felt the violent earthquake in the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I think I was pushed into the broken wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with the family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she stopped talking.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page advertisement in an American daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of China Daily in Des Moines Register, Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Peki is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they are leveling import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the US and China at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "is currently doubling this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the government of China has taken advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and press by running paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people may have regarding China's troubling economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh’s pogrom, Republicans push voters away from women for midterm elections, analysts warn
With many of the top Republicans backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this one are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with a vote.
These things cannot be taken back," Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasius Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be turned off,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say the problem is already serious; it’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans insisted on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican Party National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee voting, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench. It’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on who to trust as a result of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more leaning toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her Yale studies in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to attack Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said in regards to the venture.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online personal data repository" or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It resembles Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about an online personal data repository is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "giving power to personal data."
The idea behind Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all their business models are completely refreshed overnight.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence in the net neutrality debate.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this new era on the internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
It marks 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his involvement in World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honours.
A commemorative monument was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the monument to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very thick fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
He later attacked the firing line and with "incredible bravery" led the line forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that it was "a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead received a Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally not being able to witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six from the main map and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying up until the early hours, especially because of the match.
Fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
“The government regulates that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was replaced with a children’s show,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said he would work on planning the meetings to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetition, we can solve the problem," Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't him. It was the government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to including five matches instead of six - as we usually do. We tried to provide more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "less" because of his sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman claimed that until he started studying in middle school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's long-time host, Kirsty Young, has been in the hospital for several months.
In participating in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, "To date, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he does this because he is happy to be able to live openly, without consequences, and wants to instill "hope" in others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - it "surprised him."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he first participated in the Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs."
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly himself says that his "whole worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you I was only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be there for me, Dad, or in the front row,’” he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment, when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that all my life I had dreamed of doing this - jumping at the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home.
This also inspired the selection of his first song - "Proud" by Heather Small - which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him shudder.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m., British Summer Time.
Lost form Mickelson remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be tied for failure.
Mikkelson, who participated in the two-year-old event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furik for "fourball" and "foursome" matches on Saturday.
Instead of once again being a major figure in the U.S. team, the five-time major-tournament winner spent his day as a fan and in training his long-distance punches in hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the height of his career was never among the straightest players, is not in optimal shape for the Le Golf National's tough pitch, where the long bumpy terrain usually punishes any misfire.
And if the pitch itself isn’t disturbing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and seeking to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the 12 singles games, make a strong start, it may turn out that Mikkelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson would beat Nick Faldo's record for the most games in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could end his Ryder Cup career, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits for the team that are not measured in numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for any team,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big lead may soon be lost.
The captain of the Europa team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the large lead gained before the last day's singles matches at the Ryder Cup can be easily wiped out.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game when the team with captain Seve Balisteros led by five points to the Americans, but right on the final straight was almost caught up and barely managed to hold the win by 141–2-131–2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we also had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very hard," Bjorn said after the 2018 Europa team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading 10-6 at Le Golf:
So history has to show both me and everyone on the team that it’s not all over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
Nothing is over until you see the end result on the dashboard.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I kept saying I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never hurry with the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come to the fore, and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out on your own, that’s when you put your entire capacity as a golfer to the test.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you have to give your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he has to give himself to the end.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furrick will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with exceptions being only Jordan Speet and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these big reverses on the last day - he was part of the triumph of "Brookline", and then was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start you saw at Brookline as you did at Medinah.
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous pressure.
So we formed our squad and distributed our guys the way we wanted to, to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter would meet the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I chose these players in that order because I think it gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postpones launch of new warship
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace obsolete Cold War-era warships, but it won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the brand's flagship new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the latest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to ports of habitation.
Continuous delays, however, mean that advanced warships - rumored to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas - will be old by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of substantial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be manned by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the original 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions."
The official said the problem had become bigger over time as the old ships were decommissioned, but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at a mansion in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting.
Hopes are that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow common bats as well as brown arrow-eared water moths at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations at the estate to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the call sounds of bats, as well as which species issue them.
A habitat map and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. creating meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft, and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first in Scotland and the only special reserve for bats in the Threeve estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manor's manager, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve, we have great terrain for bats," he noted.
“We have old buildings, many old trees, and a suitable habitat completed.
But there's a lot more to bats that aren't known, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible the unintentional destruction of one asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as to destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don't know what's going on with their populations."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portugal-Juventus striker was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video, referring to his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the post as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in this case he simply succumbed to "the one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified by revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is willing to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing carmakers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a border delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to fill its inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's "chesswork" plan for a future relationship with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Following claims from not only Toyota but other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we need to be able to continue to deliver successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term, it warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: "I judge from my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues his fight, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, and thus endangers Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, as testified by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date yet, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed to next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host of the show, asked the reason.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not due to dislike for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he shared, "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We checked these statistics.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you've seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace press conferences once you have a chance to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times bizarre behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
Health minister addresses EU workers at Scotland's National Health Service over Brexit fears
The health minister addressed EU staff working at Scotland’s National Health Service in writing to express the country’s appreciation and willingness to remain in place after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left until Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's game when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, the Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He went to the sideline and sort of just passed out there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the locker rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/seriousness of the trauma," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, was for the first season at Tennessee State following his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him that season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with the additional funds to help the homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury expects an increase of more than 120 million pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with the extra income going to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue helping the government to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The add-on - which is an addition to the current stamp duty, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for rental purposes - could amount to up to three percent.
The state treasury expects receipts to rise by up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for first-time buyers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the affluent areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities", due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty reduction to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land, but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix Britain's "controversy with housing".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the offense of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that the "greatest ambition" of his career was to be the head coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has accepted the challenge to revive the club from north-east England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He moved on to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was it,” Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish games at Hampden, which my father and I watched as a child, so I’ve always been drawn to the national team.
“But this opportunity would only open up if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were names such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloah Athletic's former mentor said he had no concerns as a successor to such established names at a similar celebrity club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will be measured by a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
"It will not be easy to get back to the top level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloah avoid relegation to Division Three and turned St Mirren from a relegation team into a Championship winner the following season.
Ross said he now feels more comfortable than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartleypool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was really at a crossroads," he recalls of the time he took Aloah.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
Being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and strain at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, study reveals
The summer heat has increased the revenue of struggling British pubs, but has added to the pressure on restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the statistics showed.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged sunshine and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup, July follows a similar pattern as June, when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The dining pubs also suffered from the sunny weather, but not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales were down 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year can be particularly painful in addition to the constant cost.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food managers and only the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired rest."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret social media profile from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret social media profile they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has revealed.
Study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta pages
News Raises Fears That Sexual Content Is Being Published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "basic" profile they showed to their parents
One in five children - some one in 11 - creates a social media profile that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news raised fears that sexually explicit material was being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "core" profile they showed to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage child who encouraged others to "rape" him.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the 'voice of the athletes' on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilid Doyle was elected to join the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director of the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished athlete, and chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Aleid enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her appeal," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals in total, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility training!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!”
Advertisement for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, divided online reviews
A company producing breast pumps has divided online opinions with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of the expected "world's first wearable silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives nursing mothers to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay, against the background of a song with lyrics including, "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk your girlfriends."
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "extremely entertaining".
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The squeezing made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who strain (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement praising or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they had danced with the discrete pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is collected discreetly in a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they are being squeezed.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and Chief Creative Officer at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the milk-squeezing and all the challenges involved, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children in detention has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family must provide fingerprints, and this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or family members of guardians reside illegally in the country, with a large proportion of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference call rather than in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those found unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that concern was growing at large facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria Urges U.S., French, and Turkish “Occupational Troops” to Immediately Withdraw
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "appropriate action will be taken against them".
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed" of both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria that mainly train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrians, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-ravaged country.
Regarding refugees, Muallem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western countries of inflaming baseless fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're turning into a political issue, which is a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be given in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold allowed for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear timelines" and expressed hope that the military action will be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated because of impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
There are currently no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the Primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show topped the cable television ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, which tells of a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She remembers riding in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked "Why?".
Mrs. Scowell told me that he replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen doesn’t match up with watching at six o’clock a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as the source for his book Fear; Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket (“the stuffing cloth” according to the Washington Post), and the startling Mr. Trump’s gruesome descriptions.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing participants and daily twists (a nudge with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had shut himself down at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investment flows into the most contentious race in early elections for a seat in Congress
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district received a stream of money thanks to the rearrangement of the congressional districts and hence two incumbents for the same seat.
The recently reassigned district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb faced another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represented Pennsylvania's old 12th district, who significantly advocated the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party's main funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated March partial election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, then withdraws
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said earlier this month.
But there were only sanctions against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid to fight drugs, for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been excruciating for the Central American country with its unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, which serves as a follow-up to a similar gathering last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior authorities said they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has now announced that he will attend the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further tough announcements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, with the report currently a significant piece of evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also said to be directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to report to that body just as he prepares to stand up to voters, as well as perhaps to a jury of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler, as long as the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history depends on such crucial moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are facing several such crucial moments.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man holding the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in The Times was inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI is not complete or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most of all, will we vote in the early congressional elections if it will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Shabbat candles at that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, being aware that a victory over the Austrians after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from playing his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal in question, but he believed that for Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game hoping we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall the draw seems to be a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We looked forward to Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened with my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys really have fun, the training is fruitful.
I hope that we will be able to make every effort to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in a Nationwide survey said they had discussed long-term care costs with their husbands.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken the steps to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse or children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you state your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a long-term care financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy of monetary value, to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds - if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles right from the start.
Appoint a health care proxy so that you have a designated confidant to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Consider also the idea of an agent in financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide these details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s also about who the doctors are going to be,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to interrupted communications, aid organizations could not obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach strip on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which administrative region smaller than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly decimated by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong tremors hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence notice, and resisting arrest, according to a state police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-detention building and under an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certainly" when asked about pleading, the media reported.
Palin is threatened with punishment for three Class A misdemeanors, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which was punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being considered by the Court of Veterans Affairs in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, with the number of dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social networks there are videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bike lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused severe bodily harm, according to the notification of intent in connection with the death penalty request filed in the Southern District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end in a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal court sent Saipov a 22-point indictment, including eight racketeering-related murder charges commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberateness", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of doing so as "terrible, cruel and perverse".
"Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Fellucci and Alejandro Damian Panuco," the notice reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York sought capital punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek by nationality, showed no sense of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment alleges.
He also asked for the Islamic State flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty verdict and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the Conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" - as one of Theresa May's own party members suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain “would have left by now” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to deal with the deeply divided ranks of the party has been highlighted by Conservatives supporting staying, who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan Chequers, despite attacks from pro-Brexit, pro-remain and EU supporters.
The allies insist that she will make progress in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bonn told protesters with the slogan "Getting out means getting out" in Solihull that he wanted to "throw away Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr. Farage should have participated on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan.
Stating his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bonn dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is entirely false".
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and really helped to get elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit and we’re here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of this country’s people that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags reading "Conservatives Against Brexit" since the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the party's security application issues when it opened at the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can deploy the IT systems and all of Canada’s technology and more, and more, for seamless border crossing, for border-free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he will "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democratic representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a perennial critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Deal, who was joint chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she may take over as Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was high time "for women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top."
Arrested for LSU's Simms death
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting, when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 AM Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man on the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, having a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without issue and detained in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Community Police Department.
A youngster with a height of 6x6, growing up in Baton Rouge - Simms was involved in 32 games with 10 exits as a starter last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after team guidelines helped him beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team will have an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, thus enabling Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to pit-stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also pit-stopped on the next lap and exited after Vettel, but Hamilton was able to overtake him after a daring maneuver and driving "rubber to tire", which forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to release the inside of the track to avoid a time-added penalty after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defensive maneuver on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
After that, he even led for quite a long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for the fourth position.
He finally entered for a pit-stop on lap 44, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Valtteri did a great job all weekend and showed himself as a true gentleman when he let me outrun him.
The team did an outstanding job to win the top two spots on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaisey Ford, which accuses Supreme Court contender Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally call in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and insincere."
“What can happen is the good that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You know?
Diane Feinstein, did it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document, “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't distribute," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September - but Feinstein denies this spread took place from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Ford’s claims, I didn’t spread her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it private and I kept it as she had asked.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you it was very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court challenger accused of sex crimes against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
“Look at the dishonesty, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch in Dundee 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney tied for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for the boys of Adam Keefe, who got out of the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between the opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The kick with which Dwyer opened the scoring came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance, assisting Beauvilliers four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the help of Cowney at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again tied the odds with a powerful kick in the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this game at the end of the second half, as he gave his all and solidified the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who have lost the last four games of a total of five games, are welcoming as hosts the Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Flight Attendant Killed to Make Sure Hundreds of People on Board Plane Could Escape Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing in a powerful earthquake that hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to hit the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were on the run to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaky control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia's Air Control spokesman, Johannes Sirite, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency said access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached six meters ravaged Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There are looters everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports one person missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not contact a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claimed that the plane had gone very low.
“It’s very good,” says Janes.
Janes said he and others were able to cross deep water to reach the plane’s emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped in the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank into about 30 feet of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered flights over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any cases.
An Analyst Reveals the Chronology of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
Prosecutors closed their case this Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the officers went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood trial on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford stated that "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis stated that she knew Chambers from two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He has erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscientious Hip-Hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has strayed from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common were revived in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black man?
New York nanny sues couple after firing for 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a misspelled message from the mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denied being racist, likening the claim to "blackmail".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“Noooooooooooo, the next black woman,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the previous nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day’s work and then sent home in a taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation due to the dismissal, asking the amount of $350 per day for the six-month arrangement she was originally hired for, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do this," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure it's discrimination."
In response to the lawsuit, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that terminating Morris' employment was the prudent action, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Comparing the claim to "blackmail", Plasco claimed that his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still under review, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denouncing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, told of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's released.
It's a lot of fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he was welcoming the 60th anniversary of the book's publication "with mixed feelings", following his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of the final success.
"He was quite a modest man and he was not a boaster," she said.
“But because Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who’s accomplished something: you’re proud of it, even though it’s not really your doing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
“He kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stopped working and left her system.
She was gone a while before, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all of this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who still mourns the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea of the ordeal she was going through.
“No one understood,” she said.
“I had my head down and my tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this all-consuming sense of empathy with Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Mourning women put up postcards to prevent suicides from bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lidney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile brightened every room.”
However, he had given up his job before leaving, and was in a "truly dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards “to let people know they have someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their presents, he neither looked at them nor anything."
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is in doubt after the FBI launches an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted - an investigation of limited duration and limited scope - perhaps we could join forces," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "collapsed" despite a confirmed over-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is for the moment itself.
The snap election is in just five weeks, on November 6th - if, as expected, Republicans do not perform well, their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the state will seriously suffer.
George W. Bush called Senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare a tie and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees ‘reduced’ by Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong-sug, citing data from the South Korean ministry of reunification, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr Park, tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
The majority of North Koreans eventually obtain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and it is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China regards refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the deadlock in the nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to basically work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Congress Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted that way, they would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected claims that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and getting emotional when discussing his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality" organized by liberals who were unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and with the way he’s prosecuting the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied it when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s unfit not only to go to the Supreme Court, but to the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this great?'" Pelosi said.
Women need to be controlled too.
It's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't take it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, "I got tremendous help from a woman who was an executive somewhere who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but has developed her technique, thanks to which when she gets angry and cries, she tells her interlocutor, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, was how once, while I was whining with inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck - a chilling supervisor I'd always been a little afraid of - and she dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-wedlock relationship on a yacht called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was for another one to come.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she got involved late in the campaign, she fell behind on fundraising and decided that she would not stay in the race if she failed to raise US$2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She realized that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was flooded with so many feelings - gratitude to the people who supported her, resentment against the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and to be able to turn to voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning salvo this year, taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation in tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (150 billion pounds) of production, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with new tariffs of five to ten percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. strike, and soon the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore that.
To get Washington to give up would be to give in to the demands, but to bow down to Washington in public would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of a trade war with the U.S. could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, Asia-related research fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country ravaged by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas ravaged by terrorists in order to restore them to their normal state.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or assistance would be accepted from countries that had financed the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the United States team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has had six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The United States star, Phil Mickelson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, threw his first shot at the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, thus losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed well in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the tournament's history to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in its current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5&4 of the player in the team of Europe, which is at the lowest place in the rankings - Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last Ryder Cup appearance.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup appearances, became the European with the most points earned in the tournament of all time, increasing his assets this year to 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to be able to lift the bowl again.
The most important thing is the team and I am happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said after the win.
He passed the baton to his compatriot John Ramm, who beat American legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 on Sunday's singles.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play,” Ram said.
Woods lost all his four games in France and his total Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles - an indicator by which he inferior only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
Team U.S. captain Jim Furrick shared after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pressed the Europa team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We'll regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers' Association and our Raider Cup Committee, and we'll only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can’t take off your opponent’s hat.
We were just outplayed."
