It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old man.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I feel like walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He is a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not using Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a pass.
How much is it worth?
We had our fill of water.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He probably still has it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o’clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've been watching.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine, give it back.
Wolves stalked the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father so he tries to make amends.
Tom can't fake it.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom a little blush in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered yes.
I owe it to him to help.
He is being criticized.
You'll know when the time is right.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be impertinent with me.
I think you made it.
We didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever considered quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it, if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
Nobody's judging you.
Stop making Tom look bad.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes eggnog.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinds the film.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Are they buying these?
Doesn't look too good.
Hey, can I have that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take your hat off.
Acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke in French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
I run my nose every time I get a cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's surface is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in such a way that you'll understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still had the price tag on it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There has to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient and even submissive.
Where did Tom go?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't make a man out of mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I like burps.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You haven't seen one of those, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes transmit malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't understand.
That's unfortunate.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry.
I think I know how to find him.
We also accept checks.
Vesnikov costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
Macedonian has four verb modes: pronounced, conditional, command, and repronounced.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are accurate.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We are the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Aren't we supposed to help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember how I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom was furious.
What will Japan’s economy look like next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How can you not sleep?
They give me advice.
Tom began to scream.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
The yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom drove me to my motherfucking bed.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite baton.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a tralalajka.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
The girl saw it too.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complains about is the food.
Make sure you don't get dirty in the muddy pond.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna is here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a rusty room.
No survivors.
She should have kept quiet.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I slapped him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who is the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom did not answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This'll cheer you up.
The king was particularly distressed to give speeches, because of the heavy speech defect.
She did not accept the invitation.

The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then to escape.
I licked it.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting one famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem too busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me scream?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back.
Remove the clamp.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Didn't you want the prize?
Watch the dimon.
I'm glad you're glad.
Dishonestly.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to value your health when you get sick.
Look at that shining star.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
We're broke.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just give me a little help?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When should you renew your passport?
Mary does not have the courage to confront Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.

Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the canopy.
Let's forget it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're a fast data receiver.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first I couldn't stand it.
He's got his sleeve on.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone was gone except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I've offended you, haven't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They crouched next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm willing to do that.
The water reached my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia liked the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where should I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom drank from a bottle of wine.
I fell off a bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Does it bother you?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks fell apart.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Wasn't Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you tricked her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did he ask for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran down the bottom.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard's really hot.

You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She's almost got to go.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
He's been blocked.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What is that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom seriously needs help.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his arms.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that the previous dentist told him that he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.

Who will be there?

Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.

Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning over in his grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly and fail to see that their own behavior is undesirable as well.
Wear high heels to make it higher.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I like to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't shout.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up on the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How stubborn you are.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used indecent expressions.
The coffee gives you energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big deal for football.

We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom writes skilfully.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They've got to fight the idea.
Tom is really annoyed.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible that Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
That's exactly what Tom wanted to meet me.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom's richer than we thought.
I never intended to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I have no such desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
Hardwings, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's start a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scratched his knee.
Where do pine nuts come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom stepped up, and the crowd clapped.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work out.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the tipon.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking turkey with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking bowed.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling considerably better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Drop the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm hardened.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He always flaunts his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
Not a single part of the pig failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very useful.
Tom had his phone vibrated.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
Room's full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open it head-on.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought it over.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a high priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
Get it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your pretty eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're up for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems jolly.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had nausea and is suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know how to do.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed it.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a prodigal dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst type of hangover is emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom had his eyes lit up when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved that mystery yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue. It's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before they are a year old, so they are eaten by humans.
Could you pull this arrow out of my leg?
I had forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
Spending money doesn't require water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times, you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously making very bad noises. I hear him chewing gum in the next room!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's go for a walk in the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.
The angels are watching over us and guiding us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy did not help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was available.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is Java.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That did the job.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is sleeping soundly.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There's more than one way out.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found the time to write that report.
I can do without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She got dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love walking along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you know how to snuggle?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
How about a sandwich?
I know what to study.
Surrender the assemblers.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was stained with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
We'll be eating cherries from Italy this afternoon.
And Tom's from Boston.
Watch out, that's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need some sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Evening suits me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The cheramides that fell from the roof broke apart.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom wasn't ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You better go.
Tom knocked the exit out.
I have two cameras.
What'd you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't fight with me.
You seem to have a hard time understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm of no use to you here.
Is anyone hurt?
Tom and I are in love.
It's really weird.
I got paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amoebas are proto-animals.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't necessarily mean Tom's dead.
The waves are generated by the wind.
Get a clean cup out of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French spells its word for "bubamara".
The crane can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Are you good at that?
We're pretty good.
The pork is diced and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love traveling.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was seemingly trying to convince Mary to do something about it.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You have a conscience, don't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know how Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Grab a handkerchief, your nose is running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We've pitched a tent.
I didn't think it would rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Let's just stay.
She has ten children.
Tom warned me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did this happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing pajamas and a bathrobe when I came in this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
In the middle of the city is a fountain.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the way.
Don't interrupt, Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
Mathematics is the best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find it?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can get it from her.
Get some food.
It might be difficult.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think you've been lied to.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
It forces us to work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the bridegroom at every wedding and at every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom was not surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climatic conditions are not inherent in the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should I take this medication?
I don't need a bed.
Put us like on Facebook!
Did you get us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are really happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to repaint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We depend on work.
This box is made of tin.
She failed the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.

Just try it.
I want to dance, too.

Is Tom interested?
It's right here.
I'd like to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work outdoors if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's valuables.
That cake is calorie-dense.

Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm blaming Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What’s not dark?
It's not just a pen.
The water was boiling.
Where's the phone?
They will pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not bluer.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of the day.
Is this where we wait?
If you come out naked like that, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everyone busy?
They don’t want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got hurt.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom did not resist.
We did a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Hand me the wine.
All shops are closed.
You've been making whites again!
Stop patting your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We unnecessarily dramatize.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go myself.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom get along with his co-workers?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you a little advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I already forgave you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
What's the shortcut for?
Thanks again for coming.
They're deceiving us.

Can I touch you?
Are you missing something?
>>srp_Cyrl<< To sit a man to cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked among the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom acted like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you guys fight.
I should have been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was pouring his bowels.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is don't give Tom any presents.
Tom was a hard worker.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.

She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.

I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the downhill.
Should I make something up?
I need to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's have a look.
Europeans like to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He has a lot of debt.
They know the major cities.
What's under the covers?
No one wants to play with it.
Tom to everyone's drinking tours.
You ready to go?
Tom's obviously gone mad.
Tom approached them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her prowess.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk anyway.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
My job hurts.
The question is who will do it.
I'll leave for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, just ask me anything.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He's walking to school.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you won't help.
Tom seems very conceited.
Now the question is what should we do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished in fourth place out of 56 runners.
Don't shout.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom exasperated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Knit a wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
You'll never get into that club.

Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We should help them.
These are very immature.
Tom did not respond immediately.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We exaggerate.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he's had a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, well, he'll get better... when the willows give birth to grapes.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when is there fireworks?
It's possible that Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants what you want.
I didn't betray anything.
I just thought of you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one has found an answer to, including myself, despite thirty years of research into the female soul, is “What do women want?”

The villagers are reaping.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the breach?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
Every time we part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
They're all up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my good luck!
The concert ended with the National Anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Hold on a second.
I've got work to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Any nuances are lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's enough air in here.
She married zero of a man.
The wind stopped.
Nothing's changed.

I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The Sun is a star among billions of others.
I caught measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm doing.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
The one who can hear the butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not for eating like commodities!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be a lot more afraid.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I've just finished my hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is to our right.
Tom's not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he'd saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw it.
Tom's a little limp.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How is the cylinder volume located?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's had a drink.
I enjoyed your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the socket.
Will I be replaced?
I should get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a type of mammal.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I completely understand.
Tom looks shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, what about you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
You took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not so young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles is it from here to Boston?
I'm good for it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get even colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is understated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead.
We've never done this before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been well for two days.
It's too easy to bend.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know what the difference is between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Rainfall does not come into consideration.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got asalen.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
Haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing a rotten egg at Mary.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
And who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was immediately worried.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already do.
He wrote a letter to his mother.
They differ.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for him to swim across the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We were barely saved.
Did they hire you?
It's leaking gas.
Tom could see Mary was texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little dazed.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Dude, you can't just walk up to a woman and poke her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We rolled up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
You blew a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It is better to be an optimist and a fool than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Considering what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave it at that.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose your temper.
He's got false eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not the shy guy he used to be.
Get it?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played jamming, some tile, some with a ball. Others rode a bicycle or rode wooden horses.
Doubt destroys friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not much more milk in the bottle.
We should both go.
The pain that love causes is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's good of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come on.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from within.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He banged his head.
We're behind.
Get the seat back.
What's it for?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is furious.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It’s hard to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't tell which one the baby wants, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom had a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom was struggling.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for it.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're on?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a stiletto on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What is your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that what Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail eventually.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you've made a list of things to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you resist?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is it there?
Oh, God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had inflammation of the lungs, I just stared at my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard right.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, yeah, no.
There's nobody here.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You did your best.
He's a glutton.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom buys me a toy.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you said you would give them.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What's settled?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never cut you off.
He made it look easy.
Better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dry.
I thought I'd get them some help.
Maybe it would be best if you called them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts.
We were 18 years old.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Keep it up.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom was starting to get upset.
I think you should pick her.
Behave yourself.
You're great.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've been a lot worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
Just one drink.
Nobody's texting me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling to hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What did you do last?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
It haunts us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties very often.
He doesn't look like his father at all.
Tom's not exactly hardened.
It was after midnight.
It's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, at least expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take off your coat.
I don't think I've been followed.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You are entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get stoned.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the forms.
I don't imagine a party like that, but as you wish.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom smeared his toast with butter.
We've got work to do.
I heard him sniff.
Should we call Tom?
Tom followed you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the Ridon.
I'll accept whatever it is.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
Soon it will be Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to such problems.
You'll be fine.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's stoned.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the victors are always right, and the vanquished are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if it can be said at all to be possible.
It's been an arduous day.
I've got some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome weakness.
How many push-ups do you do a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Did you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was dripping with alcohol.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't make me come get you, Tom.
He won first place in the match.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She was late yesterday.
You're debauched.
Everybody kept quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.What's wrong?
He gave up on the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It might seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
That's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that all we need?
He was worried about his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has an earache.
Dan was hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get a response from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on your mind, Tom?
A mother's advice would exceed a friend's.
We haven’t escaped the danger yet.
Tom's freaking out.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've done it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom's seen worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to cook pasta.
The hunter went deep into the forest and never returned.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming, I'm getting sick of my head.
You ain't giving me no orders, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get fed up.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'll get stronger.
This elephant is adored by little children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on lipstick.
She has a picture.
She's a good swimmer.
The flowers wilt.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is really annoying.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We need more American slang on Tatoeba, under Urgent!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I like tea.
I wouldn't want to intrude under any circumstances.
Does no one want to sit with you?
It would be really nice to keep quiet.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a traveler.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the melody of a trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all the art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom is a fool.
I think Tom will be here on time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Make sure the gas is turned off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the pantry.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human companionship.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so violently that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, quite by accident.
Did Tom talk to you?
It's hard to understand self-harm if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's evening.
Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can myrtle be used in dishes?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom's very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without anyone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Get Tom's weapon.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
A lot of studios.
Tom played the piano for three hours straight.
I got a quality one.
Did you find someone to look after the child?
I'm quiet.
He was after the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom squealed out loud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not saying anything.
That'd be good.
It's a quick walk.
Tom is very stingy.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.
I'm gay.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man's wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom has for me.
I've seen him in person.
I love all my children equally.
I won't do what you ask.
Tom seems pissed off.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where there are none.
My sister does her hair in the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Rainwater evaporates when it is warm.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom's probably still in school.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
You're beneath him.
It's my job to be early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom will hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How much of your body is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me welcome Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Do not stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
What are you so dressed up for?
I mean, I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom is sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody did anything else.
Sorry to barge in like this.
Books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom made a good point.
They must be worried.
I gave him a lift.
That gave me an idea.
The clock feder broke.
I asked around about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Let's all get me.
This is a good parking spot.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not really old.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm getting a little nauseous.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's sled.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does it collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There could be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear is green.
Tom regretted what he had told Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom frowned.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like to walk.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just about to get started.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Go on!
And if he refuses, Tom?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's deposition.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone acquires his own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm blaming him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I skipped class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, I'll have a hard time catching fish.
Tom was napping.
I think she's good at dancing.
The system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs both help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom looks confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little bit more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a harsh critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball at the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear the air.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call.
You don't get this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom yelled.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom licked it.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family begins where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran outside half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom to Mary was sitting.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a spinner.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I was done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is uneventful.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I slashed the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You are my happiness.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left uneaten food on the plate.
Tom changed direction.
There is no living person in the classroom.
The missile's flying.
We laughed.
Tom was a little on edge.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where to begin?
I know you're a spy.
Have a good trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom made sure she looked busy, so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'll go ask her.
I've got his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers quickly wilt after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
Our money's been spent.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
He and I are friends.
I may admire others, but I've never lambasted to be anything other than who I am.
Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't heat me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Sometimes children are afraid of the dark.
Stay back.
I had to stay.
Tom is the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom is sad.
Kubev's hair.
This is the best restaurant in the area.
That's the one I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them puking.
Too bad I didn't ride my bike here.
I have to go see Tom.
What's making you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothing.
This is classified.
That's not that many.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to overshadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give us a chance.
He suddenly appeared.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's a used car dealer.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too numerous.
Who was the thief?
He has charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tapes doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would get messy.
I didn't know whether to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We waited.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether he will visit us next month.
Marionettes are run by wires.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls teased her about her clothes.
You'll get confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure has smothered him.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Even she doesn't understand me.
Beekeepers believe genetically modified plants are harming bees' health.
You can go now.
They're stalling.
Tom's a sophomore.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
The tourists were not satisfied.
Tom took off his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like cobwebs - they hunt flies, but let wasps and hornets break through.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, as was his habit.
He took off his fur jacket downstairs, climbed up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing on this one, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
There was something wrong with Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're full.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait at the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long has Tom been here?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to say it?
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is a very beautiful city.
This handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Glad for dear."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one is defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We have a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is staggering.
Let me breathe.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet? Never mind! I just found it under the couch.
He's watching TV now.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can chain me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
Happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try on this sweater.
The cat thrust its claws into my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What were you doing up so late?" "I was on the phone with my ex."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're upsetting me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom is not as naive as many people think.
I punched him in the jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going on a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Does that word even exist?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone turned Tom down.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old coins.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you said.
We have to face the facts.
No damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom sleeps on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What do I have to choose from?
We've got to get them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving, so he caused an accident.
I brought a few bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why is Tom doing this?
I have an assignment for you.
How is a plural of nouns formed?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
It's very rare.
He gave me a nasty cold.
It got better.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't get mad at us.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're really good at this.
It was a sneaky trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for espionage.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom aren't too disappointed.
These little letters can only be read with a magnifying glass.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I won't hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He would do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say anything you don't mean.
You have a beautiful room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Let Tom make his boss.
Our chun was approaching the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute, my laundry's done, I'm gonna go give it to him.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
I wish I had the strength to go on a diet.

That's all they talk about.
A guy grabbed my purse while he was riding his bike.
When was the last time you breastfed your baby?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look too good.
I'm hunchback.
They're gonna fire me because I'm so late for work.
I thought it might be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's it!
There's always a catch.
Your health is very important to me, why don't you go to the doctor?
Spirit, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Is the freezer still running?
The city restored that old, historic edifice.
I can't ask him to.
He's really ugly.
Tom came back covered in mud.
It's not for you.
Tom wondered if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom is at the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with children.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom baked me a cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like being touched.

Tom's gone on a bike.
He returned at six o'clock.
It has been shown that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
Be careful when climbing the ladder.
Was he with anyone?

Tom was wrong.
Take your paws off me.
Don't say that name around me.
Are you gonna throw that away?
Tom's got a good job.
Those are my things.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We're gonna deal with this.
It feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'm gonna reread this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a disastrous failure.
He just got back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop pestering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you come to Boston?
Something bit me.
Mushrooms contain significant amounts of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back at work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.

There's a girl missing.
Tom despises your impertinence.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of places he wanted to visit.
From his eyes, I knew he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me a red and white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
Shot three times.
I would complain if I wanted to.
They're gratis.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in the choir.
I don't have another word to say.

Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see him.
Tom was only partially joking.
I'm gonna find out who did this.

Is Tom dead?
You're not rattling me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Try to lean in.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
They crouched next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't puke now.
Has anyone seen Tom?
I could use some help with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
It was an amazing evening.
Smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.

She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very sharp tip.
Get ready.
Put it down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch you on fire if you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
You're in charge now.
Not all of them sleep.
Did they all agree?
These are my pencils.
Aren't you going to leave?
Do you know anyone who might be able to help?
This week is extremely warm.
No one wanted to get up from the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?

What brand of shampoo do you use?
He's good for playing cards.

What were they doing?
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
As far as I can see, there's nothing medically wrong with Tom.
I've seen him play cards with all of them.
Tom's acting confidential.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a tail?

I must have forgotten.
Tom talked Mary into going to the party with him.
Tom can do almost anything.
We arrested him.
What else could you have done?

He talks a lot.
I'm not normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order a pizza?
The worse, the better.

How's it going, Tom?
The wind changed direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you came?
I can't get an ass answer from Tom.
Let's just say I found out about this earlier.
Is something missing?
I didn't do it for him.

I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not some big sailor.
My dad got a blackout on the white droplets last month.
What a sad story!
Make sure you get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'm gonna live much longer.
You should help her.
They're worried about him.
Tom was unaware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I have no friends.
Tom plays in a band and is very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom's interest faded.
Let's play volleyball.
Yesterday was fun.
Tom might be able to help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating at restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay.

Call it what you will.
I'll have Tom take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Sure!
They're not happy.
They were verbally abused.
Why were you chasing me?
I've been busy enough.
I couldn't do what you do.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard the noise.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who possesses it.

I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up the thought of going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom is effective.
I should be alone.
I can get it from them.
I read Tom a story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take him with me.
It has nothing to do with luck.
I think you know the rules.
I sincerely regret it.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at six.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll arrange for you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The dragon saw her.
I have to turn my phone off.
The weather's good.
That was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom did it with ease.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a cherry tree outside my house.
He is the boss of the company.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.

It won't get any better.
He's already done his job.
My ears are closed.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's get creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to put too much effort into it.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at two-and-a-half.
How would Tom know?
She goes to school for the deaf.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very certain.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I took so long.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I turned Tom down.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in a bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and that's it!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let’s do our best.
I'll pay.
It's entirely possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes ahead of you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
To be envious is a sin.
All children are strangers.
I got shot.
Tom is not prone to drama.
I completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't walk away to look at us through the keyhole.
This tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That pillar's not exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to speak French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going, period.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They're being chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no life in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you very much anyway.
You're a good cook.
There is no shortcut to the top, only to failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
You could tell you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automatic cars are now widespread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's carrying chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new coin.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who took my snack?
The organist was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
His aunt eats an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I've shown you?
I'm making scrambled eggs.
I like the color blue.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take bribes.
Don't sugarcoat my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be made.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can you teach me to play the bagpipe?
She was well chosen.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure spending the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a wastelander.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He undressed to take a bath.
A river of sweat started pouring down my face.
Mary renounced moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just roll with it.
I want to learn math.
Pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you two hook up?
The movies are a great distraction.
At first I didn’t see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody was smiling.
I didn't ask your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The cork doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to keep an eye on Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee and Tom likes to drink hot coffee.
I gave her a fake address.
I took a bath.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom giggled.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
Why would I need a lawyer?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really going to try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's he buying Tom?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take off your clothes.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
I need to fasten my seat belt.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom?
Who won the award?
Please be on time.
Germans have a softer attitude to nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women love men with moustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a thunderbolt.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I was unlucky.
His body was overgrown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I've really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I meant to tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most prominent American songwriters.
It can't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't disturb Tom.
Tom wishes he'd never come back here.
Nobody likes a crybaby.
Crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would if I could.
Tom's really fucked up.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We arrived first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate very nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He was used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling in Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Can he do anything he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom still doesn't know what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
Looks like you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come save you.
I've got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was chestnut brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's the point?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I got some donuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We have to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is made up mostly of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love men with moustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I care about them.
People are dying all the time.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He drew his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little down in the morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom got kicked by a mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this topic with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is abhorrent.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back.
Marco thinks he writes skilfully.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I took the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very tidy.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
What a scoundrel you are!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to give in.
Tom's been suspended.
They were hooking up.
She's going to be a teacher.
I don't intend to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrified.
Tom looks spoiled.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll get help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're stalling.
He's been working at the embassy since three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
We might have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom gets mad.
It's from work.
We'll manage.
Praise encourages students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself on a scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At the time, the title "lady" was only used for nobles.
Tom has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Do you believe that?
How do you choose just one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
I'm actually here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I get paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear the laughter of children.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us to it.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Don't mix work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unsealed.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he stopped, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was riding in the back seat.
The bank loaned $1 million to the company.
I have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he couldn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just go inside.
He drew a sword out of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've made my point.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom found something interesting.
They had more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did you want Tom to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan gets mad.
I don't even know which is which.
I don't call them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What is their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It is about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It was doing a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
A blood vessel burst in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
You overdid it!
He has a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What flavor do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch that the play will be canceled; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom feels he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
My goal is to read books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have lots of kids.
Tom seems like a jerk.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What do you see here?
I get the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live, in some part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's an expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in this orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd water the litter.
Do you know how that could happen?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please do not add comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what he was wearing when I met you?
Lightnings are usually accompanied by thunderbolts.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom knocked him to the ground.
The lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to hook up with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called her psychiatrist.
How come you're not sleeping yet?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen it.
That would be uncultured.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I've made a good point.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this overwhelming?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm dating my ex-boyfriend again.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head reminds me of Maria.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would fight back.
She's always working hard.
Which country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took great care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
You can't stand the heat.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't allow that.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken coin.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not how I wanted it.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this assignment.
Looks like we're gonna have to do better than that.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them right now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing it together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling out to John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits too long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
The forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with destiny.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know compassion.
There's some more tea in the kettle.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise annoyed me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto any time soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom disguised himself as a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is he such a Tom?
I'm having sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you so.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto belongs to no one.
She handles a saw skilfully.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
He's hatched the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very nice.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week or so.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
I love spin-pop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get a hold of Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was smeared with semen.
Tom's fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thanks.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you've won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything from you.
Tom aspires to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people in the house?
Tom should go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're acting childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what's started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
A nail punctured the tire.
We've made ourselves trees.
This is much better.
I'll get her to cut your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're Brooke.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know what it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They stormed the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You only think she's weird because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It's not working yet.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he sincere?
The dish was empty.
Don't say it.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't budge.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire lived in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I did my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in jeopardy.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came over this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Lightning struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
My salary was raised again.
I'll never go there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom did all this.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is lukewarm.
There was no plant life in this area.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom’s response?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I had to do.
Tom's a long way away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained to do that.
She has tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound released pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you look for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary the papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
These two seem to be in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is the moral choice of the translator whether to translate something or not. Some things are better left in the language that produced them.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd get him some help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's kindness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
There was a large crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked deep into Mary’s eyes and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Oh, really?
I can touch the floor with my palms without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You should have found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be notified in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You should not write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend it.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive personality.
Maybe someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powdered medicine.
We walked along the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom reacted badly.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her great-granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
I smell flowers.
Tom nodded.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust my teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started squirting.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in great difficulty.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're qualified for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems undecided.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer's dead.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
Our consciences make us all cowards.
No need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You're wrong.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee injury is now festering.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
None of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to enjoy it.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
How long has Tom been asleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered heavy losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like some menthol candy?
Why would Tom do this to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
This is where I'm coming down.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel ruptured in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy man to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a nutmeg.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children were drawing pictures on the chalk pavement.
You're wondering what took you so long.
Did you get a response from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to realize what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the magnificent lustres that are in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have on your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I've heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's pretty common, actually.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom reckoned with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary unscrewed the lipstick.
Hey, guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
The moon is coming back.
Tom is wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's morning.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down the wall!
Tom looks stunned.
Tom stepped up.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I'm not happy with my retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's going to fight much.
What are you grinning about?
I'll call him right away.
It's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get a response from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Were you watching?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the proverbs?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take your hat off.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in the ass.
What did Tom find?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's mad as hell.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's keep the peace!
Tom is well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satiate my thirst.
Tom arrived just in time.
Television is boring.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say goodbye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
That sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks that fly from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept Mary quiet all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
The kids love cake.
He was quite restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still love the horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted that he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom began to whine.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
It's all with us.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They ignore me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His girlfriend weakened.
It's over between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom is always there.
He left me in despair.
Tom screamed and woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has poor eyesight.
The flash wasn't working, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start immediately.
Is it ready?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not overjoyed that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put an apron on.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
I already wrote everything that needed to be written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe it was Tom who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We could not see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this one?
I want you to come back here.
Tom wants you to do it, so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're so insolent.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back on his feet.
That's how you need it.
I fell in love with you.
We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom got a new job.
Tom won't be back until dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I overeat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see a thing.
He's quite an unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and pinned another one on the spot.
Halt!
Would you like some cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The cows are not in any way clear.
That was very negligent of Tom.
It's busted.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Have them cut your hair.
Axing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They will pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We weren't fighting.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time you are both heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's say for now you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't know.
Tom is an invertebrate.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
First we have to find them.
I'm keeping score.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a frying pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always get those two names mixed up.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a habitat.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusher-written.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom wasn't crying.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the knob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is sadder than stupidity and indifference.
They're all having fun.
Tom didn't protest.
What are websites made of?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She is a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day shoveling snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is Boston?
I'm getting paid to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on a train while he was walking to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that was hung on the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I feel sleepy.
It has not been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What do you got?
This is a product for men.
We looked everywhere.
I like your website very much.
I'll get you.
Push this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What really bothers her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom ditched his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's being cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
Bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees have collapsed.
Lions don't know colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm shorter than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman sat between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I've got pus in my right ear.
Boxes of cardboard are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Hanging the calendar on a wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you before.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
We were cursed.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn him around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
Turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very soundly.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
You're weakening something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from the attic.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom shined his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom loaned me some money.
Am I disturbing you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hang in there, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm out of here.
He was speeding.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had one daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sucking up to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom shaved his face.
What's in it for me?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when she wears that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this one.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but I didn't button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dolphins are a species on mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom makes fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go eat out.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to babysit.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third time lucky.
We should tear it up.
This airy dough is popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and give up vices.
You're bright.
I'm against this project.
Aren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I got here too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inopportune time.
This dog is staring at me like he's trying to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What was Tom thinking?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies eventually.
I know how to stay calm.
I love the beauty.
I think about it all day.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
The building is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying above the clouds.
I like it a lot!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like big ones.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom sat alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
It's a ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom backed off.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherry trees are wormy.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You've made Tom miserable.
Warm him up.
Tom looked annoyed.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
No hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't even think about it.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test. And you?" "Same."
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was talkative.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
I've had enough.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't feel good when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do anything.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
Titles should attract the attention of readers.
He was sitting right in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French film with an English translation.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Tom's full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a tumultuous relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have the violin?
Call us.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at a wedding.
Which one would Tom choose?
The hospital isn't that big.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not petting their dog.
I didn't sleep right.
I don't want to, and I can't, serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
It's gone.
Tell Tom he mustn't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will lighten up soon.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was dressed.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day of school.
Don't sneak up on me when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You burn the car.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Half of the species marry.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
That's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do socially useful work to make up for everything I've done.
Tom tied his strings.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in a number of different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the wasps poisonous?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're wrong, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary gave a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who will pay the rent?
You're being a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom's not interested.
Tom wanted Mary to drive John to a library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows etiquette.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have a menu?
It’s not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom's lost his mind.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight's weak.
That's my specialty.
I try not to worry about you.
I had prepared a speech.
Hawks have sharp eyesight.
I wrote them that.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom honked.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom laughed politely.
Teacon's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off the weight.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano is active again.
Tom told me he had things to take care of.
How's that gonna help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The small island looks like a turtle from afar.
Do they bite the trout?
What did you ask Tom?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop blanching.
I'm thirty.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go to a movie.
Beautiful women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He tripped him.
Mary felt her face warm.
I know what upsets Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom's needlessly picking up a jive.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
>>srp_Cyrl<< It hurts terribly here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he'd left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kinder to each other.
Tom's expendable.
I think I'd better help him.
You're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's grinning at him.
Faith means to hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom kept me company.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're ruining your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The snort is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the brim.
Pick a weapon.
They elected a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one dragging himself in the back.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They were asked to raise their salary.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom would be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I'd have wanted to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
How about I see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's entirely possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It works like a greaseball.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
Today was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father has the flu.
I don't wait very long.
Just look at you.
This is awesome.
Missing blank in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers shot.
Tom can't stand it.
The store's closed.
They listened.
Tom came out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom is enraged.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They disassembled it.
Tom's a big sissy.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I inquired about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He's squirming like an eel.
You should pay your rent up front.
Put all the trash in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's that time again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do it.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go round up Tom and come back.
I don't see any conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off the mask.
That's one option anyway.
You can go anywhere.
I'm embarrassing myself.
I liked the way you danced.
I need some.
They tricked us.
Tom's the one.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've disfigured him.
It's a white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
My shoelaces are tickling.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I screwed up.
You've healed me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice has melted.
I shed blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must be so relieved.
They never caught me.
I love my homeland.
I haven't learned how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't jinx me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They look at themselves in the mirror.
I don't feel like crying.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom escorted Marie to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two have fought me!
I've never worn a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I study music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won't be worth the wait.
I have to buy a new rug for the room.
Tell Tom to text me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's also cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have been there since day one.
Let's make out.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's what Tom did.
"Aren't you going to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it after."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off the weight.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are genuine leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather strap on her waist.
They were putting out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I'll go look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't want to use dildos - I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You're only allowed to stay quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I already told you everything?
Don't fight it.
I expect help from you.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only had A's at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
He was great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The dentist installed a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me this card.
We will discuss the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat an apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My father gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom cut my hair.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's appropriate to wipe it off with an elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you like to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really turns me on.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is self-inflicted.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom's calmed down.
The glove has a hole in its thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's how I suspected.
Tom doesn't do what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your soulmate.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do then?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in jail.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
I'm gonna go first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
He became a chukunbaba just a few days before he turned ninety-nine.
Have you looked everywhere?
It’s important to remember that no one is ever 100%.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends anyone money.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, due to his age and frail health, he was allowed to serve that sentence under house arrest.
Scientists say that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her often.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom mowed down the tree.
The earth is still watery, the sword will most likely give up.
He was taking a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She aspires to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little redder.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We have to help her.
Tom stood there and kept quiet.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a pigsty.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Foucher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are mild.
It doesn't matter.
I like comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
Legumes fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How fast do you get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you going to dress up this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's jammed.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I thirst for him.
He's laying out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're pushing me too hard.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you take a break?
You haven't asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky's brightened.
The crowd will wake the baby.
Just look straight ahead.
That's not really something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play a draw.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd prefer the son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary to her.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked until two o'clock.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on a roll.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a donut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it's done, but Tom asked me not to.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Did you study outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in your diary today?
I just wish this would never happen again.
Can he do it himself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peek through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand him.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you curving?
Come on, Tom.
I'll do my best to get there in time.
Nobody came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're pretty much ready.
Tom has a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not pleasant to him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him open the table.
I had potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could have found someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom's drunk.
I slept in the chun.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That might actually work.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
Fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's too bad.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
You got me all over your head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems distracted.
Have fun prolonging your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can make it here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
Demek, should I know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
No way I'm guessing.
She runs slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture, you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just cleared Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You should hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He got ahead of them.
Here, brother, in half.
Tom sent a new mushmah he had just bought to the table.
Tom's going to help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed.
The landscape is gorgeous.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to restrain myself.
Autumn has arrived.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What is the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Supeva's too salty.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom continued to practice.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom peeked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It looks familiar.
I am envious.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a shrewd man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but she's not gonna fool me!
Let's just get foggy.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm getting sick.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a shopkeeper.
It is simple to solve this task.
They must have removed the bullet that had stuck to his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how that probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshade.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to get stung by a catfish.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
Wipers don't help against ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Doesn't seem to be a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorific?
They'll get it soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the turnip.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I like to make faces at him.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
Several reasons come to mind.
Tom became a dad.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all underwhelming.
I still think of her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Are you still unable to write your name?
Tom put the diary in a drawer.
Give him a chance.
It's on me.
How many more days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom has a collection of babushkas.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
You got enough?
Mice are carriers of plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom nodded.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving, so he caused an accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
It's okay.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak very good French.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, not German.
It's gonna take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I've been disqualified.
Have you finished packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The President announced that the United States would launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom helped me out a little.
Am I here too soon?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom's not listening to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom wandered off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
This is an undeniable fact.
Is it good?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom frowned a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave himself up to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd get it.
Rats are a type of mammal.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
Maybe I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went on to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like puzzles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is located in a valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, lighten the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I'm making my honey toast.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making cake.
Look at the counter.
I was impressed with your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Shut it all down.
Tom's choking.
They think we're a gang.
I just watch TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I am with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything at all.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a lovely bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Hang on a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is fast-talking.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might get along.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were totally confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he had to make amends.
It's a message to them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He threw a stone at the dog.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
I wrote this book myself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be conceited.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to plow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmud can't stand to lose.
Nobody listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Loire.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little further.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
It would be my pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul desires.
Take me for a raccoon.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He is very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember he was in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs should I make a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's turned into a pie maker.
You have very penetrating eyes.
Isn't that implied?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I write pretty well.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Take a smoke and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems dependable.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom's not sociable.
However, the quantity is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four corners.
I continued to work.
They develop dependency.
Would you like me to go with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and remained silent.
Get a shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary took after her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
The Mass is over.
Tom wiped the blade of the knife off his jeans.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just have her call me back, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gave me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me through his glasses.
Linda convinced Dan he was stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not get in the way of Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Is Tom hurt?
Who broke the aquarium?
I've had it with you.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Shall I take your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is wild.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a tow truck.
I like to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk face-to-face.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the exam results?
If you want quality, pay up.
Tom was gnawing at something.
She studied English.
With such a lush dream, you will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll get through this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit out the chewing gum.
Have it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended it?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer to that?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked strong.
Buy what?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy talked about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn out the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back yet?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What the hell, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer is careful.
Tom often runs away from classes.
Now it's time for compensation.
Most virgins have a reading hymen.
You can come out on top.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited for a long time in the rain.
You'll manage.
Does that dog have it?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get hold of something like this.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really does.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria did not understand the lecture. The orator should have spoken more slowly.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That drug calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother is American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It's moldy bread, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked annoyed.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to your boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works well.
Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I'd rather have goat cheese than cow cheese.
We get that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Carpenters cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini, finish.
Single couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear out the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I'm out of money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
You stood me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
Brought in after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light went on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
Now we need it.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood flows through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
I have a sore thumb on my right leg.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where do we come from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom sings for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.

I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.

It's obviously a typo.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
Will the police come?
First we have to find him.

There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.

You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.

It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened immediately.

You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's resourceful.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big.
We'll turn around.
Is there anyone else?
That's good news, though, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It’s easy to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of punctuation marks is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.

That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.

Do you want us to take you home?
This house is made of bricks.
We did not draw any conclusions.
Tom came in around 2:30.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat flutter.
The crowd clapped.
I leave clover to grow on the stripes.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We're sedated.
I was too tired to continue.
Everything has its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's on his forehead.

Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look it up online.
When I was younger, I always hitchhiked.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was.

We have something to show you.
Can we wait for them here?
When I pee, something like pus comes out.
You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That'll teach them a lesson.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom crapped.
We're ready to fight.
I suggest you listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.

I'm ready.

Tom took a cookie.
I have been learning French since the age of 13.
Men are not so different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite oils for cleansing the face and nourishing the skin.
I'm sick of French.
I don't care if there are 20 women.
The bull's hurting.
Tom's walking.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't get it.
He was born in 1960.
Can I get one?
Babours are usually mild in taste.
I'm shocked.
It might rain today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Somebody told me that.
You're pretty.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I eat something?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bore you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Don't you want to start picking hair out of it?
How will you escape?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you going to do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd love to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That’s what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these midgets from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing to do.
It's in great condition.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary loves fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.
You look thoughtful.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It happens.
The noise will wake the baby up.
I'm late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the two-seater with Mary and watching TV.
Nothing's bothering us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
It's good to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I don't usually work on Mondays.
I'm a fool for trusting them.
Tom may need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be crushed.

Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dishwasher work?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, this soup is too salty.
Did I miss much?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You'll have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom caught two spots.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like best.
Your transgressions dishonor the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.

It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't concentrate on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became dependent.
All I want is money.
I don't say mean things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, I get blamed.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm tired of being called a liar.
Beggars can't pick.
Is there sugar?

It looked funny.

Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
Tom said that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have your hands full.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
He enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I paint with or without flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was released.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We do not sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I came back by bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The fight seems to be coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's distracted.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and it's over.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put the collage in the top drawer.
You've been in an accident, but you're gonna be okay.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our party.
I can make that happen.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes.
We'll be back in a month.
It is advisable to check to see if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you have been prescribed.

Do I need a lawyer?
We should get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom began to climb.
Tom likes you a lot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom squirms at Mary.
This is the first time I've put pepper on eggs.
I'll manage.
The cure worked.
Tom can play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you someplace where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, you sloth!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really likes us.
It's very rare.
I'm no good at this.
Tom sucked the candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything's ready.
She's moody.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Wipe it off.
Have you decided yet?
Tom's eavesdropping.
Can anyone hear me?
How you holding up?
Tom didn't know that.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I've got everything in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital recovering from what he overdosed on.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were about to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should check out Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's the man.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We've got her under surveillance.
Tom's mistrustful.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup lifted.
That's good training.
It's a capital city.
I should have said no.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I have lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my lib.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should feel sorry for them.
I'm not bargaining.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's quite a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Keep Tom busy.
They're just words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom swears too much.
Nobody walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through actions.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America, you're supposed to tip the waiter.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
I walk with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little awkward around Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the carriages.
I've been kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is delicious.
We're on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very strict with himself.
She's a nerd.
Lemonade is cold.
The lamp swung back and forth.
Tom seems unsure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom is a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the gangster in the square.
Hasn't anyone informed you that you don't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna lose it.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got stung.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care, Tom.
They look familiar.
We have a job for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you to be with me.
I like to play golf.
Tom took a deep interest in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get some rest?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
It was a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a painting.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're worried enough.
I don't think Tom's gonna do us much good.
Tom looks worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom came closer.
Tom looks shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is compassionate.
Keep it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could have handled it.
This is nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It has to come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, football field and billiard table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was pestering his sister.
We should've quit sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
So far, my efforts have been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You may come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trusting and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going down.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna bail.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genders in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was enchanted.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them around.
The noise disturbed the whole town.
He who loves flowers cannot be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom did.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing attack clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Chicks don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom acts like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you don't have the right to draw conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems bored.
I raise cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom participate, too?
The thief pretended to be a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
Let alone I could have helped you more.
Tom is no longer seen.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building. When I passed her by by by car, I did not recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's right.
I know you're busy.
All the children sat in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It's not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply moved by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My weight's leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes snapped.
The geyser expels a stream of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
Belkim, you're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
Someone has always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get ahold of him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to the elderly.
Gemstones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What made you come to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You eat a lot of chickens.
It was a beautiful day.
I got him to take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
Hastily lunched.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, French was the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I count to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed at Mary.
We don’t drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Is it possible to get there by car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom's got plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful ring.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom yelled at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me sort that out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'll go find another one.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make cobwebs.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom doesn't always have to believe what the other person says.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom groaned in pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're deranged!
That seems to be the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm going to do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think it's helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where do we eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound stopped.
Who cut your hair?
I don't quite understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palms.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How will Tom get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't bother.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It's been a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
Dismissed.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom likes to swim.
I'm gonna scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to babysit?
You're a real hater.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's in charge?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink the water.
Nobody's talking.
What do you think of contacting them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why that's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated any differently than I was before.
They should be fine.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was excited to listen to music.
Try her shirt on.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did you say Tom was gonna start his party?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a very good job.
My feet still hurt.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know the man sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I am open to everything.
I used to watch over you.
Stand where they are.
Are you a deceiver?
"She loves music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The nurse gave her a flu shot.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Silence, fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday falls on Sunday.
Everybody laughed.
Did Tom seem happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom does push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been in a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to an orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I was imagining it.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
Nobody came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
Nothing resembles a madman more than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom began to undress.
I know Tom does.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate with all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The robbers bound his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their arrogance.
Dan didn't miss any episodes of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We need to ask you a few questions, Tom.
I thought Tom was having a good time.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're canvassing the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
This is where we'll be.
Why are they doing this?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a lousy degree.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, only ash remained.
Tom likes any vegetable but cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll drive Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to compensate.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little harsh.
They decided to cut him out of their company.
Those who mix the verb endings "-tsya" and "-tsya" have a special place in hell.
What happened next?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
They seem to be everywhere.
I didn't count on it.
I was careless.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom caught her cleaning.
We're so angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom found two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I gave her nothing.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences this whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It really sucks.
You want some cheese?
They say that eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is chaste and pious.
I'll tell Tom.
I don't think I'll be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join in.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car running.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
I'm having fun.
We've all got to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
You need some help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is she?
Can people really be so foolish as to think that the entire population of Georgia, who speak a Caucasian language that has neither phonemes nor letters in common with English, can completely master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There's too much I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom was laughed at.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Each student has their own closet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I have something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to get rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him out of here.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They play volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I love learning French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned his lesson the hard way.
He showed my friends the forgery.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too short.
Excuse me.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm fed up.
He ate kale salad.
I'm going for a run.
Tom's chewing something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom has never visited Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and have a look.
Do you think you're likeable?
Innocence is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's pulse is racing.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept blabbing about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, brave, and I still don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
Busy bash.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to his victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
It's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I got embarrassed by the heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold on much longer.
Virtues are a reward in themselves.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to act here.
We should advertise on TV.
Tom nodded inaudibly.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right for me.
They've got a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
I have all these things waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
He seems very sleepy.
I made a mushroom bun yesterday.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a prize?
Believe in science!
Although the rain worm possesses both a male and a female reproductive system, it needs another individual to fertilize.
The failure embarrassed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom fainted.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm going that way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The temperature of the sun’s surface is estimated to be about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd's gone.
Tom started to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to look into it.
That was embarrassing.
I need Tom's address.
It's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom went.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did you want to eat, Tom?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
Have you ever written Tom a letter?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
A Cavalier would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't be so hard on me.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I got him something.
I would have said no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Luckily, this shed is stable, or the storm would have knocked it out last night anyway.
I heard they got her.
Tom's got everything written down somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'm gonna quit.
Mary’s eyes light up with joy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's evil to curse.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's being secretive.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller cheated him.
Everything is in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I've been thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom traveled to Boston.
I have dinner plans with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's simple.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I am looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatooeba.
Everything seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why aren't you singing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn’t know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a talk.
Tom's not into sports.
I'm stunned, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Call your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I love trying new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He's done wonders.
The glands secrete chemicals into the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom is resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
Somehow I felt sorry for her.
He is overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She injured her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could have said no.
Why wouldn't you let me help?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy in here.
What will happen will happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom meant.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to tie Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom behaved himself.
Guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay as you like.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play Truth or Dare.
Its conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started reading the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very nice.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a mermaid's song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife's getting sick of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amoebas are unicellular organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You're crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today it's more durable.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
Maybe someone was following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a piggy bank.
Let's just say I met her.
She smiled.
I'd like to talk to him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come over?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He just left.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You defeated me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be very useful for humanity.
I was helping them.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't fool me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's good-natured.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Would you like some sparkling water?
Tom winked at the girls.
We took a lot of trouble.
Tom looks different today.
Drop them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different features.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
Monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
Don't be so pervy!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your paycheck.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got small hands.
It bothers me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom launders money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you could swim?
Don't put pressure on Tom.
I've been betrayed.
And there's no paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll get a picture of how you made your speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb cremenadles, potatoes, and mushroom soup for dinner.
We waited for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom cheated on you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is hard.
I very rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke is rising in the air.
The printer isn't working.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We could order pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We drink water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the competition.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm an only child.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have a great deal of resistance to getting up early, even when you have to.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and lubricants for motors.
How was yesterday?
>>srp_Cyrl<< You have to learn hard.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You got sick, right?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
Dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I go to bed at 10:30.
I don't know where it went.
A boy ran up to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom remained calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I should go change.
How long have you worked as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died the day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom was soon lost in the crowd.
For the record, I'm not interested at all.
No, I'm still a bum.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you close your eyes when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I totally misjudged her.
It'll be over in a minute.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's snoring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can get him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the universe.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames from the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar?
How much you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and me, we're flying the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we might be able to help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does class start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird lifted its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether you buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man he was three years ago.
They all smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to make time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to break free.
What am I gonna do with them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not a good time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not old-fashioned.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Was there a bathing suit?
His nose is the best distinction.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's really cool.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
The simple question is yes.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I have a conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk on tequila.
In other words, he's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're a lot of babbling.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's got something going on.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I'm paying you my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom was out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could ever imagine.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
He lied to my eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to sneer.
They're listening.
I didn't know Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he's gone.
They'd only get in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It concerns you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They framed him for murder.
No response from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom had his shirt on.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was really good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm teasing.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's papers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom snorted loudly.
It was Bether.
Tom began to snore.
I'm gonna ask you to stay a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Maybe Tom'll be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was frantic.
Can's empty.
There's grapes in the cooler.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom shook his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The fumes clouded my glasses.
So, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the Al flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't understand you.
Even though I'm a godly man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I should know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so mad.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the prize.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does the same thing Mary does.
We need to investigate something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom began to say something, but Mary silenced him.
We met at the tavern.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Night life is better in New York.
Please come in.
Medication should be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got it wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
You baked a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't grind.
Tom's regained consciousness.
Tom angered Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom may be coming today.
Tom doesn't know the difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom doesn't have willpower.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I came back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard it from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it.
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We left at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me anything you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of another dimension.
They bore me.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my piece of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for that yet.
Each member must attend.
She didn’t understand the joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
Doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're righteous.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
He sprained his collarbone while playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
That's where I was with Tom.
Show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
You really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was impertinent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something miraculous happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked if I was cooking.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom wailing.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be nervous about it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Did you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser.
Tom's crazy as hell.
Do it again!
Don't cost him his heart.
There's no need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look stunned.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave my house for a pair of slippers.
I think Tom's a schmuck.
They got a terrible infection and the ovary started.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't work.
It's out of the question.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
Sometimes he behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was really stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes to gossip.
I have tons of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language has a different view of the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a heathen.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we made out.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty warm for a december?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you bump into him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You raised your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I've been a little on edge.
