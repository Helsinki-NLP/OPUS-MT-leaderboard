It's like summer out there.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
They're waiting for us.
What's your story?
Begin.
You have no idea how right you are.
I've been looking for you.
It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?

These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
What school did you go to?
The clouds are getting darker.
He's gentle by nature.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
As long as we live, our heart does not stop beating.
One senator called the president of another country, an officer of the old intelligence service who would like to reclaim the old empire of that country.
Would you like some more tea?
The nail punctured a tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You always sing.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
>>bos_Latn<< Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth twitched.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
Little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Get up.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom is still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets furious if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in this town.
They already have one.
There's really no need to do that.
Is your watch accurate?
I hope it's dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 50 passengers died.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what's going on behind that door.
I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother said to me was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
How do we know he's innocent?
Did you wash the dishes?
>>bos_Latn<< When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The best lecture you can attend is the one you don't understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't stare.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I wrote his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom suggests could save all of us time.
Italy is a peninsula.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Sure!
>>bos_Latn<< Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everyone else did.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife, Edith.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It’s hard to give up long-term love at once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
A strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Good luck!
Let's talk about this over lunch.
Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company is on shaky feet because of its bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We must respect our personal rights.
What's that thing on your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't run before the ore!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he couldn't.
Jumi's gonna be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is a Yugoslav.
There's got to be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
Tom must have been trying to clean this up without soap.
It was raining so hard that we decided to visit it another day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
>>bos_Latn<< His unkindness angered her.
She rejected my proposal.
Trains in Serbia are very slow.
In that case, let's go.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but did not send it to her.
Gymnastics is his strong suit.
He has a good memory.
Tom was fired.
The limbs are numb from the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
There is a hero in a hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're sincere.
Come play with us.
Do you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists ignore this fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't stretch out.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
>>bos_Latn<< It took four kilograms of gold to gild the winning medals.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to put numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't shout.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
This was a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income is down 10 percent.
You'll see her.
It can be difficult to get around unfamiliar terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Yum, you're a fast cheese.
Okay, you don't have it.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After much consideration, I ended up making things at random.
It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
They were walking along the beach.
We're shrinking.
Can you talk to me?
Turn the TV down.
I wear short-sleeved shirts in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom hoped to become a celebrated writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's the Avis counter?
Don't be a road bully.
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just on my way.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'm coming home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's job is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
>>bos_Latn<< If there is no porn with that, porn will be made with that.
Canada is the mother country of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving up so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
How about you?
This is without a doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road leads to the city.
I'm not happy about it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I baked my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start studying.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find the book in the library.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never noticed that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
That's fantastic!
I didn't do it either.
How much does a beer cost?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to kiss Maria.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers blooming.
That's too bad.
His brother's a very capable doctor.
I'm tired of fighting.
I've got plenty of room.
What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't shout.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
The young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
You think so?
Can we agree to disagree?
I'm trying to be careful.
Always trouble when it comes to my kid.
Not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
Don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I worked on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, where there's water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 points on her math exam.
No one else was allowed in the room.
Better by grace than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no “freedom” in the Russian language.
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's run away.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
>>bos_Latn<< She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I wasn't told anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The fire spread to an adjacent building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
Bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never take me alive!
>>bos_Latn<< It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Close your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He took off.
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
He's an American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
Without a doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
That's a quick fattening.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing multiple things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Let your imagination run free.
How about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
What have you done to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a pain in the ass.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your foolish business.
The light disappeared by itself.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the police!
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have five fingers on each hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving up to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What do newspapers write?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Repairs were completed on the system after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She called me very late the last night.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in a white house.
>>bos_Latn<< The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You failed me.
Hello, how are you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< She received four emails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom manages to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just won't do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It is their right to vote.
It's hard to put into words what I mean.
Tell me where you are.
Will we ever see Tom again?
Turn right at the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope they don't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too hard.
>>bos_Latn<< Avoid addicts on paint thinner.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller coasters?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a good time today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletarians of all lands, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
Tom's easy to hang out with.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have a right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You need to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom twirled around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how that is possible.
Santa lives at the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll keep you posted.
>>bos_Latn<< We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black grand piano with dramatic finger strokes, creating music that is very enjoyable to listen to.
>>bos_Latn<< Strong winds broke off many branches from the trees last night.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
>>bos_Latn<< There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed because of his mistake.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
>>bos_Latn<< The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I can't help feeling partially responsible.
People were nice to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I scratch for a cigarette?
I could come with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
The Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
How many blankets are on the bed?
There's really no need to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom plans to do.
I'm fat.
To join the choir, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom took a nap.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I take vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
>>srp_Cyrl<< You're very uneducated.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is beneficial for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself priority over the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Insensitive, numb children can grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like it to be at your place.
It's the police's job to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning really fast.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hate of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks knew how to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep children away from medication.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work for an hour and a half.
It's the right thing.
Your time will soon come.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll think of something.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You drink coffee?
Some of us think such views are madness.
It works.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write a single letter to Mary while he was away.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
She's Chinese.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
We need to be prudent.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom's got a big end to it.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a little nauseous.
Is this the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I've soaked it to the skin.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great suffering.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by poorly understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Explore this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Please help us find this card.
Can you tell the difference between silver and tin?
Hands up!
I don't exercise as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I am a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it is impossible to live.
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter were two generations old.
We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
>>bos_Latn<< He plotted to himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
Resting my legs.
The professor's excuse is almost perfect.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
Love you!
I'm really proud of that.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
That's not like you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She achieved her goal.
I'm twice the age of Tom.
Madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this right now.
Have fun.
Time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The debrief on the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I yawned with wonder.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." "And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review of Mac." "...Yes."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I don't want to take up any more of your time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
>>srp_Cyrl<< "Did he elaborate?" "He did."
Not all lights are magic.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was very excited.
You don’t have to eat right before you go to sleep.
Tom will wait.
What's gonna happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students didn’t know how to respond.
Shame on you for lying.
I'm not a night owl.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should be doing this.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit a torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's truth in what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
>>bos_Latn<< The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm looking into it right now.

We know her.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
>>bos_Latn<< The accident occurred on Sunday around 3:00 p.m.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
It doesn't affect him at all.
I thought the food was great.
Fifty families live in this small village.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom is an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and mute when I'm eating.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Does your head hurt?
You have to learn English step by step.
Tom's better off now than he was before.
Jesus and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for my opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would be even wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is also the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of eternal life, and would long for death.
Water is a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my father-in-law.
I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news has come.
No one really wants us.
They all paid for it.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
Alone.
How about you?
Do not drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold changes every day.
Be nice.
Look around you!
Tom's married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is painting trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a scoundrel.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It really is pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brutus?
The house where Ataturk was born was in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It's snowing.
I thought you might need some help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.
He was elected president.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They formed a swimming team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom was jumping up and down.
Tom's dog lay down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
Nope.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message, Mary?
I'll save you a front row seat.
Mary pushes her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
Small flowers bloom at night.
I counted to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One day you should try.
I'll stay home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What do you conclude?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his nerve.
Bathroom's upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in a hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You are average students.
>>bos_Latn<< In childhood, many violent criminals ruthlessly tortured animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be mad and yell at us?
Please stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
It seems she was offended by what he said to her.
I love playing music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak louder than words.
Is this where Tom's sitting?
Enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's gaining weight.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Guilty as charged.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
Some old houses need to be demolished.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I'm so tired I can't study.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very considerate.
When are you going to leave?
This report is not written very well.
I want a new bike.
She points out that this latest move by the government has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It lasted about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer.
The five brothers worked together on the farm.
Could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my friend request on Facebook.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
>>bos_Latn<< One Oslo student who forged his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made the vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I will finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself that's the problem, it's all these damning questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend has arrived.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What have you both done?
I really want to see her.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started shouting.
I'll come back when I've finished my homework.
Clean it up.
>>srp_Cyrl<< May I use your vocabulary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I got burned.
Step back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch yourself here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by spraying rocks on your car.
I became a pensioner after working in the office for forty-five years.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't support him.
I just took a bath.
Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously hurt.
Generally, children love sweets.
Tom will cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car on my own.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not going into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely made the cut.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's got no equal.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. At the time I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom's not getting away.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Down!
Tom couldn't take it.
Anything you can think of can help.
You’ll feel better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the side of guys like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay?
Anyway, he'll definitely come.
Please keep this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel like crying.
I'm sympathetic.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be finished soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Either way, you're wrong.
He won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's quiet again.
I failed.
We know.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and different materials.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much is that?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Have some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm getting hungry from all this running.
I'm a translator.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider tickles.
Talk about others how you would like them to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
Seems okay to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Reaction is not always the best course of action.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
>>bos_Latn<< The committee recommends that those who have complained should be reimbursed with a proportional portion of the annual fee with interest.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money too.
Well, it's over.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the file name before attempting to recover deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
I got a lot going on.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
It is not necessary to throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't split hairs.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom make a big deal out of it?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We also call Robert "Bob."
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The government fell after a vote in parliament.
You're not funny.
Tom left instead of Mary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The notebook isn't yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car down the street.
I don't know much Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I was very shocked by the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was cold as a syringe.
There is no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We studied all afternoon.
Are you going to mail this?
What do you suggest?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm too late, aren't I?
Don't stare.
It looks blue to you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We've all run out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives behind God's feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She called him, but he didn’t hear her.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will probably win the championship.
After silence, what most accurately expresses the unspeakable is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
Tom and Mary would make a wonderful couple.
How to say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass the exams?
We're gonna have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How about we make a group on Facebook so we can discuss foreign language learning?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hall.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Quit smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
But why?
Can I take a look at your ticket?
What happens now?
Be careful, it's a very sharp knife.
They've rigged the library with new books.
It's clear.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How about some chocolate cheese?
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing mistake.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to be idle during a student's life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that.
We'll miss you very much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will look.
Tom was eating a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could come with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cost of living is growing.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you defuse the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs have you written?
Where's your head?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language. On Tatoeba all languages are equal.
How can we control others when we can’t control ourselves?
Don't rush it.
She's Thai.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He dedicated his life to realizing the vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you helped lately?
Just close your eyes.
She doesn't like football.
Tom's a little worried.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I overlook this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.
What should I write here?
I'm deeply ashamed.
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
I don't know who they are.
He repairs electronic devices.
Sing, please.
You lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to stand up to this.
Where's the toothpaste?
Mrs. Klein is in her eighties, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Gardening is fun.
It's never too late to learn.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever uploaded a video to YouTube?
>>bos_Latn<< I was very interested in participating in building a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me some books.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm into her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you right now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her ups and downs on the journey.
Suck my dick.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I love cable food.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
>>bos_Latn<< The Queen and the King reunited their powers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This takes an eternity.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
>>bos_Latn<< The flowers are fully instilled.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book the least.
You look good in blue.
How did you do this?
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why have you been silent all this time?
He took off his clothes.
He saw Leila's reaction.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He got away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
Get up!
You really should take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Mayuko was avoiding hard work.
She has short hair.
Drive slow.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.
Did you do something?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everybody appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does it happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
The Chairman opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was raining.
Take it all.
I wish there was a God.
I've checked in.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Same-sex marriage is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve my congratulations.
I miss you so much.
Since the note was in French, I read it easily.
This might hurt a little.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you pass the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll study harder.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us saw Tom do it.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
Embarrass her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend was not supportive.
I had dinner with him.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
The teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What do you got?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Is it me?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's no trifle.
Control yourselves.
I'm tired a lot, but I'm fine.
Butter is made from milk.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
You're wrong.
Several trees fell during a storm in our vicinity.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
Do you have trouble understanding what your wife or small children are showing you?
Cathy seems to like music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove it?
We're trying.
I quit.
You disappoint me.
Tom looked angry.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Sorry.
I haven't been home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay till tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's everything, just not honest.
The bullet pierced the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the photo!
That helps us a lot.
I've filled my glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
This morning, Mary visited the whole village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
Heather trusts me.
I just got here.
I played with Tony yesterday.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I know him well.
Without the tool there is no trade.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not at all worried.
It helps.
>>bos_Latn<< Dima slept with 25 men in the course of one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The costs will soon rise.
I work in a language school.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
It's always been like that.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Deaf people can talk in sign language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jane lies ill in bed.
I'm warning you!
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you have to do?
Cows give milk.
Tom likes to drive.
I've been looking for you.
I'm a woman.
It's all important.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The whole country is talking about it!
Winter's over, spring's here.
Which way are you going?
It's really that simple.
With such a price, your product will not survive competition in the Japanese market.
I met your dad yesterday.
Since these newspapers had written that no farmer wanted to work as a tenant in Westfold, interest grew rapidly.
I'm grounded.
I need to get inside.
We're a little busy here.
All aboard.
Good luck with your job!
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
You're standing in my aisle.
It's getting dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
Elbrus is the highest mountain in Europe.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask questions of the teacher every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
I'm not free today.
If the world were not as it is now, I could trust everyone.
>>bos_Latn<< Three of the injured, for whom it is currently unclear what condition they are in, were evacuated to the U.S. Field Hospital.
I prayed for you.
When was this book published?
Ethereum and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
You guys all right?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
They lived happily ever after.
Tom is blushing.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
I'm going to marry a beautiful Estonian.
My car's in the garage.
Give me another example.
Who sent me a telegram?
His condition has improved.
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
He doesn't know where he should be.
I'm hurrying.
We're done for the day.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, general precautions should be taken to avoid infection in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like big people.
I won't say anything.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Put the book on the top shelf.
He's sleepy.
I can't fix the car on my own.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips twisted into an ominous smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
>>bos_Latn<< Mary's enthusiasm for the course waned when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
Mary wasn't worthy of your trust.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous as he started a new job.
When do you usually get up?
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
You're not allowed to smoke here.
Simplicity is the height of refinement.
What does he live on?
I assumed you were busy.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
Call Tom.
Tom's always very nice.
I've barely got my eye on it.
What would I do without you?
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took my wig off.
I have no one but her.
You're reckless.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
That's new.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm gonna take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They will know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
Please, sit down.
I just want to get out of here.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
What makes you say that?
I am death.
Little kids like to touch everything.
She curled her hair with papillolets.
He was released from military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot.
They work together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you to the dance.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She makes a mosquito out of an elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He was more a member of the social elite than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me a pen.
Your answer is incorrect.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'll probably never use this again.
I don't have a ticket.
Bye!
He's an American.
You seem like a very smart person.
It's amazing.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year for training.
There's a cup of tea and an egg on the table.
>>bos_Latn<< The house burned down to the ground before firefighters arrived.
You should have told Tom.
>>bos_Latn<< The months with the most rain are May, June, July, and August.
Do I usually look happy?
Tom lives in Paris.
I've already written part of the report.
You're human.
I was ready for that.
Show me the documents.
It has to do with...
It's hard to be passionate, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing dishes?
I pulled an ace.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
Tom will pay.
Tom lost his job.
The hunting season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with beer.
Thank God.
Is that what Tom gave you?
She's spending the holidays at her uncle's.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
Ladies have an advantage.
I'm motivated.
What's your name?
What a tragedy!
We're here.
It's mine, not his.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
I live in Chile.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their innate talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.
You let me down.

I don't think you should rush into anything these few days.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
What is eternal in nature, when everything is so fleeting?
He's an American.
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind blows like a blizzard.
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
I'll take the car into town, and I can drop you off on the way.
This may not be enough.
Party's at Tom's house tonight.
You got that right.
Why do you need so many shoes?
Everything you have will one day have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to email his shirt at least once a week.
They may need some money.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
The situation is urgent.
They had a fight.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Who wounds early, two fortunes snatch.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
These are Spanish villages for me.
This town isn't big enough for the two of us.
Tom paused for a moment.
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Better a sparrow in hand, than a dove on a branch.
Do you have time to have lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's possible to do that.
Tom thinks I don't know what he said.
I'm going to take a nap in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
It's as warm today as it was yesterday.
>>bos_Latn<< He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alco-test, before being sent for laboratory testing.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
Come to my house.
It's been a stressful day.
Her name is Lucifer.
Don't move!
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom watched closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
Who in the family wears pants?
What the fuck?
Tom's undercover.
I want to be with you.
The infidels mocked the bishop's interpretation.
>>bos_Latn<< This was refined and embodied in a personality so strange, rigid and stubborn that few dared to work closely with it.
She's pregnant.
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.
Don't move!
Hurry.
I could be there by 2:30.
Have fun while you can.
Merauke is the easternmost city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here a lot as a student.
We'll take the next one.
>>bos_Latn<< He maintains his youth by running.
If you act like a fool, you will be treated like one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a ghost story.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
Check everyone.
I was sick and had to stay at home.
Session's over.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I baked bread.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why are you acting like a child?
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
What's the Wi-Fi code?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
He's Chinese.
>>bos_Latn<< Chop the cheese into thin slices or into small cubes.
Stop worrying.
We'll have to wait and see.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
I'd like to get started.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
I'm as hungry as a wolf.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused a real stir.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He left a few minutes ago.
I believe you're sincere.
I don't know why I pay any more attention.
The university was founded by his father twenty years ago.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Even though I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and consciousness, and should act towards each other in a spirit of brotherhood.
It will take forever.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm touched.
If I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Tom will help anyone who asks for help.
Why not?
"Where do I sit?" "Anywhere."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for a deaf audience.
You didn't answer the question.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How to get rid of a mole in the garden?
I like Korean food.
I have confidence in you.
It's Saturn.
Stop grumbling.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I can't sit still.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
We learn to read and write in school.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Tatoeba: Where attention is for the details of the world, and punishment is swift.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
How was your day?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is an ex-con.
Where are you now?
It is very likely that FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He wears a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of that.
>>bos_Latn<< Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
We took great care of you.
The children were eager for attention.
It's hers, isn't it?
I want to answer the last question first.
Is that what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only 5:00 in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
>>bos_Latn<< If there is, a crossover with it will happen eventually.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
The sea is blowing!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom stalled.
I know this is weird.
Please, continue.
He never got over his son's death.
When are you leaving?
I'm just doing my duty.
Tom disappeared into thin air.
They all sat down.
>>bos_Latn<< If you have nothing else to do, then the number of the Greek Islands.
She's always wearing tattered clothes.
Good always defeats evil.
Will it soon solve the problem?
I don't care what he says.
Mary put a ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do it.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
He's an American.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
>>bos_Latn<< The devotees of Vishnu are called Vishnuans; the devotees of Shiva are Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I have completely lost the flow of my thoughts.
Two bags of cement will suffice.
I never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak gypsy?
Tom came to see me at noon yesterday.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
"I think completion is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things that people do I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
That kid kept crying for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all limits.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his mother tongue.
Her words made him angry.
I laughed.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm completely penniless.
I almost forgot my passport.
I've been looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
Enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
He who eats the sword, dies by the sword.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom looked very confused.
I'm coming home tomorrow.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They've done an unthinkable job.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He overdid it again with a drink.
Just tell Tom I called.
>>bos_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding has to be perfect.
Move over.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She doesn't like being told what to do.
We should be studying.
When a grape is born on the willow!
We have no other choice.
When it's like this, it's best to sit at home and not go out.
A man's character is his destiny.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Play it again, Sam.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom made Mary do it.
Tom, I need your help.
I brought you some coffee.
During the observational power experiment, Tom could not describe any of the pictures on the wall of his living room, although he lived there for two years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I've never seen Tom this busy.
Looks like you haven't been yourself lately.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence this is.
Tom was buying time.
Everyone held their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What did you like the most along the way?
I love watching you work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom suggested that Maria go to the doctor.
I hope to visit Beijing.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
There's a Mr. Itoh to see you.
Be careful.
She'll pay a maximum of $50.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at 1:30.
What's his name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna shit myself.
I'm a vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
>>bos_Latn<< To strive to maximize one's own interest, happiness, or security seems very natural to a human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
I have a few gifts.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not nearly as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
That was just the beginning.
Have you finished your homework?
Over the last few days I’ve been doing research regarding making money using the project, but I think all the options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is a tricky thing.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the rings on the tree and found that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems upset.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
You are my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary is Tom's only daughter.
He still has no experience with this job.
Can you help us?
Will you get cold?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
I changed my mind.
Based on the information I gave you, what story would you come up with?
>>bos_Latn<< Who cannot be proud to be a Serb, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of chiefs and genocides?
>>bos_Latn<< This makes it more one-sided.
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Are you going to invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom will look.
I wonder if anyone could help me. I have a cell phone that just shows an error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I miss her.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom played on the strongest card.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
What is your favorite YouTube video?
Millie listens to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.
Are you gonna turn me in?
You can't blame everything on Tom.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
We're just getting started.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Please, get out of the way.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
I just finished it.
We're talking about the wolf, and the wolf is at the door.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I get the impression he knows the secret.
It was kind of weird.
Tom won't pass the exam.
Will you do that for me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
In the beginning is my end.
Can we humans digest grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
How would you translate that?
It's almost half past three.
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
Chances are against me.
I'll quit.
The kids are playing outside.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Do what you want, I don't care at all.
She expects us to help her.
Who are you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Call me anytime, I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstand me.
That's good.
I'm not gonna push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thank you for coming!
What's your blood type?
Are we leaving soon?
I found him a book.
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Do you have news for me?
I'm thirsty.
It's our duty to help them.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Thank Tom for his help.
Simplicity is the highest level of refinement.
What have you both done?
Happy birthday!
The weather stays bad.
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and tranquility, are true masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
You want to meet her?
I'll never mention this again.
We're out of food.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You're the boss.
We have two children.
I think Tom's being careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot my baby monitor.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is prohibited in all restaurants.
You don't have to come to the office, take the day off.
>>bos_Latn<< The white family will arrive in Tokyo at half-past eleven.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write down the steps for you.
Tom's probably still hiding.
This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Shit happens.
Look out!
>>bos_Latn<< Tom failed to produce any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We should not look down on the poor.
You have a bad temper.
Is this your phone?
I was just on my way.
They separated after their wedding anniversary.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He took care of the child.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a very bad day.
The whole country is talking about it.
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made the omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
I was happy yesterday.
>>bos_Latn<< By the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary.
What would you like to know?
Now's not a good time.
He's not a kid anymore.
I try to ventilate the futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's scratched again.
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
That aunt and man are holding hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I walk you home?
I just saw the Saudi ambassador resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
Call me.
Tom still looks upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
>>bos_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came in a little earlier than usual today.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I could eat a horse.
I never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What do you have to do?
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train on his way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Horses are sleeping standing up.
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snorri Sturluson speak, among other things, of the spread of Christianity in Norway through violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourselves at home!
The students didn’t know how to respond.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
How long have you been running?
That elegant gold-plated necklace with hearts is a necklace that will "shake your world".
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining heavily.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're being irrational.
I'm angry.
Don't argue with me.
The dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do it right the first time.
Marie jumped into the river from the window.
She was crying.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
He invited her to a rendezvous.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
Check, please.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest types of vegetables.
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Can you enjoy this book?
The capital of Serbia is Belgrade.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary are always walking around holding hands.
Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We heard her crying.
It's been a big help.
You don't have to yell, I'm not deaf!
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We have no choice.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she should be avoided.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He's given up.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is one big, friendly dog in a small room, and every time he wags his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works at the hospital.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look at the size of it!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late because of the accident.
For breakfast I always eat fruit and oatmeal.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest checking the water quality once a year in pipes, twice in a well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
>>bos_Latn<< I feel like I've been thrown into a big nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a very long time.
This history tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt you just for a second?
I hate science.
The students didn’t know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you either.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Men remain children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
Just looking around.
Where is the beach?
You want to know something specific?
Welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
>>bos_Latn<< Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Maria is the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What happens now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is the time of snow.
Under what name?
>>srp_Cyrl<< What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
How it came, how it went.
Give him time.
He who waits, waits.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
>>bos_Latn<< At that point, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
Try again.
It's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
>>bos_Latn<< A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Her childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
He wouldn't like that.
I have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom double-parked.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising out of any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went for a walk.
Are there any other options?
The amount of work done and interest in the invested capital were several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who's paying.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't entirely agree with you.
It's a nice day.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I will send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapporo.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a teacher.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no need to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated about us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
>>bos_Latn<< American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours straight.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
>>bos_Latn<< Fadil demanded that Dania give him money.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a good presentation for the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's five to two.
I think you should take the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he should be doing.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom chased away the flies.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to disprove it.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black, and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's a cup on the table.
That pisses me off.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I drink milk.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was able to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom comes back safe.
I have no idea what was going on in his head to reject such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough, but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us were eating hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good child, you need to go to bed and get up early.
How about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do it.
Where you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned to love.
Don't be a loafer.
This is how it's supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
>>bos_Latn<< The future looks bleak for Edmond Dantes, having become a victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're being irrational.
My French sucks.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
It stinks.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Faith can move mountains.
One foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a delight.
He's crazy as hell.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter sooner.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I've sung to you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me the least bit.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks very different from what it was before.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbits' ears so big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
There are no souls.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to handle things on the go.
You're working too hard.
This one's pretty cool.
Don't say a word.
I really enjoyed it.
That can be trusted to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I was late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
It's 5 a.m. in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom has been arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
>>bos_Latn<< Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
You don't learn that in school.
Is it clear?
I don't feel like going out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live out of water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy, I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not doing it!
I'm tired of fighting.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Every bit of it!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get into trouble.
I just want to get away.
>>bos_Latn<< Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let a chance like this slip through your fingers.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
He's in his freshman year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to the weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I have your dictionary?
My fluent knowledge of the language is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my, often mutually contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
>>srp_Cyrl<< She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
Great!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't arrived yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
>>bos_Latn<< His novels are favorites among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he didn't want to wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were no injuries.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His misfortune has taught me much.
Are we ready to go?
Why not?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
>>bos_Latn<< Vivaldi wrote many musical works for bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry fractured his right femur in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where there are many grandmothers, there are children.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is as tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was just whipped cream on a cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were amazing.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
The brakes are squeaky.
Did you make a full recovery?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a twat.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
>>bos_Latn<< The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the destra side is in New York City.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
>>bos_Latn<< Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Introduce me to Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After a long consideration, I ended up making things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He is a man of words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
That's true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You've failed me.
One should not judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
What is this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me too.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and distributed a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
Phase one is complete.
You'll be famous.
He has a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked to his left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It is important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The brakes squeaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like beans.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a poem he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a difficult decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope there will be good weather tomorrow.
Maria nodded.
Let's sit.
Come and have a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I quit.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom for a bit.
He's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
>>bos_Latn<< Nothing can be done but to admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Drop dead!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
My watch needs fixing.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
I had a quick lunch.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
I need you to leave a message for Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he was never on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where'd you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
>>bos_Latn<< As little as we know of its origin, at least we can be sure it is the pilot of the Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.

Can you give an example?

He stole a very valuable diamond ring.
That's my cat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom drinks like a smock.
Just like old times.

Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That's not like you.
He's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.

You always do.
That's totally normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.

Some people think spontaneous inflammation really happens, but I'm not so sure.

It's too loud for me here.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about that.
Tom's alone.
If she'd been a little more patient, she could have made it.
Whatever you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?

The only word written on the page was "frog".

Do you speak Italian?
That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I stayed.
Tom ate a slice of pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.

Just give us a chance.
Be careful.
Tom's on the stage.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
Have another one.

This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
I thought you were taking the Bosto bus.
We're going for a walk.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you'd already taken care of it.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom was shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what might happen.
Do good to those who hate you.
I nodded once.
Hello, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
Who's your favorite TV star?
Tom fainted.
How was your day?
He's not the kind of person who steals.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
We can talk about this in the future.
We won't let you down.
Don't waste your words.
We don't get many visitors down here.
I love him, but he's often too sensitive.
She divorced her husband.
>>bos_Latn<< Many languages of euphemisms describe death and dying.

I wish I could paint like that.
I'm loyal.

Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
Could you read it?

Hey.
Tom's gonna make it.

Tom's a busy guy.
You look very pale.

I've lost the flow of thought.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom took out some ID.
You're embarrassing her.
My phone's about to go off.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch our legs.
I'm going on a trip.
That'll be all for now.
Interesting, he's coming today?
The powerless must be protected from the powerful.
I don't know if these languages are related.

How long does a turtle live?
Haven't you done enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.

Here they appear to enjoy a fountain with ice, beer and a picnic basket.
Tom told me not to.
We went all the way to Boston together.
How long have you been a teacher?

We have no such example.

How about you?
There is no free lunch.

I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Tom knows what he likes.
Tom was very sleepy.
>>bos_Latn<< This building will be built in the city.
Come closer.
Come on!

Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Don't go out tonight.
Don't strain yourself!
Can you wake me up at seven in the morning?
He always goes to work at 8:00 in the morning.
No controversy is ever over. It will always surface again.

I'm a rookie.
This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I'm ready.
I'm against war.
She's walking.
He's got a nice patina on him.
Tom didn't give it to me.
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
I've already tried that.
You're my mother.
Italy is not Greece.
I'm just not very happy.
I don't live in this town.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
I'll cooperate.
I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.
Give me an example.
It all happened at the speed of light.
Fight!
That's really nice.
I've been called worse.
How did I miss that?
I'm not at all surprised.
I saved you a seat next to me.
Looks like the victim tried to write the killer's name in her own blood.
Being powerful is like being a lady. If you need to tell people you are, then you're not.
Tom might have something to do with it.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they say she's only with me for the night.
What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Were you in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm leaving.
I pissed him off.
That's very rare.
I pretended not to see.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I tried to be kind.
Can you ask her to call me?
I pretended not to see.
Have you seen my dog?
It's getting dark.
Don't yell.
You know your rights.
You can't go in that room.
That's the point.
The whole town was underwater.
I didn't know where I was from.
Don't come in!
What do they call him?
Tom tried the button.
Can you pass the salt?
I'm ashamed that my son did such a thing.
Success was only partial.
He always leaves for work at 8:00 in the morning.
I'm not 100% sure.
You want to bet?
He didn't like the look of his nose, so he had a nose job.

Tom knows the Secretary of State.
Tom just got home.
Quit smoking.
The fuse's blown.
Don't answer that.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
Ladies first.
It can't be hard; otherwise, women wouldn't be able to do it
I'm glad people saw that.
She's not ugly.
I'm sick of his preaching.
No one would talk to me.
>>bos_Latn<< Also Piotr and Lech are good friends.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I have a gun.
We're overpaid for the paper.
Tom seems very nice.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He has a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money do they make per month?
What a stupid question!
I'm restless.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was as angry as a lynx.
Stand up and introduce yourself, please.
We're all eager to see the movie.
You have to solve your own problems.
Where do you live, Tom?
He laughed contentedly.
Tom's got good notes.
That's no reason to panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom was celebrating his high school reunion last week.
I'll sit at the table over there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't say a word!
Your book is twice as big as mine.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's have a look.
Tom writes something in his diary every night, no matter how tired he is.
Did you plan anything special?
My parents died.
Most scientists believe that this is caused by human activity, through the release of methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, since the time of industrialization. But still, few other scientists doubt this.
Will I be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I can resist anything, except temptation.
He just needs to practice.
I paid for it.
Louder, please.
I didn't say I did it.
They know you.
You were right to worry.
I wish you'd keep an eye on my dog while I'm out.
I'm confused.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring a fan?
How much time do I have left?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
You remind me a little of Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you are.
Did you get the number?
You're under oath.
I fainted.
I wish I'd known.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
It's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Tom was able to save just a little money.
I'm gonna leave work early today.
Are you enjoying your work?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for something specific?
Its composition is very good, except for a few mistakes in pronunciation.
English is considered an international language.
Don't worry!
We're going to Boston and Chicago.
I'm a monk.
I currently live in Boston.
Ania has black hair and Magdalena has blue hair.
Why did you decide to stop using Twitter?
I'm not a philologist.
Am I a suspect?
I could help.
For God's sake!
Haven't you done enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom will give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I have a feeling it's gonna rain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Caroline is sad, because she can't get pregnant.
He has a few friends.
Did you sleep?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Tom looks a little dazed.
I'm really happy about that.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's certainly no cause for concern.
I took my wig off.
My life was good.
That's my cat.
>>bos_Latn<< Here is a large amount of minor errors and minor misunderstandings that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I haven't had any complaints so far.
I can ski.
He's standing right there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the front desk.
He is known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go look for Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot your feet!
"Are you serious?" "I'm totally serious."
Why are you mad at me?
I'd rather have a checkup in the morning.
He didn't like the way Mary talked to him.
We need to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom needs to learn more if he's going to finish his class.
I'm tired of fighting.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I can't taste it!
It's too easy that way.
How's that?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Bears are very dangerous.
Oh, really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
We had to call the police last night.
I'm worried about you.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
She is the Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come pick me up.
I like the way you fixed up the place.
She decided not to go.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom travelled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
It's a fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did it, didn't I?
>>bos_Latn<< No one noticed she was absent until after the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom was?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
It doesn't work with me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom used to drive the bus.
You want some coffee?
In the autumn, many birds move south.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
>>bos_Latn<< That article was spelt in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
You're about to make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll go.
What's all the fuss about?
Can you please turn off the radio for me?
There is a bus station near our school.
Don't drink the water.
I'm adopted.
No one knows what will happen next.
I've made up my mind.
Do you have a copy?
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
We're going to the movies.
I don't understand why they're such good friends.
Dan is a linguist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
In this stage of world history, there is no such thing as our own independent press. You know it and I know it. There is no one among you who dares to write your honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I get my regular salary to keep my honest opinion out of the newspapers I work for. Many of you have also been thinking about the same things you are doing.
I'm not at all worried.
The bedroom is upstairs.
It's mine, not his.
I could use some help.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom couldn't get Mary to make the cake for John's birthday party.
Tom writes very well.
Tom frowned at himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
It's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it on my hands.
Somehow you let me know you wanted me to ask you out.
It is recommended that you do not write down your passwords where others can see them.
That's so funny.
Look again.
How could I do that?
Did you eat anything?
Tom was very supportive.
Silk is expensive.
What are you going to do today?
I'd rather not be involved at this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
Only I can do that here.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Taxis are expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom will recover.
There's no use trying to talk him into it.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The Milky Way is a vast belt of distant stars similar to our sun.
Who is it?
I could talk to Tom.
Naoko lives in a white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing well.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.
He's a man of great experience.
A beautiful blonde was sunbathing on the beach.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
We're trying.
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously hurt.
I need your help.
Hold it!
The airline will make sure to send your luggage all the way to the final destination as soon as possible, or later if the traveler so wishes.
I was just too busy.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
What's this all about?
I'd like to kiss you.
He owned a lot of land, once upon a time.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Tom laughed at the idea.
She was wearing pushy clothes.
I'll be right there.
He was awfully thin.
I'm so sorry.
What did she look like?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
>>bos_Latn<< The coliseum was used until 217, but then it was struck by lightning and burned.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It's time for you to go to sleep.
You're absolutely right.
I consider him an enemy.
You deserve it.
I do.
Does Tom have a lawyer?
You changed my life.
Can I have your dictionary?
He ran away from her.
If a man has the right to life, then he should also have the right to death.
>>bos_Latn<< All teachers were young and liked to teach.
Faith does wonders!
He was holding his breath.
Tom's a connoisseur.
Congratulations!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bird on the roof is a crow.
My house is far away.
I've never really been anywhere.
We're in a difficult situation.
I'll check now.
Check again.
Come with us, please.
Sammy's missing a plank in his head.
You don't look so good.
What's the name of that restaurant?
How to call a taxi?
There are many beautiful parks in London.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom kissed with anger.
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
When did you get home?
They know you.
You didn't answer the question.
This dictionary contains 1,000 words, all of which must be remembered by July.
It's too loud for me here.
There's a good chance we're gonna win.
We have to go back.
Do you think it's possible to pass all the exams?
It would be different.
They're all there.
Is that your car?
Did you bring a hairdryer?
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Did you talk about me?
Tom's gonna quit.
Does your head hurt?
I can ski.
What makes you say that?
It's snowing today.
I need you to write Tom a note.
My head hurts today.
She insisted he go to the hospital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think Tom got the fat end of it.
It no longer plays a role.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'll do my homework tomorrow.
Get help.
Tom is suffering from chronic pain.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
I want you to find out if Thomas and Mary are planning on being alone here.
He lives in England.
It's awful down here.
Who wants to talk to me?
What a shock!
We tried to stop Tom.
To love and be loved is the greatest happiness.
Fuck you.
Guilty as charged.
Who wants to talk to me?
Get some backup.
He was two years younger than me.
We just got here today.
Come stay with me.
Bring me her head.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I didn't think you'd want that.
>>bos_Latn<< When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least 6 different jobs.
You're embarrassing him.
>>bos_Latn<< Due to her physical shortcomings, Mary uses a walking stick when she is outside.
You can just tell us the truth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The office door is yellow.
I think Tom needs help.
I'm not usually in the office on Mondays.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Lemon contains citric acid.
We'll never catch Tom.
I have a lot of friends.
The crown was so beautiful.
I destroyed the school.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
We'll stop it.

I could go there now.
I should have waited for Tom to wake up.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Have fun while you can.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
We're of the same breed.
What's up, Tom?
Tom's going through a midlife crisis.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
You bastard!
Stop talking.
I can't forget that.
Who's knocking on the door?
I've been waiting.
Whose handwriting is this?
Be yourself.
This money will really help.
Think about death.
Everything is equal before the law.
From the moment he saw him, his heart stopped.
I don't understand the problem.
You must be new here.
Please, come.
Tom smashed the window.
Is breakfast included in the price?
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Just give Tom a second.
I'm used to it.
Tell Tom to do better.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
I already ordered it.
I shouldn't have rushed it.
Check it out.
Are you done washing dishes?
I always thought it was weird.
The ring is tight.
All we know is that Tom is guilty.
She abandoned her children.
Thank you very much. You should also feel free and ask for help in the future.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Tom wasn't acting like a normal boy.
>>bos_Latn<< Several newspapers published the story.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom bowed his head.
We have therefore set up a small portable cabin that can be divided into two parts and can be driven anywhere.
Everything will be all right in the end. If it's not all right, then it's not even the end.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to stay the night.
Let's get acquainted!
Are you done yet?
It's a disadvantage to be ugly.
That can't be true.
Tom has a great memory.
Please don't say that.
Let's go to the movies.
Is it yours?
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about that.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Stay calm.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad weather didn't let me go.
Tom hired a private investigator to follow Mary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The proposal was wonderful.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
Does she like my hat?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
My French is still not that good.
Can't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
We're never going back there.
No one knows what she's become.
Fish is good for you.
They know you.
I can't.
I've been asleep since ten o'clock in the evening.
I could have killed you, but I didn't.
Hey.
What are you gonna do this summer?
He put his thoughts on paper.
I'm a rookie.
I'm used to it.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
I didn't participate in the conversation.
Tom got on the bus.
You've been very quiet.
With freedom comes responsibility.
Get him.
Let's go.
What's your favorite kind of sushi?
Come see me after work.
How did I miss this?
That boy talks like an adult.
You're staring at the TV again instead of doing your homework!
Cows eat grass.
I need a haircut.
He redeemed himself for his mistakes.
I think I'll be back in about thirty minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on an island?
Nobody cares why Tom is a vegetarian.
Tom's pretty mysterious.
Did you eat anything?
Tom's easy to scare.
I'll try everything sometime.
Tom taught me how to read.
There's a math test tomorrow.
Don't let him get away with this.
Laughter is contagious.
They sell fish and meat.
That's exactly what happened.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
We better get ready.
I'm falling for her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm sorry, the connection is still busy.
Tom just told me the opposite.
He has one son and two daughters.
Here's your bag.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said cannot be applied to this situation.
There are several reasons.
What are you going to do from now on?
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I like grapes.
What do you have to do?
It didn't matter to me.
He's back from Canada.
>>srp_Cyrl<< "You talk too much," he said.
I'm really happy about that.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of it.
They'll know what to do.
We failed.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
I feel fine now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
Are you saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't buy it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about the plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
Tom can't play guitar.
He looks young for his age.
I don't know why my head hurts.
Let's do someone a favor.
I will always remember your advice.
He cheated on the biology exam.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Tom is crazy about Maria.
With that money he inherited from his grandfather, he bought an engagement ring for Mary.
Who are you trying to fool?
Take care of yourself.
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Layla immediately began to cry.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
Learning all of these sentences by heart is out of the question.
What have you done now?
I'm sure you can do it.
You can't go in that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
Tom decided to sell the car.
Who are you?
>>bos_Latn<< There has been a new snow avalanche on the road in Echeskaret in Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday evening and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
Are you Uyghur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car on my own.
Open up!
Please hurry.
Tom nodded his head.
Should we tell someone?
He's flooded with cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
Don't be mad.
>>bos_Latn<< His memory loss is more a mental than a physical problem.
He died.
He started yelling.
As it came, so it went.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom could have been better.
She lives a happy life with her husband near the sea in Kamakura.
Tom's getting fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if it's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't fight back.
Do you speak Greek?
It meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Fish, please.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about that,
Tom talked about music.
Everything has its price.
It was warm yesterday.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
Are you Uyghur?
Curiosity killed the cat.
Why do people go to the movies?
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary get along well.
When can Tom come home?
Did you do it on purpose?
I see a reflection of my face in the window glass.
Go talk to Tom.
Make up your mind.
There's no use trying to talk him into it.
I was thinking about my family.
You could have saved me coming here if you'd just told me I wasn't supposed to be here today.
This will make it a lot easier for us psao.
How's the weather in New York?
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's get over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the board on the toilet.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Start now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I have no intention of answering any questions.
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours nonstop.
This one's pretty cool.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That publishing company is solvent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pick one.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
Tom will probably still be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm too old for this.
I'm not falling for it.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we ever see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
I want my dream to come true.
He thought he was a monster.

I just got here.
I went to church this morning.
Which eye hurts?

Why should I listen to you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was never brave to happen.
I'm gonna quit school.
How old are you?
What kind of movie is this?
Did I drop that?
Turn right.
It would take forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked in many years.
What a beautiful house!
I haven't forgotten him.
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?

I'm not at all worried.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all this.
Will you do that for me?
I probably won't watch this.
Stop worrying.
Come in.
Did I call you?

When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
Neither can I.
I was nine years old when I asked my mom if Santa really existed.
Do you like roller coasters?
Everything will be fine in the end. If it's not fine, then it's not the end.
I'm angry.
Follow him.
Let's move, people.
Are you being sarcastic?
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
Some people, no matter what age they are, do not lose their beauty.
We shouldn't make fun of others.
Tom went to the beach.
Did you make a full recovery?
Smoking kills.
I'm proud of that.
Where did I leave my keys?
There is an obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
You're a very patient teacher.
The elephant has a long nose.
I asked my boss for a raise.
Am I ever wrong?
It's not a crime to skip breakfast sometimes.
Mind your own business!
She licked the spoon.
What do you got?
We know that's not true.
She picked up some pretty rocks.
We're all gonna die.
Tom has two children.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to smile and endure.
Cigarettes cost two marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
This is how it's supposed to be.
Tom got nervous because of you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I have your dictionary?
Tom ate the whole box of chocolates himself.
Keep the change.
Can we do this later?
I like to study foreign languages.
The truth must be told.
Wash up.
Do you like costumes?
Haven't you done enough?
What do you know about me?
I think Tom's very smart.
We have two daughters and two sons.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it in plain words.
In our monogamous part of the world, getting married means halving your rights and doubling your obligations.
Tom only drinks decaf.
There's a cat in the kitchen.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
We should get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom sleeps all the time.
I really like your music.
Let me sit down.
This is Copacabana!
The language of Europe is translation.
I'm learning a few languages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mayor personally presented the awards.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
I would do it again without thinking.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen to my instructions carefully.
Do you have any idea about my life?
Tired of reading.
Can we order now?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The code is "Muriel".
We can't stop here.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom didn't even for a moment think of trying to convince Mary to do it.
Don't argue with me.
Hey, give me a chance.
>>bos_Latn<< There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Several people were killed.
Who is this madman?
Do you love your mother?
He is a complete monarch.
Who is this man?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
He likes to make a donkey out of a gnat.
I totally disagree with that.
The boy's skinny.
It's a routine thing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He never got over the death of his son.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
Nothing works for me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
My children need me.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it was too little.
Of course, Tom's wrong.
I didn't wash my hair.
I can also close my eyes.
He has to buy his son a new bike.
My dear, do not be shy!
Are you afraid of death?
Are you hungry?
Tom is still frustrated.
If you try, you will succeed.
We have enough seats for everyone.
It was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get lice.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
What did you say?
I don't know the answer.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
This ad is very offensive.
I want Tom gone by noon.
Tom looked stunned.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
It won't help if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
A cat is not a man!
So this is how it ends?
What is this?
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
That doesn't like me.
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
I might not sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
Magdalen is interested in geography.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No. What's the matter?"
That's what both of them like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
There's no reason to be scared.
Turn around.
The pen I'm writing belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
Just close your eyes.
Mary lost her key.
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
That's great!
How do you know so much?
Tom smothered the smile.
I picked up my luggage.
I'm scared.
What name?
Take it easy!
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
>>bos_Latn<< It is an area with lots of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
What do you think of when you hear the word "radioactivity"?
Tom likes sports.
I hate you from the bottom of my heart.
Tell him.
Tom took his wig off.
Do you want to learn something specific?
It just so happens I'm right.
Time has no end, it's endless.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Tom's not here.
We're gonna have to walk now.
Don't go near my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I even tried.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pizza girl and Mr. porridge were walking in the woods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Either way, you're wrong.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The redheads are driving me crazy!
I'm not bitter at all.
Man has many desires that he does not really want to be realized, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such one desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it had been fulfilled, man would have become completely sick of infinite life, and would have wanted death.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
Yumi is one of my friends.
It amazes me.
He just needed a little time.
I didn't think Tom would do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Mary began to undress.
As above, so below.
Life without love has no meaning.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm firmly against this.
>>bos_Latn<< The tailor cuts and the cook bakes.
You underestimate me.
The company plans to expand to China.
He devoted his entire life to the study of physics.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes in French.
He's a good person.
She kissed her fingers on the table.

The first step is always the hardest.
This was on the list.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We're Australians.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
Hard work paid off.
Is it yours?
Tom asked me if he should help Mary or not.
I already knew the truth.
The Greeks often eat fish.
I was just thinking about you.
>>bos_Latn<< The signal lights are used to transmit Morse code.
I didn't know.
It doesn't go beyond Main Street, but you can catch number 31 from there.
The worst is yet to come.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
A lot of people already hate you.
If I'd known your e-mail address, I'd have texted you.
The temperature here is higher than in Tokyo.
Tom could beat up anyone.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
I'm doing the best I can here.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
The war costs $2,000 million a month.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
The government has fallen.
I can't help it.
This is today's paper.
Tom took a sip of wine.
This is going to take forever.
Tom has to follow our rules.
None of the students knew the answer to the question.
My leg!
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
You'll be famous.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I totally disagree with you.
Back off.
My new shoes are made of leather.
It was really inspiring.
Let me do that again.
They live there.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Please write that.
>>bos_Latn<< This book will help you write effectively.
Is this seat taken?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mary lives off sewing.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
It had a very different effect than intended.
We played on the beach.
I was surprised by Tom’s response.
Have a little patience with what you're doing.
Everybody laughs.
Can you come?
I loved going to the beach.
Is breakfast included in the price?
YouTube videos are pointless.
The man was eating bread.
Where's your father?
I was just thinking about you.
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
The Second World War began in 1939.
I'd agree.
It all stopped.
Can you recommend a hotel near the airport?
He's my friend.
The book is sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
How you doing?
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
He's a heroin addict.
People need to stop hating.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He raised the trophy high.
I have no doubt he will succeed.
It's his, isn't it?
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.

They fooled everyone.
The woman eats bread.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
The weather is so nice!
I don't think your plan is realistic.

Everybody loves that place.
Do we have one of those?
How do you put that together?
We don't get along well with our neighbors.
Do you like to write?
They decided to get married.
What's Tom drinking?
Exercising has many benefits.
That's what the scholars are arguing about.
He's trying.
French is a difficult language.
Be reasonable.
If you showed up now and said something like that, it would just add fuel to the fire.
Tom told me his father passed away.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be sweeter.
Don't get caught.

We're from France.

You're not the one who died.
What time is it today?
It's hard to imagine.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
We got up at dawn.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom put down his drink.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
Space is empty.
Tom decided against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't have done this without your help.
Don't answer that.
Tom's gonna buy a new computer.
If you would do that for me, it would be very helpful.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Tom might be honest.
At first glance, it seems easy.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried now.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm totally broke.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a minute?
I think Tom could do it.
Don't let it get to your head.
My right arm is numb.
That's enough!
I sell coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!

I liked that one.
You don't even know his name, do you?
>>bos_Latn<< Al lived in the Soviet Union, that great and multi-ethnic one, in the great Tver region, in size equal to several English countries.

You have good instincts.
I thought I did a good job.
These plates are hand-painted.

I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
Can you tell the difference between silver and tin?
They know you.
She stopped talking.
Death is like a dream.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
I could talk to Tom.
Are you sure?
Do you have a passport?
Do you believe in God?
My brother's not home.
We kissed last night.
One swallow does not make a spring.
Was I really that happy?
>>srp_Cyrl<< We act impartially.
My mother loves music.
Tom never had to do that.
>>bos_Latn<< You don't often hear that someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
I need coffee in the morning.
Why are we even discussing this?
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
They made love all night.
That's what both of them like.
Something's come up.
You're watching AnnoZero, eh?
Who painted this picture?
Police, police, help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom will miss me very much.
What's your name?
We enjoyed singing together.
Where did you get that?

We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
You know your rights.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
I'm stunned.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
What's your Bosnian name?
I have a plan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thinking is very necessary.
You've taken my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to go camping with us next weekend?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
What's your friend's name?
Drive safe.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People tell me things.
Cheers!
>>bos_Latn<< This bronze statue is covered with patina.
Tom's in his pajamas.
That's new.

I have a lot of friends.
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
Can I talk to you in private?
It's hard.
This whiskey is very strong.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's that going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom is also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give anything to make sure that didn't happen.

They're all standing.
Do you believe in eternal life?
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
By the end of June, they were ready to vote.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
A piece of shit can never be gilded so it doesn't smell.
Don't rush it.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
I'm a student.
Hello, how are you?
Are my ears red?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Is the cat in the chair or under the chair?
>>bos_Latn<< Employees may be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and chances of advancement.
>>bos_Latn<< Education in this world disappoints me.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Every day read something that no one else is reading. Every day thinks something that no one else is thinking. Every day do something that no one else would be crazy to do. It is bad for the spirit to always be balanced.
Why are you so smart?
He avoided danger.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mayuko had a strange dream.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get your driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Did you do it intentionally?
Is everything settled now?
>>bos_Latn<< How can it be that mathematics, which is after all only the product of human thought independent of experience, is so astonishingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
We weren't careful enough.
They armed themselves with guns.
Write something.
Did you bring coffee?
Tom seems to be an honest person.

I'm always grumpy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom teaches French.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I have always loved horror films.
Chances are it will rain tomorrow.
Something just came up.
I can't get over it.
You sound like you're not having fun.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've gained weight.
Works for me.
They're not mine.
I fell to the ground.
I'll be late.
I'm doubling the prices.
Could you do that?
There are also cats on Mars.
I didn't vote for Tom.
I called him.
>>bos_Latn<< A video recording of the interview was made and was published throughout the Internet.
You need money.
Tom was drunk and drowned his sorrow, after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we take a break?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
Some people like to travel alone.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
You're the boss.
Someone's here.
I guess we'll never see each other again.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do that either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
I watched Tom die.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
Such is life!
How did I get here?
Why not?
He rarely gives up.
I've been looking for you.
Tom let out a muffled sigh.
You should have known that.
There's a lot of work I have to do before I can go home.
It's snowing today.
Money is not a measure of success.
He dared to ignore my advice.
Girls do.
By the way, where do you live?
It seems to be a pretty big museum.
Any questions?
We gave in to their demands.
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Everything else is irrelevant.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do I feel sarcasm?
It's almost half past three.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Let's just check it out.
Zurich is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you do any sports?
We weren't careful enough.
Are you okay?
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get carried away.
I've been to more than ten foreign countries so far.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
People have short memories.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a tough job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
My mother was furious.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I'm feeling worse."
Are they friends?
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories live on.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Which is easier?
Did you do the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that spilled a glass.
He doesn't like us.
Please, go on.
This could hurt.
It would have saved us time if we'd climbed down Park Street.
A police officer arrested him for drunk driving.
We're gonna be crazy.
Tom's seeing things.
Tom's always dreaming.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
Why did you shave your beard?
That gave Tom an idea.
I got lucky.
Trains in Serbia are extremely slow.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
They lived happily ever after.
This time it leads to the city.
Your time will come soon.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Because they are made in Italy, these jeans are very expensive.
>>bos_Latn<< Run over any obstacle with this monster of a truck!
We went to see turtles on the beach.
Mary spends a lot of time on her phone, texting and e-mailing friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Luck was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
Tom says he wants to change.
What's this about?
I want to help you.
We're not going back to Boston.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children all their lives.
We're close friends.
Mary hasn't baked the meat yet.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
You can go to sleep now.
Why do you ask?
It's big.
It's mine, not his.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It turned out to be true.
As fast as it is, it's short.
Can you take me to her?
Where were you born?
Come sit next to me.
Three sizes, cut once.
I found him a book.
I could barely hide my indignation at her insolence.
Butter is made from milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
He can't come because he's sick.
It's getting better.
You want to see something specific?
That's not the real problem.
I miss her.
I don't know the answer.
I passed the exam!
It's really hot.
Let's start now.
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please, don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
Who is your teacher?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
No one's working, everyone's watching the World Cup.
I'm still a little tired.
What's your blood type?
