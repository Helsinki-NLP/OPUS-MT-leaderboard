“According to our knowledge, there is only one planetary body that shows greater dynamics than Titan, and that is the Earth,” Stofan added.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The problem began on January 1 when dozens of local residents began complaining to the postal service in Obanazawa, as they had not received their traditional and regular New Year's greetings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The post office apologized to citizens and in the media yesterday after discovering that the boy had hidden over 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year's cards, that were not delivered to intended recipients.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The unmanned Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter ejected its Lunar Impact Probe (MIS) which was speeding at 1.5 kilometers per second (3000 miles per hour), and successfully crashed near the Moon's south pole.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to three important scientific instruments, the lunar probe also carried a picture of the national flag of India, painted on all sides.
“Thank you to those who supported a convict like me, Siriporn said at a press conference.
“There may be those who disagree, but I don’t care.
I am happy that there are people who are willing to support me.
Since Pakistan's independence from British rule in 1947, the Pakistani president has appointed "political agents" to govern the FATA area, and they have almost complete self-rule over the areas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These agents are responsible for providing services to the government and the judiciary under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hostel collapsed in Mecca, a holy Islamic city, at approximately 10 a.m. this morning local time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were a lot of pilgrims staying in the building who came to visit the holy city on the eve of the Hajj.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The guests of the hostel were mostly from the United Arab Emirates.
The death toll is at least 15, and is expected to rise further.
Leonov, also known as "Cosmonaut No. 11", was part of the original Soviet team of cosmonauts.
On 18 March 1965, he performed the first manned flight into open space (EVA), or "spacewalk", and was left alone outside the spacecraft for just over twelve minutes.
For his work, he received the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, the highest decoration of the Soviet Union.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 10 years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission which symbolically marked the end of the space race.
She said: "There is no information to suggest that an attack is imminent."
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, reducing the level of danger to serious does not mean that the general danger has disappeared."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although authorities have not confirmed the authenticity of the threat, the Maryland Transportation Authority made the decision to close in consultation with the FBI.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cypers were used to block the entrance to the tunnel, and assistance from 80 police officers was provided to direct the drivers to the bypass roads.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No major slowdowns in traffic were reported on the roundabout, an alternative city road.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nigeria has previously announced that it plans to join the African CFTA in the week before the summit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< AU Commissioner for Trade and Industry, Albert Muchanga, announced that Benin would join.
The Commissioner said: "We have not yet agreed on the rules of origin and tariff relief, but the framework we have is enough to start trading on 1 July 2020."
>>srp_Cyrl<< The station did not change its behavior until the end of the spacewalk, despite the loss of the gyroscope in the previous space mission.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chiao and Sharipov reported that they were at a safe distance from the thruster to adjust the movement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Russian flight control activated the jet engines and the normal position of the station was re-established.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The case was prosecuted in Virginia because it is where the leading Internet service provider AOL, the company that launched the charges, is located.
This is the first time that a ruling has been made using a law that came into force in 2003, which curbs the accumulation of email boxes, known as spam, by unwanted distributors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Twenty-one-year-old Jesus joined Manchester City in January last, 2017 from Brazilian club Palmeiras for an alleged sum of 27 million pounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since then, the Brazilian has performed for the club in 53 matches in all competitions and scored 24 goals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr Lee also expressed concern about reports of children in Turkey who are now infected with the Avian Flu A(H5N1) virus and are not sick at the same time.
He said some research suggests the disease would have to become less deadly before it could cause a global epidemic.
There is concern that patients could infect more people when performing their daily routines if flu symptoms remain mild.
Leslie Aoun, a spokesman for the Komen Foundation, said the organization had adopted a new rule that does not allow the allocation of funds or funding to organizations that are under legal investigation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Comena's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood for an unresolved investigation, into how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money, conducted by advocate Cliff Stearns.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stearns, in his role as Chair in the Subcommittee on Oversight and Research which is under the Energy and Commerce Committee, is investigating whether the tax is being used to fund abortion through Planned Parenthood.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won the first Republican Party presidential election in Florida, on Tuesday, with over 46 percent of the vote.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich finished in second place with 32 percent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the winner-takes-all state, Florida assigned Romney all fifty delegates, pushing him forward as the first nominee for the Republican Party nomination.
Organisers of the protest said about 100,000 people had gathered in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
Police estimated that there were 6,500 protesters in Berlin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, around 200 people protested against the offices of the big copyright owners.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last month, there were major protests in Poland when that country signed the ACTA agreement, leading the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining ACTA.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras for video surveillance in all Australian slaughterhouses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< David Oshenesy, Chief Inspector of the RSPCA (Royal Association for the Prevention of Violence against Animals) of New South Wales told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be common in Australia.
“CCCTV would certainly send a strong signal to those who work with animals that their welfare is their top priority.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were no earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week on the international earthquake map of the United States Geological Topographic Institute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Icelandic Meteorological Institute has not reported any seismological activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Significant earthquake activity due to the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeastern part of the caldera at the top of the volcano.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dark clouds have been reported to exist at the foot of the mountain that have nothing to do with any volcanic activity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Clouds created a possibility of confusion as to whether there was actually an eruption.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The moon contained 120-160 cubic metres of fuel when it broke, and strong winds and waves pushed it onto the breakwater.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Helicopters rescued those twelve crew members and the only injury was a broken nose.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 100-foot ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and initially officials feared the vessel might spill cargo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both houses had already approved the proposed amendment in 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The amendment came at this legislative session, when the House of Representatives first deleted the second sentence, to be passed by the Senate on Monday in a similar form.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A random exception to the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could open up the possibility of assembling civil communities in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Following the process, HJR-3 will consider the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016 to remain in effect.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Among Votti's achievements outside the realm of directing is the 1973 hunger strike, which was aimed against political censorship.
His activism began when he was 15 years old, when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He wrote about himself in a 1998 book.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the 1960s, he returned to teach film directing in Algeria, which had just achieved independence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Japanese judo player Hitoshi Saito, the winner of two Olympic medals, has died at the age of 54.
Cancer of the intrahepatic bile duct is listed as the cause of death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He died Tuesday in Osaka.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to being a former Olympic and world champion, Saito was also chairman of the All-Japanese Judo Federation Training Committee at the time of his death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least a hundred people were at a party to celebrate the first anniversary of the couple who got married last year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Celebrating the anniversary is scheduled for a later term, officials said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate the wedding with friends and relatives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Carnot is a well-known but controversial professor of English who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory educational centers and who claimed the number of his students reached 9,000 in the most successful period of his career.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In his notes, he used words that some parents found rude, and they say he also used ugly words in class.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Modern education accused him of printing large advertising ads on buses without approval and of lying, saying he was the head teacher of English.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was also previously charged with copyright infringement, but no lawsuit was filed against him.
A former student said he “used slang in class, taught entertainment skills in notes, and was like a student’s friend.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Over the last three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The first economic reforms were implemented under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economic size has grown by 90 times.
For the first time, China exported more cars than Germany last year and surpassed the United States as the industry’s largest market.
China’s GDP could be higher than America’s in two decades.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tropical Storm Daniel, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, originated in the eastern part of the Atlantic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, maintains maximum wind speeds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists from the National Hurricane Center predict that Daniel will grow into a hurricane by Wednesday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, Bobek gained fame playing for Partizan from Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During his engagement on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No one has ever made more appearances and made more goals for the club than Bobek.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was named the best player in Partizan history in 1995.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The celebrations began with a special point of the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janjichar Military Band and singers Fatih Erkoch and Muslum Gurses followed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then the Mewlevi (turning dervishes) came out onto the scene.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Turkish diva Sezen Aksu had a performance with Italian tenor Alessandro Safin and Greek singer Haris Alexiouum.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia performed the dance act “Troy”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle driver, died after taking part in a collision at the motor racing track in Indianapolis.
>>srp_Cyrl<< While driving a warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, and was then hit by fellow runner Xavier Zayat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Immediately the medical staff on the track assisted him, and he was transported to a local hospital where he later died.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Zayat was unharmed in the accident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to state that “the financial system is part of the economy, its key part.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have a one-year financial crisis, which has had its peak in the past two months, and I think the financial markets are starting to recover now."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last week, the Necked News website announced it would dramatically increase the range of news broadcasts in foreign languages, with three new broadcasts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The global organization already reporting in English and Japanese, is launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the Internet and mobile devices.
“Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a morbid scene of people trying to break windows to get out.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People hit the window panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
“One glass finally broke and people began to come out the window,” said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stars emit light and heat due to the energy that is created when hydrogen atoms fuse together (fusion) and form heavier elements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is, however, a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years until we see the construction of useful fusion reactors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A steel needle floats on water due to surface tension.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface of the water attract each other strongly, more than is the case with the air molecules above them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Water molecules make an invisible cuticle on the surface, which allows things like a needle to float on the water.
The modern skate skater has a double edge with a recessed cavity between them. The two edges allow for better ice grip, even when tilted.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, while the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curved.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This allows skaters to turn. If the skate is tilted to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skate is tilted to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To get back to their previous energy level, they have to get rid of the excess energy they received from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a photon.
Scientists call this process “stimulated radiation emission” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes photons of light to be emitted, and light is a type of radiation.
In the following image, the atoms that emit photons are shown. Of course, in reality, photons are much smaller than those in the image.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Photons are smaller even than the things that make up atoms!
>>srp_Cyrl<< After hundreds of hours of operation the bulb's fiber eventually burns out and the bulb no longer works.
The bulb should then be replaced. It is necessary to be careful when replacing the bulb.
First you need to turn off the light switch or pull out the cable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is because the current flowing into the bulb's throat, where its metal part is located, can give you a strong electric shock if you touch the inside of the throat or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in the throat.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood moves from the heart further in the tubes called arteries, and returns to the heart with tubes called veins. At least the tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops teeth could crush not only the leaves, but even very tough branches and roots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some scientists think that triceratops ate cicadas, which are a species of plant that was widespread during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, pointed leaves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Triceratops may have used its powerful beak to take off the leaves before eating the tree.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so they are unlikely to have been eaten by any dinosaur, although today sloths and other animals like parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
What effect would the gravity of the Iya satellite have on me? If you stood on the surface of Iya, you would have less weight than on Earth.
A person who on Earth weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Iya would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg). So, of course, gravity pulls you weaker.
The Sun has no crust like Earth, on which you can stand. The whole Sun is composed of gases, fire and plasma.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The gas is getting rarer the further away you are from the center of the Sun.
The outer part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means “ball of light.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Approximately three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to notice that Venus had me, just like the Moon.
I happen because only that side of Venus (or the Moon) that faces the Sun is illuminated. Venus’s me supported Copernicus’ theory that planets revolve around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks noticed the transit of Venus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< England experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of Dannelag.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since the time of Guthrum a century before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This fleet was led by Olaf Trigwasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to liberate his country from Danish domination.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After initial military obstacles Ethelred was able to make a deal with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to regain his kingdom with variable success.
Hangul is the only purposely invented alphabet used in popular use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
>>srp_Cyrl<< King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joson dynasty and is one of the most respected.
He originally called the Hangul alphabet Hunminjeongeum, which translates to "correct voices to teach people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came to be. One of them is about the migration of Aryans from the west to India, who then brought their own language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to Latin, which was used in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit only faded due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, from which many modern Indian languages have developed, just as Latin was the basis for European languages such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the Battle of France, Germany began to prepare for an invasion of the island of Britain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Germany gave the attack the codename "Operation Sea Lion".Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost when evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was rather weak.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriggsmarine") and could have destroyed any attack fleet that would have been sent via the English Channel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, very few Royal Navy ships were located near likely conquest routes, as the admirals feared they would be sunk by a German attack from the air.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mostly the "younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their army and navy were weaker, although they had just built four (4) new ships just before the start of the war.
The main goals of Italy were African countries. To conquer those countries, they would have to have a base for launching troops, so that troops could sail the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
As a result, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian battleships were not allowed to do anything else.
And now as far as Japan is concerned, Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Submarines are vessels designed to travel underwater and stay there for an extended period of time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. They were extremely slow at the time and had a fairly limited firing range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but as the radar began to develop and become more accurate, the submarines were forced to go underwater so as not to be detected.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and managing their submarines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to their success with submarines, after the war the Germans were not given many of the same in possession.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as “King Tut” or “Boy King”, is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, it was not considered particularly important in ancient times and is not recorded on most ancient royal lists.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 turned him into a star. While many tombs from the past were looted, this tomb remained virtually intact.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the items buried alongside Tutankhamun are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The invention of the gear wheel allowed Assyrian chariots to become easier, faster, and more willing to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Arrows from their deadly crossbows could pierce the armor of rival soldiers. circa 1000 BC The Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
Cavalry is an army that fights on horses. The saddle was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of the horse.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous person from this culture is Homer, a legendary blind poet, who compiled two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems to the Iliad and Odyssey.
The popularity of the playwrights Sophocles and Aristophanes still continues, and their plays are among the most important works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, mainly known for his famous theorem on the relations of sides of right triangles.
There are different estimates about how many people speak the Hindu language. It is estimated that by the number of speakers in the world it is somewhere between second and fourth place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The number of source speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million people who speak, and as many as 800 million people who can understand this language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, but differ in writing; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native population, so they invented the Estonian literary language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was based on the German alphabet and a single character was added to the "?/?".
As time went on, many words borrowed from German came together. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the army after finishing school.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Charles went to Trinity University at Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, and so earned 2:2 (second class lower degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a degree.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) makes up 3% of the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The territory of Turkey is longer than 1600 kilometres (1,000 miles) and wider than 800 kilometres (500 mi), and is roughly rectangular in shape.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The area of Turkey, including the lakes, occupies an area of 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) is located in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and roughly the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by the sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Today's parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past, but after the Belgian Revolution of 1830 they became Belgian.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral state, but during World War I and World War II it was occupied by Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founders of the organization now known as the European Union.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Drukyal Jong is a ruin of a fortress and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro County (in the village of Fondi).
>>srp_Cyrl<< They say that in 1649 Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal made a fortress in memory of his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to the 1951 fire, only some of Drukgyal Jong's relics have been preserved, such as a painting by Frogdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected, and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the 18th century, Cambodia found itself narrowly between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the grey economy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the Venezuelans who work, two-thirds work in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry, and a fifth in agriculture.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, of which this country is a net exporter, although only one percent of people work in the oil industry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the early years of the nation's independence, the expertise of the Singapore Botanical Garden helped transform this island into a tropical Garden City.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wanda Miss Joachim, orchid hybrid, was selected as a national flower in 1981.
Each year during the October period, nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel to the southern lowlands, crossing the Maru River, from the northern hills due to rain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And then back north across the west, again crossing the Mara River, after raining roughly in April.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Serengeti region consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Reserve and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes ("storiboarding", audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires that parts of the project be connected to each other, but also make sense as separate entities.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths are much greater than in ordinary lenses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This becomes an increasingly minor problem as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in their production.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This allowed zoom lenses to create images that can be compared in quality to those achieved with a fixed-wire distance lens.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Because of this, cheap zoom lenses are difficult to use without flashing in conditions when the light is weak.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Overscan is one of the most common problems that occurs when you want to convert a film to DVD format.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most television is made in a way that will please a wide audience.
For this reason, everything you see on TV has cut edges at the top, bottom and sides.
This is done in order to display the image across the screen. This is called "screen edge correction".
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably also be cut, and if the video has subtitles that are too close to the bottom of the edge, it will not be seen completely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The traditional medieval castle has long evoked imagination, calling up images of knightly struggles, feasting, and arturian chivalry.
Even standing in the midst of a thousand-year-old ruins, it’s easy to recall the sounds and smells of long-drawn-out battles, almost hear the hooves rattling across the cobblestones, and smell the fear rising from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are castles built in the first place? How are they designed and built?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Typical of this period, Kirby Maxlow Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls could not resist a decisive attack for long.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When Lord Hastings began its construction in the 1480s, the land was relatively peaceful and defence was only needed from small gangs of wandering raiders.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The balance of power was the system by which European nations attempted to maintain the sovereignty of all European states.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The concept was such that all European nations had to try to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and therefore national governments often changed their allies to maintain balance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war where the main problem was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, given that the European powers no longer had the excuse that these were religious wars. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war to be designated as a religious war.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Artemis' temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in a fire set by Herostratus.
According to tradition, he was motivated by fame at all costs. The bitter Ephesians ordered that the name of Herostratus should never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded this name, and this is why it is known to us today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, in his capacity as king, offered to finance the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was not accepted. After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Relax your hand as much as possible, trying to still correctly guess all the notes - also, try to minimize unnecessary finger movements.
In this way, you will tire yourself as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to press the dirke with great power to get the extra volume, such as that on the piano.
To get the extra volume on the harmonica, use bellows with more pressure or speed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mysticism is the search for an intimate connection, identity with, or awareness of the ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or insight into a divine reality/deity or deity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Followers follow a certain way of living or customs that aim to cultivate those experiences.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship, in that it focuses on direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially in those of a calm, discerning, blissful or even sewn-up character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century due to a sectarian division within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their religion to be a separate religion from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that it has Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the way of the guru". The guru is the basic aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has a meaning that is the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539) in the 15th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were tested, when unrest in Poland, whose workers went out to demonstrations dissatisfied with food shortages and income cuts, grew into massive anti-communist protests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although eventually Khrushchev sent tanks to establish order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Gomulka as the new prime minister.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent that covers most of present-day Pakistan and some regions of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Civilization flourished in the Indus River basins, after which it was named.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although some scientists speculate that since civilization also existed in the basins of the now-drought Saraswati River, it should properly be called the Indus and Saraswati civilizations, while some call it Harappa civilization, according to Harappi, the first of the sites that were excavated in the 1920s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The militant nature of the Roman Empire was instrumental in the development of medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began by hiring doctors, who even established the first Roman medical corps for post-battle treatment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives, such as morphine obtained from poppy seeds and scopolamine from the seed of the well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They became skilled at amputation to save patients from gangrene, as well as using clamps and arterial pliers to stop blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire made great advances in the field of medicine, which greatly contributed to the knowledge we possess today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The puerland origami is an origami where there is a limit that only one fold can be performed at a time, more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all bends have predetermined locations.
It was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to make the process easier for inexperienced "benders" or people with reduced motor skills.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite early on and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school often do not fare well in school after hearing about this stereotype that exists for their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in an educational context.
There are also positive aspects to these websites, which include the ability to easily set up a class page where you can find blogs, videos, images, and other add-ons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This page can be easily accessed by giving only one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type to students who may have problems using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be adjusted to make reading easier and also with as little or as much color as you want.
Attention Deficit Disorder is “a neurological syndrome that generally defines three symptoms, including impulsivity, absent-mindedness, and hyperactivity or excess energy.”
It’s not a learning disability, it’s a learning disorder; it “affects between 3 and 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Children with attention disorder find it difficult to focus on things such as homework, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy, such as playing games or watching a favorite cartoon or writing sentences without spelling signs.
These children often get into big trouble because they “get into risky behaviors, fight and challenge authority” to stimulate their brains, because their brains can’t be stimulated by common methods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they behave the way they do or why they write the way they write or that their level of maturity is different.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed in the way mentioned above, the basic rate at which knowledge was acquired was also changed.
The approach to adopting information was different. The pressure was no longer on the individual recall, but a greater focus was placed on the ability to memorize text.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Essentially, the Renaissance brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, carry loads, or wind up trees.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hand and foot of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, which is a reflection of the fact that the hand is used to carry weight when joint walking.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The human hand is shorter than the foot, and has more straight finger (phalange) articles.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fossil arm bones two to three million years old reveal this change in hand specialization from movement to manipulation.
Some people believe that experiencing a lot of artificially induced lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main reason behind this phenomenon is because lucid dreams increase the length of time between REM states.
With fewer REM stages every night, this state where you’re actually experiencing real sleep and your body renewing becomes so rare that it starts to pose a problem.
This is just as tiring as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often at one night your brain tries to lucidly dream.
The Italians in North Africa were not doing well almost from the beginning. Within a week of the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Cavalry Regiment occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and apparent successor to Mussolini, was killed by an error of Italian anti-aircraft artillery on landing in Tobruk.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Modern sport fencing is played at many levels, from students at the university to professionals and competitors at the Olympics.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The sport is primarily played in duel format, one swordsman against the other.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Golf is a game in which players use bats to insert balls into holes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Eighteen holes are played during the regular round, and players usually start at the first hole on the field and finish at eighteen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The winner is the player who receives the fewest strokes at the end of the game or makes the fewest swings with the bat.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called “green”.
Perhaps the most common form of tourism is what people identify with travel: recreational tourism.
This is when people travel to a place that offers something quite different from their daily routine in order to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks, and camping areas are usually the most common places visited by recreational tourists.
If one’s goal is to travel to a particular place to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various sights of a particular country or opt for only one area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The colonists, seeing this activity, also called reinforcements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd Newhampshire Regiments of 200 men, led under Colonels John Stark and James Reid (both later became generals).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stark's men took positions along the fence at the northern end of the colonists' positions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the tide created a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north, which ended at the edge of the water on a small beach.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gridley or Stark set the stake at 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the recruits passed.
The U.S. plan was based on conducting coordinated attacks from three different directions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< General John Codwolder would launch a diversionary attack on the British garrison at Bordentown to prevent reinforcements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< General James Ewing would take 700 militia members across the river at Trenton Ferry, take the bridge over the Asanpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The main attacking squad of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles from Trenton, and then split into two groups, one led by Green and one led by Sullivan, to carry out the attack before dawn.
By increasing the distance from a quarter to a half mile, speed begins to play a much smaller role, and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first-class runner for a half-mile, a man who can run a track in less than two minutes, must possess quite a bit of speed, but endurance must develop at every opportunity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some running by nature during the winter combined with gymnastics exercises for the upper body is the best preparation for the running season.
The correct habits in the israine can not lead to the best performance on their own, but they can significantly affect the overall condition of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective hydration habits, and understanding the different aspects of supplementing can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of the sport.
Running on medium tracks is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are a lot of misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment you need to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no impact on performance at all.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it does not provide real benefits.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The atom can be considered one of the basic units of the structure of all matter.
It is a very complex whole that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus around which electrons orbit, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive charge while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative charge.
To check the victim, you must first examine the face of the site to ensure your safety.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You must notice the position of the victim as you approach her as well as any automatic warning signs.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, it will only make the situation worse.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Research has shown that depression, fear, and presenting a situation disastrously affect the link between pain and disability in those suffering from lower back pain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only the effects of disaster, not depression and fear were a condition for regular weekly structured physical activity
Those who participated in regular activities required more support, when it came to negative perceptions of pain, distinguishing between chronic pain and a feeling of discomfort from normal physical movement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or the eyes.
There are many different structures of the eye, which vary in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
Different designs have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sensitivity, and also require different processing modes to understand input elements and different numbers to work optimally.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A population is a set of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When all individuals in a population are identical in terms of a particular phenotypic trait, they are known as monomorphic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When individuals show several variants of a particular characteristic, they are polymorphic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The army colony of ants marches and also nests at different stages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the nomadic phase, the ants soldiers march at night, and during the day they take a break and form a camp.
The colony begins its nomadic phase when the available food decreases. During this phase, the colony makes temporary anthills that change every day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These nomadic migrations or marches generally last about 17 days.
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and was first coined by a microscopist who observed the structure of the cork.
A cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and necessary for the study of life, so much so, that they are often called "building blocks of life".
>>srp_Cyrl<< The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep blood flow flowing undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent all over the body so quickly, which helps to protect the body from potential threats.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tornadoes hit small areas compared to other devastating storms, but they can destroy anything that gets in their way.
Tornadoes pluck trees from the roots, tear boards from buildings and lift cars into the sky. Only two percent of tornadoes are the most destructive and last more than three hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind of these monster storms goes up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to allow distant objects to act both closer and larger.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and the nature of cooperation is such that when most benefit, in the short term they will always get more by behaving selfishly.
Hopefully, most people will realize that in the long run, their best option is to work together with others.
Many dream of a day when humans will be able to travel to some other star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what is out there, and some believe that aliens or other forms of life can live on some other planet.
But if this ever actually happens, it probably won't happen for a long time to come. The stars are so far scattered that there are trillions of miles between the stars.
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand in an unknown world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of a large number of cells. They eat things and digest them from the inside. Most animals can move.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only animals have brains (though not all animals; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
There are animals everywhere on the planet, digging on the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism (being).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The word cell comes from the Latin word cella, meaning small room.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you look at living beings under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, observed small squares on the cork using a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe the dead cells
>>srp_Cyrl<< Elements and compounds can be transferred from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. The water compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It has the same molecular structure, whether it be a gas, a liquid, or a solid substance.
Although his physical condition may change, his chemical condition remains the same.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Time is something that is all around us and affects everything we do, and yet it is hard to understand.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Time has been shed for thousands of years by religious, philosophical, and scientific scientists.
We perceive time as a series of events passing from the future through the present and into the past.
With the help of time, we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can record the flow of time yourself by observing the repetition of cyclical events. A cyclical event is something that regularly happens over and over again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Computers are used today to process images and videos.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sophisticated animations can be made on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and film.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted giant birds called mine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The theory then established the thesis that the Maori had migrated from Polynesia by the Grand Fleet and had taken over New Zealand of Morior, creating an agricultural society.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, new evidence suggests that Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, and developed their own special, peaceful culture there.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands; it was the Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They called themselves Moriori, and after several skirmishes, Moriori were wiped off the face of the Earth.
Individuals who have been involved for several decades have helped us appreciate their strengths and passion while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
By listening to how individuals share their individual, family, and organizational stories, we have gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities who have influenced the culture of the organization good or bad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although understanding one's history does not imply understanding of culture, it does help people gain a sense of where their place is in the history of that organization.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As they evaluate successes and become aware of failures, individuals and the entire set of participants discover the values, mission, and driving forces of the organization more deeply.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this case, recalling previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction of the local church.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Such success stories have diminished fear of change, while creating a positive propensity for change in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Convergent thought patterns are problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or areas in order to find solutions.
The focus of this way of thinking is speed, logic and precision, as well as the identification of facts, the re-application of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important factor of this way of thinking is: that there is only one correct answer. Think of only two answers, namely correct or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking think logically, have the ability to memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Humans are by far the most talented species in reading other people's thoughts.
This means that we are able to successfully predict what other people feel, intend, believe, know or want.
Among these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you would probably assume that they were trying to steal someone’s car.
He should be tried differently if he loses his car keys and tries to break into his own car.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The MRT is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloch in 1930 (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves make the atoms emit small radio signals.
Raymond Damadian, a physician and scientific researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, the patent was granted, and it was the first published patent in the field of MRT (Magnetic Resonant Tomography) in the world.
Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole body” MR scanner in 1977, and called it “Neucrotive”.
Asynchronous communication provides time for reflection and reaction to others.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It allows students the opportunity to work at their own pace and to have control over the pace of instruction.
In addition, there are fewer time limits with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
>>srp_Cyrl<< The use of the Internet and the world's communication network allows constant access to information to those who wish to learn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and can expect fairly quick answers, instead of waiting until the next consultation term.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The postmodernist approach to learning propagates freedom from absoluteness. There are more good ways to learn.
In fact, there is not only one good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the interaction between the learner and the knowledge before him.
Our current experience with all that “do it yourself” and presenting information, learning-based television shows make a good point.
So many of us watch television shows that inform us of processes or experiences in which we will never participate, nor will we ever apply that knowledge.
We’ll never repair a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor’s house.
Thanks to underwater fiber-optic cable connections to Europe and a broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population who have internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if you are staying in a boarding house or a private house) are likely to have wireless internet or a computer connected to the internet, and all settlements have an internet cafe or some location with public wireless internet.
As mentioned above, although the word “Eskimo” is still acceptable in the United States, many non-American Arctic peoples, particularly in Canada, find it derogatory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although you can hear that word in the speech of the Greenland natives, foreigners should avoid it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalalex (plural Kalalit), Greenlanders, in Greenland.
Crime and, in general, animosity towards foreigners, practically do not exist in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous areas".
The cold weather may be the only real danger faced by those who are unprepared.
If you’re visiting Greenland during the cold season (considering that the further north you go, the cooler it will be), it’s basic to bring enough warm clothing.
Very long summer days can lead to problems of not getting enough sleep and to all other related health problems.
Pay attention to Nordic mosquitoes during the summer. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can be irritating.
Although the economy of San Francisco is associated with the fact that it is a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diverse.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The largest sectors in terms of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Frequent showings in music, movies, literature, and popular culture helped make the city and its landmarks famous around the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and top-notch convention facilities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< San Francisco is also considered among the people to be one of the best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Taiwanese, Indian, and Japanese.
A trip to Disneyland is a major pilgrimage for many American families.
The “usual” visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to Disney Hotel, a week’s stay there without leaving Disney’s property and returning home.
There are an infinite number of possible variations, but this is still what most people think of when they mention “going to Walt Disney World.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many tickets sold online through auction sites, such as eBay or Craigslist, are partially used multi-day tickets valid for multiple parks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although this is a very common activity, Disney has banned: tickets cannot be transferred to others.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For any camping under the perimeter in the Grand Canyon of Colorado, a permit is required for a field trip in rural regions.
The number of permits is limited to protect the canyon, and they are available on the first day of the month, four months in advance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Therefore, permission to visit the rural end for any date in May becomes available on January 1.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The spaces of the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground, just next to Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with requirements on the very first day they are opened for reservations.
There are a limited number of permits that are reserved for those seeking them on arrival, and which are available under the "first come, first served" principle.
Getting by car to South Africa is a great way to see all the beauty of the region as well as get to places not found on ordinary tourist routes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is feasible with an ordinary car with careful planning, but an all-wheel drive car is especially recommended, and many locations can be accessed exclusively with a vehicle that has a large axle distance and 4x4 drive.
Keep in mind as you plan that while South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are stable.
Visa requirements and its prices vary from country to country and depend on the country you come from.
Each country has unique laws that determine what necessary emergency items you must have in the car.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe, across from Livingston in Zambia and near Botswana.
The town is located right next to the waterfalls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers many opportunities for longer stays for both adventurers and those visiting the sights.
In the rainy season (from November to March) the volume of water will be higher, and the waterfalls more dramatic.
You’re sure to get wet if you cross over a bridge or walk down winding paths by the waterfall.
On the other hand, precisely because the volume of water is so large, you will not be able to see the waterfalls so clearly - because of all that water!
The Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) is perhaps the most famous tomb in the Valley, the site of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the young king's nearly intact royal tomb.
However, compared to many other royal tombs, Tutankhamun’s tomb is almost not worth visiting, as it is much smaller and with limited decorations.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of damage to the mummy that occurred during the attempt to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The underlying treasure of the tomb is no longer located within it, but has been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For visitors who have limited time it would be best to spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom is situated 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hill temple was erected at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasorwaman.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The dark atmosphere in the temple and views of Tonle Sap Lake make the ascent to the hill worth the effort.
A visit to the place can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
A pass to Angkor is required to enter the temple, so don’t forget to bring your passport with you when heading to Tonle Sapa.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, though most other countries, as well as the United Nations, do not recognize it as the Israeli capital.
The fascinating history of this ancient city in the Judean hills goes back thousands of years.
This city is a holy city of three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
The city's religious significance, and especially many places in the Old City area, make Jerusalem one of Israel's major tourist destinations.
Jerusalem has a multitude of historical, archaeological, and cultural attractions, along with lively and crowded shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This letter must be legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, and must meet certain conditions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These requirements were created to allow an organized flow of migration between both countries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cuban citizens who have a green card of the United States should visit the consulate of Ecuador to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of travel. To prove the length of your stay, you need a return/return ticket.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you’re alone or just with one friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people for a better price per person.
However, you really don’t need to worry about this, as tourists often redeploy to fill up cars.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seems to be actually a way to trick people into believing they have to pay more.
>>srp_Cyrl<< High above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises a steep mountain, which is often the background of many photos of the ruins.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It looks a bit scary from below, and the climb is steep and difficult, but most average physically fit people should succeed in about 45 minutes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The stone stairs are placed along the track, and on the steeper parts the steel cables provide a handhold as a support.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is said, expect you to run out of air, and take care in the steeper parts, especially when they are wet, since it can very quickly become dangerous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There is a small cave at the top that must be passed through; it is quite low and narrow.
Wildlife and places on the Galapagos are best seen from the ship, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
Over 60 cruisers sail the waters of the Galapagos - they are of different sizes and receive from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people reserve their seat in advance (since the boats are usually full in the heat of the season).
Check that the agent through whom you book a specialist for Galapagos and with good knowledge of a wide range of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations coincide with the vessel that is most appropriate for them.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mapuche were one of the last independent American indigenous groups, who did not fully assimilate into Spanish-speaking rules until Chile became an independent state.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for several years), a decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Dominican Republic (Spanish: Republica Dominicana) is a Caribbean state that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to beaches with white sand and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first settled by Taini and the Caribbean. The Caribbean were people who spoke the Arawak language, and who arrived on the island around 10,000 BC.
Within a few short years of the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish invaders had significantly reduced the number of Tains.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Judging by Fray Bartolomeo de las Casas ("Tratado de las Indias"), between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish invaders killed about 100,000 Tain.
Garden de la Union. This place was created as a monastery atrium dating from the 17th century, and whose only preserved building is the Temple of St. Diego.
Now it functions as a central square and there is always a lot happening on it, day and night.
There are many restaurants around the garden, and in the afternoon and evening free concerts are held under the central canopy (gazebo).
Kalehon del Beso (The Street of the Kiss). Two balconies between which only 69 centimeters are the place are old love legends.
Your kids will tell you a story.
Bowen Island is popular for a day trip or weekend excursion, and offers kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This authentic community is situated in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver, and can be easily reached by water taxis operating on an established schedule from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trip by the sea to the Sky Corridor is a must.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wisler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but is known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in summer, try authentic mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night at the Siren.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sirena is the only ranger station offering accommodation services and hot meals alongside camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food services.
It is possible to get park tickets directly at the park ranger's station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue park permits more than a month before the scheduled arrival.
>>srp_Cyrl<< CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of US$30, or US$10 for one-day passes; details are on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island nation that is in free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is an archipelago with fifteen (15) islands spread over 2.2 million km2 of oceans.
Being in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered "New Zealand Hawaiians".
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although smaller, they remind some older visitors to Hawaii of a time before statehood, a time without major tourist hotels and other development facilities.
There are no cities on the Cook Islands, but they are made up of 15 different islands. The most significant are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the provision of deluxe bed and breakfast services is raised almost to the level of art.
The best facilities that provide bed and breakfasts certainly compete mainly in two main things: bed and breakfast.
Therefore, in the best facilities of this kind can be found the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a hand-made quilt or an antique bed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Breakfast can include seasonal treats from a given area or a host's specialty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The surrounding may be an old historic old building with antique furniture, a meticulously maintained courtyard, and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and moving on a long journey has an essential attraction in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you’re probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Setting up a tent of any size on private property or in the city can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, using a car is a great way to go on a trip, but it’s rarely a “camping” way by itself.
Camping by car is possible if you have a spacious mini van, off-road car, sedan or caravan with seats that can be lowered.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some hotels possess heritage from the golden age of steam railways and oceangoing ships; before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In those hotels, they resided rich and famous of the time, and often had fine food and nightlife.
Old-fashioned equipment, the lack of the latest amenities and a certain graceful age are also part of their character.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes serve as accommodation for state officials and other respectable people.
A traveler with a lot of money could consider flying around the world, interrupted by stays at many of these hotels.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Hospitality Exchange Network is an organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they want to visit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional confirmation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The list of existing hosts is available in print and/or online, sometimes with recommendations and assessments from other travelers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but did not find a place to stay.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He sent emails to students at the local university and received a huge number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily designed for young people - a typical guest is in his twenties - but you can also often find older travelers there.
Families with children rarely meet, but some hostels still allow them to be in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, so it will be the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and indoor ice competitions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Other ski events will be at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most temples have an annual festival that begins in late November and lasts until mid-May, which differs depending on the annual calendar of each temple.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the anniversary of the temple or the birthday of the supreme deity or other major events associated with the temple.
Kerala temple festivals are very interesting to see, with a regular procession of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities.
The World's Fair (also known as the World Exhibition, or simply Expo) is a major international science and art festival.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Participating countries set up art and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to present problems in the world or the culture and history of their country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< International exhibitions in the field of horticulture are specialized events that show flower arrangements, botanical gardens and anything else that has to do with plants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although they can theoretically be held every year (as long as they are in different countries), in practice they are not held.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These manifestations usually last from three to six months and take place in locations of at least 50 acres.
Over the years, a variety of different film formats have been used. The most commonly used standard film is 35 mm (negative dimension 36-24 mm).
>>srp_Cyrl<< It can generally be fairly easily supplemented if you run out, and gives a resolution almost comparable to the current DSLR.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some medium format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, more specifically the 56 by 56 mm negative.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This gives almost 4 times the resolution of the 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864) negative.
Wildlife is one of the most challenging motives for a photographer, and it needs a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Photography of the wild world is often taken for granted, but as with photography in general, the image is worth a thousand words.
Photographing the wildlife often requires long telephoto lenses, although, for example, flocks of birds or small creatures need different lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about photographing for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty that are served by 50 or more million speakers.
It is also easier to understand written words than spoken ones. This is especially true of addresses, which are often difficult to understand to pronounce.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of entire nations speak English completely fluently, and more and more people speak it to a limited extent - especially in the younger population.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Imagine, if you will, a Mankyunian, a resident of Boston, a Jamaican, and a resident of Sydney sitting at a table and having dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They entertain each other with stories from their birthplaces, told by their specific accents and using local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to feed yourself. However, without conditions for cooking, the choices are limited to ready-made food.
Supermarkets in increasing numbers receive compartments with a greater choice of ready-made food. Some even have microwave ovens or provide other ways to heat the food.
In some countries or types of stores, there is at least one restaurant on the site, often quite informal and with affordable prices.
Make and carry with you copies of your policy and contact details of your insurer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They must show the insured's email address and international phone numbers for advice/authorization and to seek compensation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Keep another copy in your luggage and online (send an email to yourself with an attachment, or save it in a "cloud").
If you are carrying a laptop or tablet on your trip, save a copy in its memory or on disk (which can be accessed without an internet connection).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also give copies of the guidelines/contacts to companions and relatives or friends at home who want to help.
Moose (also known as vapiti) are not inherently aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive something as a threat.
When people do not perceive a moose as potentially dangerous, they can get too close to it and put themselves at risk.
Moderately drink alcoholic beverages. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and knowing your own limit is very important.
Possible long-term health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption may include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger increases when drinking illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal alcoholic beverages can contain a variety of dangerous impurities including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in a foreign country, especially in low-income countries, where the cost of labor is lower.
Consider doing an eye exam at home, especially if it’s covered by insurance, and taking the prescription with you to take it somewhere else.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The frames of top brands available in such areas may have two problems; some may be fake, and the real imported ones may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the most traded items in the world, and you can probably find many species in the area where you live.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways to drink coffee in the world, which are worth trying.
Canyoning (or canyoning) involves going to the bottom of a canyon that is either dry or filled with water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sport - traveling in canyons, combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping - but requires relatively little training or physical constitution to get started (compared to rock climbing, diving or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity consisting of walking in a natural environment, often hiking trails.
Daily walking includes distances that are less than a mile to longer distances that can be covered in a day.
Daily walks along the light path do not require special preparation and every person of moderate fitness will enjoy them.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but spending the day outdoors is easy to do even with babies and preschoolers.
There are almost 200 organizations in the world that deal with racing tours. Most of them function independently.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the successor to Global Ranning Tours, Gou Ranning Tours connects dozens of racing tour service providers on four continents.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With roots in Barcelona Tours running Barcelona and Copenhagen Running Copenhagen, she was quickly joined by Prague-based Tours running Prague and others.
There are a lot of things to consider before and during a trip somewhere.
When you travel, don’t expect things to be like “at home”. Ways of behaving, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language and the rest will differ somewhat from where you live.
This is something that you should always keep in mind, in order to avoid disappointment or maybe even dislike the local ways to do something.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for a trip that is beyond the traveler’s previous experience in terms of nature, culture, language, or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to accept most regular reservations, many agents specialize in special types of travel, budget ranges, and destinations.
It is better to use an agent that often reserves trips similar to yours.
See which travel agent is promoting, either on the website or in the shop window.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you want to see the world cheap, out of necessity, lifestyle, or challenges, there are some ways to do it.
Basically, they fall into two categories: either they work while you travel, or they try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to cut costs almost to zero, take a look at travel with a minimal budget.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is advised that passengers do not steal, raid properties, participate in illegal markets, beg or in any other way use other people for their own good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop after disembarking from an aircraft, ship, or other means of transport.
On some trains that cross borders, checks take place on a moving train, and you should have a valid ID with you when boarding one of these trains.
In trains where you sleep at night, passports can be collected by a conductor, so that you will not break your sleep.
Application is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you need to report your presence and the address at which you are staying to the local authorities.
This may require you to fill out a form at your local police station or that you will need to visit an immigration office.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will take care of the check-in (be sure to ask).
In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodation should sign up. However, this makes the law much more vague, so find out in advance.
Architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction.
Many buildings are pretty nice to look at, and a view from a tall building or from a smartly placed window can be a beauty to behold.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Architecture overlaps considerably with other areas, including urban planning, construction, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how far away many pueblos are, you won’t be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casino clubs on the list below serve drinks, and some of them also bring entertainment in the form of famous brands (mostly the big ones that are immediately near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: bars in small towns are not always good places for visitors from other countries to stay.
One thing, northern New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcohol, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small towns.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unwanted murals and scribbles are known as graffiti.
Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalizing public and private property using spray paint.
However, today there are official graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context more often resemble works of art than unreadable markings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that comes back into your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang to return.
Most boomerangs available in Australia do not actually return. Beginners are advised not to try to throw them when it is windy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hangi dish is prepared under sacha.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pit is heated either by hot stones from the fire or in some places geothermal heat makes the soil areas naturally hot.
Hangi is often used to prepare dinner with baking in the traditional style.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi dishes, while other hangi dishes you can try in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
>>srp_Cyrl<< MetroPlow has two classes on suburban trains inside and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
>>srp_Cyrl<< MetroPlus is more comfortable and there is less crowding in it, but it is slightly more expensive, although it is still cheaper than the price of normal metro tickets in Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro wagons; MetroPlus wagons are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying for others - Never let your bag out of your sight, especially when crossing international borders.
Someone can use you to smuggle drugs without your knowledge, which can get you into a lot of trouble.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This includes waiting in line, as search dogs can be engaged at any time without notice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some countries have excessively draconian sentences even for the first crimes; these may include prison sentences over 10 years or death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bags left unattended are a target for theft, and may also attract the attention of officials, who are cautious when it comes to bomb threats.
At home, due to constant exposure to local microbes, chances are very high that you are already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where you are unfamiliar with the bacteriological fauna, you are more likely to have problems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also, in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hence the plague of traveler's disease called Delhi diarrhea, Pharaoh's curses, Montezuma's revenge, and many of their friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems are quite common in warm climates and in many cases are extremely strenuous, but not really dangerous.
If you're traveling to a developing country for the first time - or a new part of the world - don't underestimate the possible culture shock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many stable, capable travelers have been mastered by novelty trips to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can accumulate quickly.
During the first days, especially consider spending on Western-style hotels and quality hotels, food, and services, which can help you adjust.
Do not sleep on a mattress or ground floor in areas where you do not know the local fauna.
If you’re going to camp out, bring a sleeping bag or net to keep away snakes, scorpions, and the like.
Fill your home with rich coffee in the morning and some relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you’re on vacation close to home, you have time to deal with yourself and spend a couple of extra minutes to come up with something special.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you feel adventurous, take the opportunity to create or fade some confusion:
You may discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in areas you don’t visit often.
For those who are not familiar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are near an infected person.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many governments require that visitors entering or residents leaving their country be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements will often depend on which country the traveler has visited or intends to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers plenty of quality options for family life.
Residents from other areas often cite amenities for the whole family as the main reason to move there, and visitors often note that the city can be easily enjoyed along with the children.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly options in Upper Charlotte has grown exponentially.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Families in Charlotte generally do not use taxis, though they may be of use in some circumstances.
There is an extra charge for more than 2 passengers, so this option could be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only be done during the summer from November to February, and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several thousand employees live here in some fifty bases, mainly in those areas; a small number remain over the winter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The interior of Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered with 2-3 km of ice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Occasionally specialist plane tours go inland, for hiking or to get to Paul who has a large base.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The South Pole route (or highway) is a 1600 km long trail from McMurdo station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is compacted snow with filled cracks and marked with flags. Only special tractors can be driven with it, pulling sleds with fuel and supplies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are not very agile, so the trail must have a long turn around the Transantarctic Mountains to get out onto the plateau.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks, and especially stairs.
The least you need is shoes with a suitable sole. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are inappropriate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hinge should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough at cold temperatures.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some boots have crampons, and there is accessories with crampons for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often thrown onto roads or paths to improve adhesion.
Avalanches are not an abnormality; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow, and anything that goes over it will fall off in the form of an avalanche.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The problem is that snow is sticky, so it needs to be started a little to fall off, and the part of the snow that falls can trigger the rest.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Once the original trigger is just the sun warming the snow, sometimes it is more precipitation in the form of snow, sometimes some other natural events, and often man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A tornado is a spinning column with very low air pressure, which sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They form strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as “lions” descending from storm clouds and become “tornadoes” when they touch the earth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are a great way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: They redirect all internet traffic, not just HTTP.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better quality services. They are encrypted, and it is more difficult to spy on them.
Media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming it is due to “preventing piracy.”
Regional codes have no effect on illegal copying; a bit-by-bit disk works just fine on all devices that the original works on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The real purpose is to give those companies more control over the market; it's all about turning money around.
Since the calls take place over the Internet, you don’t have to use a phone company located in the place where you live or where you travel.
There is no requirement to get a local number in the community where you live; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the wilds of Chikina, Alaska, and choose the number by which you are in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you need to purchase a global number separately that allows you to receive calls from a PSTN phone. This is where the number makes a difference to those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
Some of the apps in this category may even translate texts in foreign languages, to characters or other items in the real world when the user directs the smartphone towards those items.
Translation machines have improved dramatically, so they now provide more or less accurate translations (and less often nonsense), but caution is needed as they still sometimes mistranslate.
One of the most prominent applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading data on the desired language.
Using mobile GPS apps can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you’re out of your country.
It can save you money more than when you buy maps for GPS, or a standalone GPS device, or when you rent the same from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection on your phone, or if you do not have a network, their operation may be limited or unavailable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each local store is full of confusing multitudes of prepaid phone cards that can be used from public pay phones or regular phones.
While most cards are good for calls made to anywhere, some specialize in providing affordable call pricing services to certain groups of countries.
Access to these services is often via a free phone number that can be dialed from most phones at no charge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The rules relating to ordinary photography also apply to video recording, and even more so.
If just taking photos of something isn’t allowed, then you shouldn’t even think about taking a video.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you are using a drone, check in advance what you are allowed to record and what licenses or additional licenses you need.
Drone management near an airport or above a crowd of people is almost always a bad idea, even if it’s not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, air travel is very rarely booked directly with the airline without prior search and price comparison.
Sometimes the same flight can have very different prices on different websites and it’s worth comparing search results, as well as looking at the price on the airline’s website itself before you book.
While you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries when you travel as a tourist or for work, going there as an international student usually requires a longer stay than going as an ordinary tourist.
Generally speaking, staying in any foreign country for a long period of time requires that you obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas usually have different requirements and procedures for applying than ordinary tourist or work visas.
For most countries, you will need a letter of offer of a place from the institution where you want to study, as well as evidence of means of subsistence, at least for the first year of your course.
Contact the institution, as well as the immigration department of the country where you want to study, to get more detailed requirements.
If you’re not a diplomat, working abroad usually means you’ll have to file an income tax return in the country where you’re based.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Income tax is structured differently in different states, and tax rates and tax brackets vary a lot from one country to another.
In some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, income taxes are levied at both federal and local levels, so rates and tax bases may vary from region to region.
Although immigration checks usually don’t exist or it’s a formality once you arrive in your homeland, customs control can be a hassle.
Be sure to inform yourself what you can and cannot enter and report anything that exceeds legal limits.
The easiest way to start writing travelogues is to hone your skills on some famous travel blog website.
Once you get used to formatting and editing on the web, you can create your own website.
Volunteering on a trip is a great way to change something, however it’s not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know different cultures, meet new people, learn something about yourself, get a second perspective, and even gain new skills.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It can also be a good way to stretch the budget to allow for longer stays in a place, given that many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and lodging, and some get a small salary.
Vikings used Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these roads can still be used. Check if special permits may be needed, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga, and St. Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to reach it from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Be sure that as soon as you get to the pier, everything will be quite obvious. You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Basically, you'll set up notices where you offer your help, you'll walk down the pier, you'll approach people who clean their yachts, you'll try to make contact with sailors in bars etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and give you hints about which boat is looking for someone.
You should choose your airline carefully for frequent flying within the alliance.
While you might think it’s intuitive to join the airline you fly most, you should be aware that the privileges offered are often different, and the points for frequent flyers may be higher with another airline within the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa, and offer connections to many major African cities at more competitive prices than other European airlines.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you have extra time to travel, try to compare your total fare to Africa with the fare for a round-the-world trip.
Don’t forget to count the extra costs of additional visas, outbound fees, land transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the Southern Hemisphere, your choice of flights and destinations are limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No aviation alliance covers all 3 ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of the crossings).
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Star Alliance covers all but the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, covered by LATAM Vanworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to get around the South Pacific and the west coast of South America.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan fought a war against Azeris in 1994.
With the help of Armenia, a new republic was created. However, no existing state - not even Armenia - recognizes it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Diplomatic discussions over the region continue to violate relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kanal County (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century district surrounding Amsterdam's Binnenstad.
The entire district is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chinque Terre, meaning five countries, consists of five small coastal villages - Ryomaggiore, Manarola, Cornilius, Vernaca and Monterosso - located in the Italian area of Liguria.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on uneven, steep areas along the very cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of the charm of this place is that there is no visible corporate development. Trails, trains and boats connect villages, while cars do not have access from the outside.
The varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from French spoken in France, although they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the numerical systems in the French-speaking regions of Belgium and Switzerland have some minor peculiarities that distinguish them from French in France, and the pronunciation of some words is somewhat different.
Regardless, all Belgians and Swiss who speak French have learned standard French in school, so they would be able to understand you if you would use a standard French number system.
In many countries of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means "hello".
However, in Malaysia, even among Malays in rural areas, it means “come here”, which is similar to the index finger bent towards the body, which is a sign used in certain Western countries, and which should be used only for this purpose.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may misunderstand waving when leaving with the palm facing the person waving (rather than the person waving) as a gesture to return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or planned languages, created with the intention of facilitating communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are distinct from lingua francas, which are natural or organic languages that for some reason become dominant as a means of communication among speakers of other languages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the heat of the day, travelers may have mirages that give them the illusion of water (or other things).
It can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirageorgan, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the warmest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothes.
Especially in summer you need to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to walk through the rainforest.
Even if you’re driving through a subtropical rain forest, a few seconds with the door open as you enter the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get into the vehicle with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bird flu, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fewer than a thousand cases have been recorded in humans, but some of them were fatal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most cases were people working with poultry, but there is some risk for birdwatchers as well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For Norway, steep fjords and valleys are characteristic after which high, more or less flat plateaus are suddenly provided.
These highlands are often referred to as "vides" which means wide, open space without trees, boundless space.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In Rogaland and Agder, they are commonly called "hey", meaning a swamp without trees often covered in heat.
Glaciers are not stable, but descend down the mountain. This leads to the formation of cracks and cracks in the ice, which can be hidden under a snow cover.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There may be demolition of walls and roofs of ice caves, as well as closure of cracks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the edge of the glacier, huge blocks break up, fall and may jump or roll away from the edge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The tourist season in hill towns usually peaks during Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, when many hilly places get a good amount of snow and offer activities like skiing and snowboarding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only a few airlines still offer mourner tickets that slightly lower last-minute travel costs in the event of a funeral.
Airlines offering this include Air Canada, Delta Airlines and Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, as well as Westjet.
In any case, you need to make a reservation by phone by contacting the airline directly.
