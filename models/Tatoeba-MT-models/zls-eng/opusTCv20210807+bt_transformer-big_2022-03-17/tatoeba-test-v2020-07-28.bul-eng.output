Can you come back tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There is no way to hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand what's important.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat down on a log.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and saw the city again.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I snore.
We've been using this insecticide for 2 years.
Come and help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, too bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned up his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, not because she's beautiful, but because she's nice to everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Come back any time.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.

Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles per hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.

Could this be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police must not take bribes.
I was up in the mountains.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?

Don't look at the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ring.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why should I study French?
She's not tall.
That's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've worn clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's shorter than average.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I really don't know Tom that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
This is partly true.
He's lived here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.

I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, go ahead, I'm with you.
Has Mike stopped drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The match was postponed for some time.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken has arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
Thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He wants to speak French from the inside.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
Sorry.
Is this book yours?
I always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What is the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's gross.
What is the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm bargaining with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father rarely smokes.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
It doesn't change anything.
I have a lunch date with him.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope this helps.
What'd you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.

These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom tries to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no older than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne has no sisters.
Tom has small hands.
He arrived two days early.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom over the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
We're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her operatic singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
A number of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
Tom is easy to talk to.
Twin brothers are very similar.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the joke.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have some very bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how much time I spend learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's party.
It won’t be just you there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm angry at myself.
This was done by Tom.
You won’t believe the things people throw away.
I quit smoking for a year.
Don’t carry a lot of baggage when you travel.
I've got Tom's picture right here.
I haven't told you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
Accuse her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know, she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage over the others.
I tricked you.
Take him with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me in public.
The bulb's burned.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Shrink it down.
What do you say we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where is the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all took it for granted that Tom could speak French.
Tom went back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I would like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night owl.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do what you will, but I will hinder it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning to swim on my vacation.
Which way is the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me get off that easy.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight-thirty.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach, there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
Coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.

By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I have nothing.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you answer it?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to comply with their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was so stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I speak to my employees in French.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom has a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so smoky that it was hard to breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
Is Spot gone too?
I promise I'll get it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a raincoat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
What do you say we study together at the library?
I have work to do.
The job offer is still in effect.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Green suits you.
Fingers crossed.

Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.

Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this store are engaged in kitchen utensils.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom did not respond immediately.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works at that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to Mount Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political issue has sparked heated debate.

Unemployment is rising.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to freshen up your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We learn French in school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please, have patience.
Your joke goes too far.
I had a really good time today.

Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You must be mistaken.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a checking account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in the presence of his father.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
It's a weird problem.
I don't get that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got an A.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he discovered that Mary had disappeared.
I'm sewing my shirt.
You coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.

Tom, wake up.
How will you get home?

I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I haven't eaten at all.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol went back to her hotel.
Do you like this color?
Please be brief.

The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary is going out with two people at the same time.
There's no sign of Tom yet.
Pass it to me.
Did you get everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I woke up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm looking for something less expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll put in more effort.
I've already done my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Its charm is a mixture of cheerfulness and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
We're almost there.
I like that color.
My grandmother had an operation in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you with Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I get a chance to return the favor.
Tom searched the drawer to see if there was any pen he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to know the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great!
That doesn't bother me.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained it in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with this.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process is producing good results.
That is his ignorance.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you subtract six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
Which club do you belong to?
Atsushi could have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Get back to your seat.
He graduated from Cambridge with honors.
I have to bring her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Does Tom learn French in school?
What shoes are they?
We definitely worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it gets warmer.
He began to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How old are your kids?
I'll stay till tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I quit.
You don't even know half of it.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'm gonna help you get better at this.

How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.

I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.

Go home.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is very attractively dressed.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.

The film is made of polyethylene.
I solved the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.

You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a taxi cost?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastic began his worthy endeavor.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more specific.
I'm on vacation this week.
I'm washing my socks.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't speak French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I have no doubt about his sincerity.
Please open the package.
It's on me.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Did you see the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy on both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She wears makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make me look nice.
I have no money.
Millie eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are now fashionable.
He does very well with children.
Come in, please.
We really had fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't make a habit of it.
It finally stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She didn’t give me much of a clue as to what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What shall we eat?
Keep it a secret.
You're making me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do this.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What is the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd love to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just walk in here and start gossiping about people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck in traffic and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the Maritime Museum.
Tom made a lot of effort to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
I want to speak French today.
You want to tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it personally.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was covered in gravy.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
He won't get any help from Mary Tom.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a fur coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
It's been a good year for you.
It was cleaned.
I can't do that.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom took the bus home.
For me, an afternoon meeting is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
This is the hospital where I was born.
I never liked biology.
I'm very indebted to you for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd love to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to drop out of school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the guy who told me when the meeting was going to be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began to return home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She has reached adulthood.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to see the movie.
Those who are well prepared, don’t worry.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves silkworms live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
My joints hurt.

Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.

That's what I'm looking for.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.

I know what your problem is.
You definitely shouldn't lick the floor.
Let's do this.
I'll bring it to your attention in a moment.
Sorry to interrupt.
You guys are really great.
Everything's fine.
Are your gums bleeding?
People were puzzled by the unexpected situation.
Are you registered?
How do you know French so well?
I speak French.
She pulled him out of his bad mood.
What's in the bag?
He's not as impatient as his father.

Aren't we friends?
Go slow and I'll catch up.
Do you have a camera?
Can I take a look at this?
My dad won't let me go to the movies alone.
Where is the nearest pharmacy?
Tom's the one who told me what to do.
Tom understands what you don't.
It's not a trick.
He disguises himself as a woman.

You often miss a letter.
I want a complete list of your books.
They say it's nice.
My parents send you their special greetings.
You're my best friend.

You're exactly as I pictured you.
That's enough.

One language is never enough.
He loves trains.
I like to walk at night.
She gave me a nice doll.
Don't worry about it.
I think you'll like this one.
The wise man hurts me.
Go back to bed.
I have three grown sons.
My girl doesn't know.
It seems that most people give up before they realize their potential.
I missed you.
There must be something else to eat.
I know you're right.
I've never had Chinese food.
You're not married?
I told Tom all about Mary.
The baby looked just like its mother.
I don't want to sell my soul to the devil.
Which do you like better, the coke or the Pepsi?
Tom had received his education at home.
My dad's here.
He took out his passport.

I'm watching TV.
I'm sure she's right.
Can you handle it?

We're men.
How do you work with this camera?
Do not smoke in the toilet.
Do you have an elevator in your house?
Do you have this new book?
Tom, are these yours?
Shall we?
He'll be home soon.
Two places for the lunch buffet, please.
I think Tom's gonna win.
Meg annoys Ken sometimes.
Are you going or not?
I think we should wait.
My parents bha finished eating before I got home.

My favorite team lost yesterday.
I'm fed up.
I have important news.
They all knew Tom.
Tom and Mary speak French.
I made coffee.
Tom didn't say what he was planning to do.
Tom's over 30.
I heard you talking to Tom.
I'm just a little jealous.
Give it to me!
Tom's always blown away.
I wouldn't blame you.
This is ridiculous.
How did you come up with that?
Shut up and listen.
The doctors found some shocking facts.
It's good to know you.
We had no choice but to wait.
You sure you don't want some?
It's almost 10:00.
Tom told me he might have heard something, but he wasn't sure what it was.
Are you the new assistant?
I think you're really amazing.
If I miss the train, I'll take the bus.
Do you really want to swim?
Dropping a kite can be dangerous.
I'm not a teacher.
He slept well last night.
Don't you have to go?

Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you'd better do something with your life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor's slippery, watch out.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.

Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.

Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom is not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept filming.

Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.

Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You've been given a chance.

It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
I found the new magazine very interesting.

I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the cupboard.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?

Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.

The bulb's burned.
I need to get Tom his money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.

I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the coat hanger by the door.
Tom lives three blocks from the shore.
He's a bit of a celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admitted that he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you will probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn’t as much fun as the book.
The job didn't bother me.
I think you're perfect.
Each human being is a part of the whole called by us Universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be to free ourselves from this prison and expand the circle of our compassion
He will undoubtedly come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I need to fill out this form in French?

He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that makes me nervous.
Both of Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far from here?
Bad weather didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.

I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.

You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a shirt that fits that jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's kind of a star.

The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your connection to him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let’s talk seriously about your future.
I've got a few calls to make myself.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The couple went on a trip around the world.

I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
There was a terrible accident yesterday.

Look closely at the map on the wall.

I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
This is very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive right on the road and when you pass the traffic light, you are there.
Do what you want.

Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know someone who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.

I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand what's important.
I still haven't figured that out.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night was an exciting game.
Wide jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little bit of goodwill on both sides, our problems should be able to be solved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed the stairs.
The house we used to live in was destroyed.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you get Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Put me down on this side of the light, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever said hello to Pfirsichbumchen in German?
There's been an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't that be nice?

Why am I so sleepy?

That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married, and we want to get our heads straight.
Don't go in that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you gonna eat that cupcake?
I've been working hard for the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This can be a bit burdensome.
Looks like we're running out of water.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
Green suits Alice.
Our garbage is collected three times a week.
They trapped the fox.
You're early.
You like kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They were late because of the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Slow down, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We have to be careful.
It's eleven now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Are you learning French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You should use deodorant.
When I stand up, I feel dizzy.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to be a part of this.
You don't seem too surprised.
This is a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat. Can you serve us quickly? We must have left by half past one.
Let's get some sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing to speak French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have nice hands.
The people in general are against war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We learn French at school every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
I have nothing.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than we listen, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My dad often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
Nothing was known of him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
Everybody's hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid due to oversight, please send the amount due and allow us to remedy the problem immediately.

It's very kind of you to go out of your way to help me.

I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.

Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.

They exchange gifts.
Personally, I don't mind.

I hope that's enough.
You need to emphasize that fact.
This one's okay.

Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
It's only four minutes from here by train.
What is Tom trying to accomplish?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little greasy.
I think we'd better go.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?

Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it after all.
Can you do it yourself?
She blushed.
You think I'm that stupid?

That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.

Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind blew in gusts.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her eldest daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
I have work on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would you do it?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the school principal.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
I'm embarrassed in her presence.
She bought him a dog. However, he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
In those days there was no television or radio.
She took a taxi to the museum.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I don't agree with Tom.

I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a bunch of kids he shouldn't.
It'd be good if you didn't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use dental floss.
We got there quickly because the traffic wasn't busy.
You have to be careful.
What do you miss?
He recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses look good on you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the cramp is over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't be helping us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French more difficult than English?
That pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in autumn.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
There seem to be over two thousand Uyghur sentences in Tatoeba already!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the reunion.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cross here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Are you thinking of going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy humanity.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected by these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't put it away yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest weakness.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, right?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It costs nothing.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers fade without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
The salt is gone.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and release this letter in the meantime.
This hen hasn't laid a single egg lately.

The moment of glory for Hanshin did not last long.
Does he have a big house?
Won't that lead to problems?
He resented being called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
You really want to do this?
Will he fail the exam?
I don't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions did they draw?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I need to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put the pie on the windowsill to cool off.
Happy is the man who marries a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
What a pity!
Say hi to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?

Of course, she's right.

She brushed her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
How does Tom deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I didn't talk to you before, did I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is a picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
It's Tom's camera, isn't it?

Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.

They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know someone who can speak French well.
Check out that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can’t do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
See you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I just look at things realistically.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.

I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me that sooner.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.

Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.

I want some orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like a Frenchman.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where is the ticket office located?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little carried away dancing, and I went up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was tumbling down the uneven road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind you.
She took the exam.
I'm going to the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes in the exam.
This book is not Tom's.
Where was that?
I have to take it off.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a grown man now.
Let's not fool ourselves.
I got better.

The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.

I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Are you in debt yet?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom is tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom's been unwell lately.
I have to tell you something first.
A coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have a choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the last name first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was a pale reminder of his father in appearance.

We don't want you to feel pressured.
Raisins are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.

I need to know.
When does it end?
I get sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.

I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?

There's been silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You're learning French, aren't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should talk in English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct a survey on the date of the exam.
Maybe we're missing the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.

He'll make it to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
One has to work.
Hey, guys.
They eat apples.
I received her letter yesterday.
I've been very volatile lately. My favorite football team is going west.
I easily fell for the sweet talk.

I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a native speaker.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light.
Tom's hurt himself.
His room is a mess.
They spend some of their free time taking care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?

You'd better put on a sweater under your jacket.

How complicated is that?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum, it's under reconstruction.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Add this site to "Favorites".
I have a lot to say about that.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's your business.

You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I care.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's happening.
Do I make myself clear?
Many parents worry that their children are not getting basic knowledge of numbers.
I studied philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give some of the work to the junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very pretty girl.
Tom can't do it.
No matter what you do, you can’t force a person to believe in something, much less themselves.
I don't feel so good.
The air conditioner's not working.
You're in my seat.
Is something scaring you?
Everyone agrees with you.

I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I shudder to think of it.

I think you should check under the bed.
It won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another appointment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up this watch for a while, not to mention giving it up permanently.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.

Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I was not in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruit to oranges.
This place is worth a visit at least once.
He continued to read the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister ironed her shirt.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I picked up your book until I left it, I was always laughing my head off, and someday I'm going to start reading it.

Both Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around and blaspheme people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I borrow money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
It seems all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.

I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice present.
You coming?
Let's meet at 2:30
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During the holidays, I read all of Milton's work.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked a question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be so quick to defend me.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as small.
Tom's not used to city life.
You kept your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting in too much sugar.

His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, which would you choose?
The answer is correct.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far so good.
This species is endangered.

How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's a friend of mine.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved significantly compared to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We've finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you elaborate a little more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we should look into it.
So we're all in agreement.
If the weather allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna be a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You're not gonna believe this.
Can you come at nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a duty-free store?
I'm looking for a present for my girlfriend.
I wish I'd told you, kel fida.
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
He looks like a man from afar.
We worked hard to make ends meet.
Morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her what.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

You should not jump to conclusions.
Don't worry about it.

When Tom woke up, he discovered that Mary had disappeared.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Alas!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deeply asleep.
She called him whatever.
Are we capable of that?
My sister's name is Patricia.

Move on.
It’s a challenge for me and I’m learning a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look, Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.

What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as possible.
He entered the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th and it's Muirille's birthday.
