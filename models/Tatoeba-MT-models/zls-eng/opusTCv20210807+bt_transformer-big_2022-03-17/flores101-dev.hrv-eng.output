He noted that some studies have shown that the disease must have a lower mortality rate before it can cause a global epidemic.
>>bos_Latn<< There is concern that patients will infect even more people as they lead their usual lives if flu symptoms remain mild.
Leslie Aun, a spokeswoman for the Komen Foundation, said that the organization has adopted a new rule that does not allow grants and funding to be awarded to organizations under judicial investigation.
Ms. Komen's rule disqualified Planned Parenthood based on an open investigation by MP Cliff Stearns into how Planned Parenthood spends and reports money.
Stearns, in his role as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is under the auspices of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is investigating whether taxes are being used to fund abortion through Planned Parenthood.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won Tuesday's election for Florida's Republican presidential candidate with over 46 percent of the vote.

Organisers of the protests said around 100,000 people had gathered in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
According to police estimates, the number of protesters in Berlin was 6,500.
Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, about 200 people protested outside the offices of some major copyright holders.
Mass protests took place in Poland last month when the country signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, leading to the Polish government's decision not to ratify the agreement so far.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining ACTA.
The Animal Liberation Movement and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again demanding the mandatory placement of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief Inspector for RSPCA New South Wales David O'Shannessy told ABC that monitoring and inspections of slaughterhouses should be common in Australia.
"The surveillance cameras would certainly send a strong message to those who work with animals that their well-being is their top priority.""
The U.S. Geological Survey's international earthquake map did not record an earthquake in Iceland in the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Service said there had been no earthquakes in the Hekla region in the past 48 hours.
Significant seismic activity that led to the phase change was recorded on March 10 on the northeast side of the caldera at the top of the volcano.
Dark clouds that have nothing to do with volcanic activity have been observed at the foot of the mountain.
>>bos_Latn<< The clouds presented the possibility of confusion as to whether there really was an eruption.

Karno is a well-known controversial English teacher who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory schools, and at the height of his career claimed to have more than 9,000 students.
In his notes, he used words that some parents thought were harsh, and he allegedly cursed in class.
The Modern Education School accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorization and false allegations claiming he was the head teacher of English.
He was also previously charged with copyright infringement, but was not criminally charged.
A former student said he “used slang in the classroom, shared notes on love affairs and acted like a friend.”
Although officially still a communist state, China has developed a market economy over the past three decades.
The first economic reforms were made during the reign of Deng Xiaoping.
China has been 90 times stronger since that time.
>>bos_Latn<< Last year, China for the first time had higher car exports than Germany, and overtook the United States as the industry's largest market.
China’s GDP could be larger than that of the United States in two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth storm of the 2010 hurricane season to be named, formed in the east of the Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum wind strength of 40 miles/h (64 km/h).
Scientists at the State Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from the coast, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, Bobek gained fame playing for Partizan Belgrade.
>>bos_Latn<< He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
In a period spent with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
No one has played more matches and scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was named the best player in the history of the Partizan club.
The celebration was opened by a special performance by the famous group Cirque du Soleil.
This was followed by the performance of the State Symphony Orchestra from Istanbul, the Janissary Military Orchestra, and singers Fatih Erkos and M?sl?m G?rses.

Stars emit light and heat due to the energy that occurs when hydrogen atoms fuse (or fuse) into heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, it is difficult to find a solution to this problem and it will be many years before useful fusion reactors are built.
A steel needle floats on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other, more than they are attracted to the air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible membrane on the surface of the water that allows things like needles to float on the water.
The blade on modern skates has a double edge with a concave indentation in between. The two edges allow better grip on the ice, even when tilting.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade is tilted to one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curved.
If the sliders tilt to the right, the slider turns to the right, and if they tilt to the left, it turns to the left.
To return to the previous energy level, they have to get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
"They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a 'photon.'"
"Scientists call this process ""stimulated radiation emission"" because bright light excites atoms, which causes the emission of photons of light, and light is a type of radiation."
The following image shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, photons are in reality much smaller than in the picture.
>>bos_Latn<< Photons are even smaller than the substances that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the incandescent filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the bulb no longer works.
Then it is necessary to replace the bulb. It is important to be careful when replacing bulbs.
First of all, it is necessary to turn off the switch for the lighting fixture or disconnect the cable.
This is because the current that affects the throat in the place where the metal part of the bulb is attached can cause a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the throat or the metal bottom of the bulb while the part of the bulb is still in the throat.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, the role of which is to pump blood.
The blood from the heart flows through tubes called arteries and returns to the heart again with tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops teeth were able to crush not only the leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that triceratops ate chicadine, a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.
These plants look like small palms with a canopy full of sharp prickly leaves.
>>bos_Latn<< Triceratops may have used a strong beak to pluck leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that they were eaten by dinosaurs, although today sloths and other animals such as parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you were standing on the surface of the moon Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 90 kg (200 pounds) on Earth would weigh 16 kg (36 pounds) on Io. So gravity is weaker than on Earth.
The sun doesn't have a crust to stand on like the Earth does, and the sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
Gas becomes rarer as you move away from the center of the Sun.

About three millennia later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus has phases just like the moon.
The changes occur because only the side of Venus (or Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. Venus's changes support Copernicus' theory that planets move around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks spotted Venus transiting.
England entered a long period of peace after the re-conquest of Danelaw.
However, in 991 Ethelred faced a Viking fleet smaller only than that of Guthrum a hundred years earlier.
The fleet was led by Norwegian Olaf Trygvasson, who had the ambition to rescue his country from the Danish aggressors.
After initial military failures, Ethelred was able to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to regain his kingdom, in which he was not completely successful.
Hangeul is the only planned script that is in everyday use. The letter was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth and one of the most beloved kings of the Joseon dynasty.
>>bos_Latn<< "Originally the alphabet hangul was called hunmin jeongeum which means ''accurate voices to teach people''".
There are many theories about the origin of Sanskrit. According to one, the language was brought by a group of Aryans who migrated from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit was lost due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language and the source of many modern Indian languages, such as the Latin source of European languages such as French or Spanish.
When the battle for France ended, Germany began preparations for an attack on Britain.
"Germany called the operation code ""Operation Sea Lion"". Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost during the evacuations from Dunkirk so that the army was quite weak. "
>>bos_Latn<< "But the Royal Navy was stronger than the German (""Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any fleet that would invade the English Channel."
However, very few Royal Navy ships were located near possible directions of attack as the admirals feared the ships would sink in a German air attack.
"Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was mostly the "younger brother" of Germany and Japan."
It had a weaker army and navy, although four new ships were built shortly before the war began.
The Italian main objective was African countries. To capture these countries, they needed to have troops sailing the Mediterranean and conquering Africa.
To achieve this, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Italian battleships were not to take anything other than these actions.
>>bos_Latn<< As far as Japan is concerned, it is an island country, just like Great Britain.
>>bos_Latn<< Submarines are ships designed to move and stay underwater longer.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. They were very slow at the time and had a limited firing range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed above the surface of the sea, but as the radar developed and became more precise, the submarines were forced to go below the surface so that they could not be seen.
The German submarines were known as the U-Boot. The Germans were very good at managing submarines.
Due to the success they achieved with submarines, it is not desirable for the Germans to have a large number of submarines in the post-war period.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King Tut" or "Boy-King" is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, it was not considered important in ancient times and is not recorded on most lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of this tomb in 1922 made it famous. Many tombs in history were looted, but this one remained almost intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the spoked wheels made the Assyrian chariot lighter, faster, and better prepared to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly bows could pierce the armor of the enemy. c. 1000 BC The Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
Cavalry is an army that fights on horses. The saddle was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who compiled two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems to Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remain popular playwrights, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is best known for his famous treatise on the relations of the sides of a rectangular triangle.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are counted or not.
There are an estimated 340 to 500 million speakers, and 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary, but a different script. In everyday speech, speakers of both languages can usually communicate.
Northern Estonia was under great cultural influence from Germany around the 15th century.
Certain German monks wanted to bring God closer to the indigenous population, so they invented the Estonian literary language.
"It was based on the German alphabet, and one character was added ""/""."
As time went on, many words borrowed from German came together. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne after finishing school goes straight to the army.
"However, Charles studied anthropology and archaeology, and then history, at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a ""2:2"" (lower second-degree, i.e. good success) success."

Turkey is surrounded by the sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but has been independent since 1839.
The present parts of Belgium in the past belonged to Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution in the 1930s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but has been under occupation by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the European Union.
>>bos_Latn<< Drukgyal Dzong are the remains of a fort and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro County (in the village of Phondey).

Creating interactive media requires common and traditional skills, as well as tools that are mastered in interactive teaching (illustrated drafts, editing of audio and video recordings, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design involves rethinking one's own assumptions about creating media content and practicing thinking in a non-linear way.
In interactive design, it is necessary that parts of the project are connected to each other, but also that they independently make sense.
The disadvantage of the zoom lens lies in the fact that the complexity of the focus and the number of lens elements required for the focal length range is much higher than for the basic lenses.
This is no longer such a problem as manufacturers have higher standards in lens manufacturing.
This made it possible to use a zoom lens to produce an image whose quality can be compared to that achieved by fixed focal length lenses.
>>bos_Latn<< Another disadvantage of a magnifying lens is that the largest diameter (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
Therefore, cheap zoom lenses are difficult to use in low-light conditions without flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a film to DVD format is overscanning.
Most TVs are designed to please the general population.
That's why everything you watch on TV has its top, bottom and side edges cut off.
This is done so that the image covers the entire screen and is called overlaying.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges are likely to be cut too, and if the subtitles were too low, it will not be fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castle has long captured the imagination and conjured up scenes of fighting, banqueting and chivalry from the legend of Arthur.
Even standing in the middle of millennial ruins, you can easily imagine the sounds and smells of battles from past times and almost hear the rattle of hooves on the cobblestones and feel the fear rising from the underground dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a well-established house than a real castle, which is typical for this period.
Large glazed windows and thin walls would not be able to withstand a decisive attack for a long time.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, the land was relatively peaceful and needed to be protected only from small groups of wandering bandits.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain national sovereignty in all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to strive to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful and that is why state governments often switched allies to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war to concern itself primarily with the balance of power.
This was an important turning point, as the European powers no longer had an excuse for religious wars, and the Thirty Years’ War would be the last so-called religious war.
Artemis' temple at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC due to an arson committed by Herostat.
According to the story, he was willing to do anything to become famous. The Ephesians were so furious that they ordered that the name of Herodotus was never written down.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded the name and so it is known today. The temple was destroyed the night Alexander the Great was born.
>>bos_Latn<< Alexander as king offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was declined. after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Relax the fist as much as possible, while still correctly guessing all the notes. Also, try not to make superfluous movements with your fingers.
This way you will get less tired. Remember that there is no need to forcefully press the keys to achieve a louder sound, unlike the piano.
To achieve additional volume on the accordion, handle the bellows harder or faster.
Mysticism is the search for communion, identity, or awareness of a fundamental truth, deity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or insight into the divine reality, i.e., divinity or deities.
Followers lead certain lifestyles or apply practices designed to cultivate such experiences.
Mysticism is different from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes a direct personal experience through a unique state of mind, especially with calm, deep, blissful or even ecstatic personalities.
Sikhism is a religion on the Indian peninsula. It was begun in the Punjab region during the 15th century due to the schism of Hindu sects.
Sikhs hold that their faith is not a form of Hinduism, although they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.
"The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in the Punjabi language means ""the way of the guru". The guru is the fundamental sight of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it takes on the role of an important foundation at the heart of the faith."
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539).
However, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956 when riots in Poland, as part of which workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to establish order, he made concessions regarding certain economic demands and agreed to the appointment of the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization belonged to the Bronze Age and lived in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, encompassing most of modern Pakistan and certain areas in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization, as its name suggests, flourished in the Indus Valley.
However, some scholars argue that the civilization should be called Ind-Sarasvati because it also existed in the basin of the now dried up Sarasvati River. Some call it the Harappa civilization after Harappa, the first excavation in the 1920s.
The militarism of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical forces to use after the battle.
Surgeons knew of various sedatives such as morphine from poppy seed extract and scopolamine from bun seeds.
They mastered the method of amputation that saved the lives of patients with gangrene, and also used a tourniquet and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire made great discoveries in the field of medicine and formed the knowledge that is still known to us today.
Pureland origami is an origami style in which it is allowed to make only one fold at a time, more complex folds such as inverted folds are not allowed, and all folds must be straight.
This technique was developed by John Smith in the 1970s as an aid to inexperienced puzzlers or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an early awareness of race and racial stereotypes, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children belonging to a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, do not achieve good academic results usually give in at school when they learn about a stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
Websites have attracted a lot of attention, especially in educational systems.
Such websites also have positive sides, including the ease of setting up a class page, which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other elements.
The site can be easily accessed via a single web address, making it easier for students who have difficulty using a keyboard or spelling to remember and type in a browser.
The page is easy to customize for easier reading and can be reduced or increased in color.
Attention Deficit Disorder is a neurological syndrome defined by a classic triad of symptoms that include impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity, or excess energy.
"It's not an inability to learn, it's a learning disorder." "It affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe as many as 2 million American children."
Children with attention deficit disorder have a hard time focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on what gives them pleasure, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
"These children often get into trouble because they ""engage in risky behaviors, quarrel and challenge authority""" to stimulate their brain, which cannot be stimulated by the usual methods."
ADD affects relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why children suffering from ADD behave in a certain way or why they write in a certain way, nor that their degree of maturity is different from others.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learn has changed in the way described above, the basic rate of knowledge acquisition has also changed.
The approach to receiving information was different. There was no longer any pressure on individual memory, but the focus rested more on the ability to recall text.
>>bos_Latn<< The Renaissance actually brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, lean, or swing through treetops.
Chimpanzees have palms and feet of similar size and length, which is the result of using palms to carry weight when walking using the wrists of the fist.
The human hand is shorter than the leg and has straighter articles.
Fossil remains of two to three million-year-old hands suggest a shift from starting to manipulating.
Some people believe that experiencing more artificially induced lucid dreams, if it happens often enough, can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the fact that lucid dreams prolong the period between REM phases.
If you have fewer REM phases at night, the state in which you really sleep and the body recovers becomes not often enough to be a problem.
It’s just as exhausting as waking up every twenty to thirty minutes to watch TV.
The result depends on how often at night your brain tries to lucidly dream.
Within a week of Italy’s declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussar Regiment occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
>>bos_Latn<< In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, commander of the 10th Army.
Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and direct successor to Mussolini, was killed in a friendly fire while landing in Tobruk on 28 June.
Modern fencing as a sport exists on several levels. It is trained by students at universities and is part of professional and Olympic competitions.
>>bos_Latn<< The sport is mainly played in duel format, one swordsman fighting the other.
Golf is a game in which players use sticks to hit holes with balls.
Usually eighteen holes are played, and players usually start at the first hole in the field and finish at the eighteenth.
The winner is the player who performs the least kicks or swings with the bat to end the game on the field.
The game takes place on the grass, and the grass around the hole is mowed so that it is shorter and called "Green".
Probably the most widespread type of tourism is the one that most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
Then people go to a place that is different from their everyday life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites often represent the places that recreational tourists visit the most.
If the goal of visiting an area is to get to know the history and culture of the area, then we are talking about cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights in a particular country or simply devote themselves to just one area.
>>bos_Latn<< After the colonists spotted the activity, they called for reinforcements.
The troops strengthening the forward positions were both the 1st and 3rd regiments of New Hampshire with 200 soldiers, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men took up positions along the northern wall of the colonists.
When the tide made a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a stone wall to the north to a small beach on the coast.
Gridley or Stark placed a 100-foot (30 m) stake in front of the fence and ordered that no one be fired until ordinary soldiers passed.
The U.S. plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalader was to carry out a diversionary attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block reinforcements.
General James Ewing was to lead 700 troops across the river at Trenton Ferry, block the bridge over the Assunpink stream and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault unit consisting of 2,400 soldiers was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Green's and the other under Sullivan's command, to begin the attack before dawn.
With the change in race length from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed becomes much less important, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, the first-class runner at 800 m, who can run in two minutes, must be quite fast, but in any case he must work on endurance.
A little cross running in winter combined with upper body exercise in the gym is the best preparation for the racing season.
Proper eating habits alone cannot create top performance, but they can significantly affect the general health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy and balanced energy intake, effective fluid intake habits and knowledge of the various aspects of taking nutritional supplements can allow athletes to perform better and enjoy sports more.
Running at medium distances is a relatively inexpensive sport. However, there are many misconceptions regarding the few pieces of equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them have little or no effect on performance.
Athletes may find that they prefer a product even if it is of no real use to them.
Atoms can be considered one of the basic building blocks of all substances.
It is a very complex entity that, according to the Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus around which electrons revolve, similar to planets revolving around the sun - see Figure 1.1.
>>bos_Latn<< The nucleus consists of two particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electric charge.
Before you examine the victim, make sure you're safe.
You need to be careful of where the victim is when approaching and notice any worrying details.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you will only make the situation worse.
The study found that depression, fear and the experience of disaster are mediators in the relationship between pain and stiffness in the back.
Only the effects of catastrophizing, not depression and fear, depended on regular weekly periods of structured physical activity.
Those who participated in regular activities required more support in terms of negative pain experience while noting the difference between chronic pain and discomfort caused by normal physical movements.
Vision, that is, the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, that is, the eyes.
There are many different structures of the eyes, the complexity of which depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness; also, they require different processing methods when interpreting inputs and different values for optimal operation.
A population is a group of individuals of the same species inhabiting a particular geographical area.
>>bos_Latn<< In the case where all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic feature, they are referred to as monomorphic.
If individuals have several versions of a particular property, we consider them polymorphic.
>>bos_Latn<< The colonies of warrior ants also walk and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, military ants march at night and rest during the day.
The colony begins the nomadic phase when food supplies are reduced. During this phase, the colony builds temporary anthills that are replaced every day.
>>bos_Latn<< Each such nomadic walk lasts about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word ""cella"" meaning ""small room"" and was first coined by a microscopist who observed the structure of a cork cork."
A cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are so essential and crucial to the study of life that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of life."
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep blood flow undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent through the body very quickly, which helps keep the body safe from possible danger.
A tornado appears in a small area compared to other powerful storms, but it can destroy everything in its path.
Tornadoes destroy trees, tear the floorboards off buildings and blow up cars. Two percent of the most violent tornadoes lasted more than three hours.
These monstrous storms bring winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been producing and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will never go away, and the nature of cooperation is such that when the majority has some benefit, it means that in the short term the individual will pay more to act selfishly
Let’s hope that most people will understand that it is better to work with others in the long run.
Many dream of a day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some wonder what is in the universe, and some believe that aliens or other forms of life may live on another planet.
"But if that ever happens, it probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so far apart that the 'neighboring' stars share trillions of kilometers."
Maybe one day your grandchildren will stand on top of the alien world thinking about their ancestors?
Animals consist of many cells. They eat food and digest it inside the body. Most animals move.
Only animals have brains (although they do not have everything; for example, jellyfish do not have brains).
Animals live all over the world, digging underground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living (things) organisms.
The station comes from the Latin word cella, meaning small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they consist of squares or balls.
The English biologist Robert Hooke observed small squares in the cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to see the dead cells
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another without change.
Nitrogen in the gaseous state has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are still the same.
Another example is water. A water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is in a gaseous, liquid, or solid state.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects us, and it is hard to understand.
Religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a sequence of events that moves from the future through the present to the past.
Time also serves to compare the duration (length) of the event.
You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of cyclic phenomena. A cyclic phenomenon is something that is repeated regularly.
Today's computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
On computers, sophisticated animations can be created that are increasingly used on television and in movies.
Music is often recorded on advanced computers that are used for processing and mixing sound.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori who hunted giant birds called moe.
In theory, the idea was then established that the Maori had migrated from Polynesia by the Grand Fleet and taken over New Zealand from Morior and established a farming society.
>>bos_Latn<< However, new evidence suggests that Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
In the Chatham Islands, there was another Maori tribe who emigrated from New Zealand.
There have been several skirmishes and ultimately the Moriori have been destroyed.
Individuals involved for several decades have helped us understand our strengths and passions and honestly assess shortcomings or even failures.
As we listened to individuals and their personal, family, and business stories, we gained significant insight into history and some of the personalities that influenced the organization's culture in good or bad ways.
While knowing your own history does not imply knowing the culture, it does help people gain a sense of their own place in the organization's history.
>>bos_Latn<< As they evaluate successes and realize failures, individuals and all participants discover the deeper values, mission, and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, the memories of previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and success that followed allowed people to be open to new changes and a new orientation of the local church.
Such success stories have reduced the fear of change and at the same time created positive tendencies towards change in the future.
Convergent thinking involves ways of solving problems that bring together different ideas and areas in search of a solution.
The focus of this way of thinking is speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the recognition of facts, the application of existing techniques and the collection of information.
The most important factor in such a metal assemblage: there is only one correct answer. You think of two answers, and that is right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this mindset think logically, can memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific research.
Humans are by far the most talented species when it comes to reading the minds of others.
This means that we can successfully predict what other human beings perceive, intend, believe, know, or desire.
Understanding other people's intentions is the most important of these abilities. It allows us to better understand the physical actions of others.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you would probably assume they were trying to steal a car.
He should have been judged differently if he had lost his car keys or if he was trying to break into his own car.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch of Stanford University and Edward Purcell of Harvard University.
In this resonance, atoms under the action of a magnetic field and radio waves emit tiny radiofrequency signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a physician and researcher, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for making medical diagnoses.
Four years later a patent was granted and it was the first patent in the world to be granted in the field of magnetic resonance imaging.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the assembly of the first full-body MRI scanner, which he called “Indomitable.”
Asynchronous communication gives you time to think and react.
It allows students to work at their own pace and manage the rhythm of receiving educational information.
Furthermore, there are fewer restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
>>bos_Latn<< The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows students access to information at all times.
>>bos_Latn<< Students can also send questions to the instructor at any time of the day and receive reasonably quick answers instead of waiting for the next meeting in person.
The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolute values. There is no one good way to learn.
Moreover, there is nothing that needs to be learned. Learning arises from the interaction of the student with the knowledge presented.
Our experience with DIY-based TV shows, presenting information and learning supports this view.
Most of us watch television shows that inform us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never overtake a car, build a fountain in the yard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor’s house.
Thanks to submarine fiber-optic cable connections to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has internet access.
The hotel or hosts (if you are staying in a holiday home or a private house) are likely to have a computer connected to wi-fi or the Internet, and all settlements have an internet cafe or some similar location with a publicly accessible wi-fi network.
>>bos_Latn<< "As already mentioned, although the word ""Eskimo"" remains acceptable in the United States, many peoples of the non-American Arctic consider it derogatory, especially in Canada."
>>bos_Latn<< While you might hear the natives of Greenland use the word, foreigners should avoid it.
>>bos_Latn<< The natives of Greenland in Canada are referred to as Inuit and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit) in Greenland.
"Crimes and bad intentions directed at foreigners in general are an almost unknown term in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "rough areas"."
Cold weather is probably the only real danger that will befall those unprepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold months (note that the climate is getting colder the further north you travel), it is necessary to bring enough warm clothes.
The long duration of a day in summer can cause sleeplessness and related health problems.
During the summer, Nordic mosquitoes should also be looked after. Although they are not carriers of the disease, they can be irritating.
Although the economy of San Francisco is associated with the fact that it is a world tourist attraction, its economy is diverse.
The largest sectors of employment are service activities, state administration, finance, trade and tourism.
Frequent appearances in music, film, literature, and popular culture have made the city and its landmarks famous around the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure that includes numerous hotels, restaurants, and top-notch convention venues.
Also, San Francisco is one of the best places in the state for Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
The trip to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
A typical visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel on the spot, a week-long stay without leaving the Disney estate, and a return home.
“There may be endless variations on the subject, but that’s still what people think of when they talk about ‘visiting Disney World.’
Numerous tickets sold online through auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used tickets for multi-day visits to parks.
Although it is a very common activity, Disney prohibits it: tickets are not transferable.
Any camping outside the Grand Canyon ring requires a permit.
Permits are limited to protect the canyon, and are made available on the first day of the month, or four months before the beginning of the month.
Accordingly, camping permits for any date in May are available from 1 January.
Free places for the most popular areas, such as Camp Bright Angel near Phantom Ranch, are usually filled on the very first day of booking opening.
"The number of available permits for people applying on the spot is limited and works according to the principle of "who first, his.""
Entering South Africa by car is a great way to see all the beauty of the region as well as to get to places that are not on the usual tourist routes.
This can be done in an ordinary car with careful planning, but 4 x 4 is recommended, and many locations are only available to cars with a large 4 x 4 wheelbase.
When planning, do not forget that the southern part of Africa is stable, but also that this is not the case for all neighboring countries.
Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country, and also depend on the country you come from.
Each country has unique laws that specify which first aid equipment must be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingston in Zambia and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, and they are the biggest attraction, but this popular tourist attraction for those looking for adventure and visitors provides numerous opportunities for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (from November to March), the amount of water is higher, so the waterfalls look more dramatic.
You will definitely get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails near the waterfall.
On the other hand, due to the large amount of water during this period, you will not be able to see the waterfalls themselves because you will be bothered by... water!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) is probably the most famous tomb in the Valley and is the site of the discovery of the almost intact site of the young king's ceremonial burial discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
Compared to most royal tombs, Tutankhamun’s tomb is hardly worth visiting because it is much smaller and has few decorations.
Anyone interested in evidence of damage to the mummy during the attempt to retrieve the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders can be seen.
The tomb’s incredible treasures are no longer found there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time are advised to spend time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. A temple on the hill was built in the late 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap are what makes climbing the hill worth the effort.
A visit to the site can be practically combined with a boat trip to the lake.
To enter the temple, you need an Angkor pass, so don’t forget to bring your passport when you head to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city in the Judean hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is considered sacred by the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Since Jerusalem, especially many sites in the Old City area, has religious significance, it is one of the major tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has a wealth of historical, archaeological, and cultural attractions, as well as lively and crowded shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.
Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive a written invitation before entering Ecuador at international airports or at border crossings.
>>bos_Latn<< Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs must legalize a letter that must comply with certain requirements.
These requirements were put in place for an organised migration flow between the two countries.
>>bos_Latn<< Cuban citizens who have a U.S. green card must visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of your travel. A round-trip ticket is required to prove the length of your stay.
Excursions are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are single or if there is only one person with you, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people to pay a lower price per person.
But in fact, you should not worry about this, because tourists are often moved to fill up the vehicles.
It seems to be a way of trying to convince people by fraud that they have to pay more.
This steep mountain rises over the northern edge of Machu Picchu, and often appears as a backdrop in photos of the ruins.
It looks scary from below and is a steep and difficult climb, but people with normal fitness should be able to make it in approximately 45 minutes.
Along most of the tracks are set stone stairs, and on the steeper parts steel cables serve as hand handles.
In view of all of the above, expect breath loss and watch out for steeper parts, especially if it is wet as it quickly becomes dangerous.
Near the top there is a small cave that you need to pass through, which is quite low and narrow.
Sightseeing of the Galapagos flora and fauna is best done by boat, just like Charles Darwin in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships cruise the waters of the Galapagos with 8 to 100 passengers each.
Most people book their place a lot in advance (since the boats are usually full in the high season).
Make sure that the agent through which you make a reservation is an expert in Galapagos and is well acquainted with many types of ships.
In this way, you will ensure that you select the most suitable vessel in accordance with your particular interests and/or limitations.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was ruled by the Incas while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche tribe was also one of the last independent Native American communities to not fully accept Spanish until Chile declared independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic wars that left Spain without a central government for several years), a decisive victory over the Spanish occurred only in 1818.
The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean state that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to the white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, it also houses the oldest European city in North and South America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first settled by members of the Taano tribe and the people of the Caribbean. The people of the Caribbean spoke the Arava language and arrived on the island about 10,000 BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, Spanish invaders had significantly reduced the population of Taino
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 members of the Tano tribe.
The space was built as an atrium for a 17th-century monastery, and the only remaining structure is the Templo de San Diego.
It now functions as a central square and there is always a lot going on in it, day and night.
Numerous restaurants surround the garden, and in the afternoon and evening free concerts are held in the central gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Kissing Alley). Two balconies only 69 centimeters apart are home to old love legends.

Bowen Island is a popular destination for a day trip or weekend getaway that offers opportunities for kayaking and hiking, as well as shops, restaurants and more.
This unique community is located in Howe Sound near Vancouver and is easily accessible by water taxi that regularly sails from Granville Island in lower Vancouver.
All those who enjoy outdoor activities should not miss a walk along the Sea to Sky corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) the rally is well known thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, enjoy one of the best ski experiences in North America, and in summer, try authentic mountain biking.
Permission must be obtained in advance. You must have permission to spend the night in Sirena.
Sirena is the only watchtower offering accommodation and meals in addition to the camping area. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping without meals.
Parking permits can be obtained directly at a ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue permits more than one month prior to scheduled arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for a fee of US$30 or US$10 for one-day passes. Details on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island state, a self-governing area of New Zealand located in Polynesia, in the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands covering 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
Because they are located in the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as "Austral Hawaii".
Although they are smaller, older visitors are reminded of Hawaii before gaining statehood, only without large hotels and other buildings.
There are no cities in Cook Islands, but it consists of 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries today, the offer of a luxury bed and breakfast has been brought to an almost artistic level.
Basically, restaurants that offer bed and breakfasts compete mainly in two things: bed and breakfast.
Accordingly, in the best such facilities can be found the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a hand-made bedspread or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies from the area or a host specialty.
The accommodation can be a historic old building with antique furniture, decorated foundations and a swimming pool.
A long journey in your own car is inherently attractive because of the simplicity that it carries with it.
Unlike larger vehicles, you’re probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limits.
Setting up a tent on private land or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, a car ride is great for outings, but it’s rarely a “camping” way in itself.
Auto-camping is possible if you have a large single-volume, SUV, sedan or caravan with seats on the descent.
Some hotels have heritage from the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners; before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
These hotels were frequented by the then rich and famous, and the offer often included fancy food and nightlife.
Old-fashioned installations, lack of the latest content and a certain graceful antique flair are also part of their character.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes host state rulers and other officials who come to visit.
A buyer with a pile of money might consider flying around the world and staying in many of these hotels along the way.
A guest network is an organization that connects travelers with the local population in the cities they visit.
>>bos_Latn<< To join such a network one usually needs to fill out an online form, although some networks offer or require additional verification.
A list of available hosts is then obtained in printed form and/or via the Internet, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded by programmer Casey Fenton in 2004 when he bought a cheap flight ticket to Iceland, but had no accommodation.
He sent an email to students at a local university and received an extremely large number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels primarily cater to young people; the typical guest is around 20 years old, but you can often come across older travelers.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow their stay in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the indoor ice competition.
Other ski events will take place at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival beginning in late November and running through mid-May, but this depends on the temple's annual calendar.
Most temple festivities are celebrated as part of the anniversary of the temple or the birthday of the deity to whom the temple is dedicated or some other major temple-related event.
Festivals in Kerala temples are very interesting, and include regular processions of decorated elephants, gigs in temples, and other festivities.
The World Fair (often referred to as the World Exhibition or simply the Exhibition) is a major international festival of art and science.
Participating countries in national pavilions set up art and educational exhibitions with the aim of demonstrating global issues or culture and history of their own country.
International horticulture exhibitions are specialized events where floral arrangements, botanical gardens and everything else that has to do with plants are presented.
Although in theory they can be held once a year (as long as they take place in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
These events usually last between three and six months, and take place on areas less than 50 hectares.
There are different formats of film that have been used for years. The most common is a standard 35 mm film (negative dimensions 36 times 24 mm).
You can pretty easily replenish your supplies if you run out of film, and the resolution is roughly comparable to that of a digital mirror-reflective camera.
Some medium format film cameras use a 6 x 6 cm format, specifically a 56 x 56 mm negative.
This provides almost four times the resolution of the 35mm negative (3136 mm2 compared to 864).
Wild nature is among the most challenging motives for a photographer and it requires a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wilderness photography is often taken for granted, but like photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wild photography often requires a long telephoto lens, although other lenses are needed for objects such as flocks of birds or tiny creatures.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and in parks there are sometimes rules about photographing for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise inaccessible.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, and more than twenty of them have over 50 million or more speakers.
The written word is also often more understandable than the spoken one. This is especially true of addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce clearly.
Often whole nations speak English fluently, and in an even larger number of countries you can expect limited knowledge, especially among the younger population.
Imagine the residents of Manchester, Boston, Jamaica and Sydney sitting at a table in a Toronto restaurant and having dinner.
They honor stories from their hometown, on their accents and local jargon.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without the ability to cook, the choice is limited to ready-made food.
More and more supermarkets offer a more diverse department of ready-made food. Some even have a microwave or other means of heating food.
In some countries or in some types of shops, at least one restaurant is located within the store premises, and this restaurant is often quite informal and prices in it are affordable.
Make and carry with you copies of your policy and contact details of your insurer.
The copies should show the insurer's email address and international telephone numbers for consultation/approval and submission of applications.
"Keep one copy in your luggage and one on-line (send it by email to yourself as an attachment or store it in a ""cloud")."
If you’re traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in memory or on disk (which you can access even when you don’t have internet access).
Give copies of the rules/contacts to travel companions and relatives or friends at home who are willing to help.
Moose (or deer) are not aggressive in themselves, but will defend themselves if they see a threat.
If people do not consider the moose potentially dangerous, they may get too close to it and put themselves at risk.
Consume alcoholic beverages moderately. Alcohol affects everyone differently and it is very important that you know where your limit is.
Possible long-term health consequences of excessive drinking may include liver damage, blindness and death. Potential dangers are growing from the consumption of illegally obtained alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain a variety of dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses are sometimes cheaper in foreign countries, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider having an eye exam at home, especially if you have insurance to do so, and take a prescription to confirm elsewhere.
The luxury brand frames available in such areas carry two possible problems: some may be copies, and the real imported frames may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most sought-after products, and probably many species exist in your region as well.
However, there are numerous ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
>>bos_Latn<< Canyoning (or canyoning) is the path to the bottom of a canyon, which can be dry or filled with water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping, and to engage in this activity, you need relatively little training and fitness (compared to, for example, sports climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of hiking in nature, often along hiking trails.
One-day hiking involves distances of less than a kilometer to larger distances that can be crossed in a day.
For a day trip on a light path, not much preparation is needed, and any person in average form can enjoy them.
For families with young children, more preparation is needed, but a day in the open air is possible even with infants and preschoolers.
Internationally, there are almost 200 tourist organizations for running. Most of them work independently.
The successor to Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, features dozens of tour service providers on four continents.
It takes its roots from Running Tours Barcelona from Barcelona and Running Copenhagen from Copenhagen, and there is Running Tours Prague based in Prague and other organisations.
There are many things to consider before and during your trip.
On trips, do not expect things to be "like at home". Customs, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language and the rest are to some extent different from those at home.
This is something you should always keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even disgust with local ways of acting.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for travel that goes beyond the limits of the traveler’s previous experience with nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to take over most regular reservations, many agencies specialize in certain types of travel, cheap travel, or destinations.
It is better to hire an agent who regularly book trips similar to yours.
See what trips the agent is promoting, either on the site or in the window.
If you want to travel around the world cheaply, either out of necessity, because of your lifestyle or as a challenge, there are ways you can do this.
Basically, they fall into two categories: either work while traveling or try to cut costs. This article deals with the latter.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to bring costs down to zero, take a look at travel with minimal costs.
The council stipulates that passengers do not steal, break in, participate in an illegal market, beg or otherwise use others for their own benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first point after disembarking from an airplane, ship, or other vehicle.
In some cross-border trains, checks are carried out when the train is on the move, so you should have a valid identity card with you on board.
In order to guarantee you uninterrupted sleep, a conductor can collect in night trains with a sleeping car of the passport.
Registration is an additional prerequisite for the process of obtaining a visa. In some countries, you need to report the presence and address at which you are staying to local authorities.
You may need to fill out a local police form or visit an immigration office.
In many states where such a law is in effect, local hotels will make a registration (make sure you ask for it).
In other cases, only those staying outside tourist accommodation must be registered. However, this makes the law even more vague, so ask in advance.
Architecture deals with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of the place is often a tourist attraction for itself.
Many buildings are really pleasing to the eye, and the view from a high building or a smartly placed window can really take your breath away.
Architecture overlaps significantly with other fields, including urban planning, construction, applied arts, interior design, and landscape design.
Given how far away many of the settlers are, you won’t find significant nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the above casinos serve drinks, and a few offer their own entertainment (mostly large casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Be on the alert: bars in small towns are not always a good idea for spending time when it comes to foreign visitors.
For one thing, the north of New Mexico is waging a hard battle against drunk driving, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small towns.
Unwanted murals or cicadas are called graffiti.
Although not a modern phenomenon, most people associate them with young people who destroy public and private property with spray paints.
"However, today there are distinguished graffiti artists, events associated with graffiti and ""legal"" walls. Images of graffiti in this context often look more like works of art than illegible markings."
Throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to master.
If you want to learn to throw a boomerang so that it comes back into your hand, you need a boomerang that comes back.
Most boomerangs in Australia don’t really come back. For beginners, it’s best not to try to throw when smoking
>>bos_Latn<< Hangi is cooked under earthen baking.
Bake heat from hot stones from the fire or in some places the ground is heated in a natural way by geothermal energy.
Hangi is often used for cooking traditional dinners in the style of baking.
Several restaurants in Rotorua offer a geothermal hangi, and other types of hangi can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes in passenger trains in Cape Town and the surrounding area: MetroPlus (also called first class) and Metro (also called third class).
MetroPlus offers a more comfortable way to travel with less crowds, but at a slightly higher price, although lower than the usual price of metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro wagons. MetroPlus wagons are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying for others - never let your bags out of your sight, especially if you are crossing international borders.
You could be carrying drugs without even knowing it, which would get you into a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line because drug detection dogs can be used at any time and without notice.
Some states have extremely draconian sentences even for the first offense, including prison sentences of more than 10 years and the death penalty.
Unsupervised bags are the target of theft and may also attract the attention of authorities due to suspected planted bombs.
At home, due to the constant exposure to local bacteria, there is a very high probability that you are already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where you don't know the bacteriological fauna, you're more likely to run into problems.
Also, in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Therefore, traveler's diarrheas such as the belly of Delhi, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge, and numerous other versions arise.
As is the case with respiratory problems in colder climates, digestive problems in hot climates are quite common and in most cases extremely unpleasant, but not very dangerous.
If you’re traveling to a developing country or a new part of the world for the first time, expect to experience a culture shock.
Many experienced and capable travelers are overcome by the feeling of being new when it comes to traveling to developing countries where a bunch of tiny cultural adjustments pile up in no time.
In the first days, especially consider paying tribute to Western style and quality hotels, food and services to help you adapt.
Don’t sleep on a mattress or on the ground in areas where you don’t know the local fauna.
If you plan to camp outdoors, bring a camping bed or a hammock to avoid snakes, scorpions, and the like.
In the morning, fill your home with a rich smell of coffee, and in the evening with a relaxing scent of chamomile tea.
If you spend your vacation at home, you have time to pamper yourself by taking a few extra minutes to prepare something special for yourself.
>>bos_Latn<< Those more daring can take the opportunity to make fruit juice or smoothies.
You may discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast after returning to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a variety of bars, you can visit a bar or pub in a neighborhood you don’t normally go to.
For those who are unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
The infectious disease is caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasites.
It is an infectious disease that is easily transmitted by staying near an infected person.
Many governments mandate that visitors entering the country and residents leaving the country are vaccinated against a number of diseases.
This often depends on which country the traveler has visited or intends to visit.
One of the advantages of the city of Charlotte in North Carolina is a handful of quality facilities designed for families.
Residents from other areas often argue that child-appropriateness is the primary reason for moving in and many visitors find it easy to enjoy the city with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly options in Charlotte’s central business district has grown exponentially.
Families in Charlotte usually do not use taxis, although they can be useful in certain circumstances.
In the case of more than 2 passengers, an additional fee is charged, so you may pay more for this option than you should.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive and require physical readiness. Tourists can only come in the summer from November to February and are mostly limited to the Peninsula, the Islands and the Ross Sea.
Several thousand employees live here in the summer in about twenty bases mainly in this area; a smaller number remain over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a ravaged plateau with an ice sheet 2-3 km thick.
Periodic specialized air tours go inland, for hiking or visiting the South Pole, on which there is a large base.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1,600 km long trail that leads from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It consists of compacted snow with filled cracks and markings. This road can be traveled only by specialized tractors and tractor sleds with fuel and supplies.
These means of transport are not very agile, therefore the trail long winds around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of winter accidents are slippery roads, sidewalks and especially stairs.
You need at least shoes with a suitable sole. Summer shoes usually slide on ice and snow, and even some winter boots are inappropriate.
>>bos_Latn<< The sample must be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material sufficiently soft in cold temperatures.
Some boots have crampons, and there are also nicknames with crampons for slippery conditions that are placed on heels or heels and poplars and are suitable for use with most shoes and boots.
Heels should be low and wide. Roads and roads are often sprinkled with sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) to increase friction.
>>bos_Latn<< Avalanches are not uncommon; the slopes can withstand little, and the excess leaves in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so its demolition always causes something else. The demolition of snow can in itself be the cause of new landslides.
Sometimes the original driving event is the warming of snow in the sun, sometimes snowfall, sometimes other natural phenomena, and often man.
A tornado is a vortex of very low pressure air, which sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They create strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
At first, they are like funnels that descend from storm clouds and then become “tornades” when they touch the ground.
Personal VPNs (virtual private networks) are a great way to bypass political censorship and commercial geofiltering by IP address.
They are stronger than network proxy servers for several reasons: they redirect all Internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
"Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of this, claiming they want to ""prevent copyright violations""."
In fact, regional codes have absolutely no effect on suppressing illegal reproduction; an identical copy of the disk can be reproduced on any device on which it is possible to reproduce the original copy.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it's all about the money.
Since calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use the phone company located in your place of residence or the place you are traveling to.
You’re not required to have a local number in the community you live in; you can connect to a satellite internet connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska, and pick a number that looks like you’re in sunny Arizona.
Often you will have to buy a special global number that allows PSTN phones to make a call to you. The location of the number is important to the people who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages that are on characters or other real-world objects when a user is pointing a smartphone at those objects.
Translation programs have advanced dramatically, so they often throw out more or less accurate translation (and less often nonsense), but care should be taken, because it is possible that the translation is completely wrong.
One of the most famous applications in this category is Google Translate which enables offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
Using a GPS navigation app on your smartphone can be the simplest and most convenient way to move outside your home country.
You can save money that you would spend on buying new GPS tickets or a standalone GPS device or renting from a car rental company.
If your phone does not have a data connection or is out of range, the effectiveness of the navigation device may be limited or the service may not exist.
Each neighborhood store is filled with a host of confusing phone cards that can be used in phone booths or with regular phones.
Although most cards allow calls by numbers anywhere in the world, some of them specialize in providing a favorable tariff of calls to certain countries.
These services can often be accessed via a free phone number that can be called from most phones without charge.
Simple shooting rules also apply to video recording, perhaps even more.
If shooting is not allowed, don’t even think about taking a video.
If you are using a drone, make sure in advance that it is allowed to record and what licenses or additional licenses are required.
Drone management near an airport or above the mass of people is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in your country.
Today, air travel is rarely booked directly through an airline unless it is first searched and compared prices.
Sometimes the same flight can have significantly different prices with different aggregators and it is worth comparing search results, as well as looking at the airline's website before booking.
Although you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries for tourism or business purposes, going in the role of an international student usually requires a longer stay than going in the role of a casual tourist only.
For a longer stay in a foreign country, it is usually necessary to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different application conditions and procedures than ordinary tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need a letter from the institution where you want to study, as well as proof of funds that will allow you to support yourself at least the first year of the course.
Check out the detailed requirements with the immigrant institution and office for the country you want to study in.
Unless you are a diplomat, working overseas usually involves reporting income tax in the country where you reside.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and classes vary greatly from one country to another.
In some states, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is collected at the federal and local levels, therefore rates and classes may vary depending on the region.
Although border checks are usually absent or a mere formality when you enter your home country, customs control can be a hassle.
Be sure to check what you can and cannot enter and report anything above the legal limits.
The easiest way to start writing about travel is to hone your skills on an existing travel site or blog.
When you learn how to format and edit posts on websites, you can also create your own page.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference in the world, but it’s not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know another culture and new people, learn about yourself, gain a new perspective and even learn new skills.
This can also be a good way to stretch the budget for a longer stay somewhere since many volunteer jobs offer accommodation and food, and some pay a small fee.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes continue to be used. Check if special permits are needed, which can be difficult to obtain.
The canal between the White Sea and the Baltic Sea connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onesha, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to navigate the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Be sure that once you get to the marina, everything will be quite obvious. You will meet other blind passengers on board who will share information with you.
You mostly post notices where you offer help, walk the piers, access people who clean their yachts, try to talk to sailors in a bar, etc.
Talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and guide you to the boat where they are looking for people.
You should carefully choose the airport in the alliance for the Frequent Flyer program for people who fly frequently.
While you may think it’s natural to join the airline you fly with most often, keep in mind that the benefits offered often differ and that you can receive more frequent flyer rewards than another airline from the same association.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services in Africa and offer connectivity to many major African cities at competitive prices compared to other European carriers.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you have extra time to travel, check the total cost of a trip to Africa compared to the cost of a trip around the world.
Do not forget to include the cost of making additional visas, taxes for leaving the country, ground transportation, etc. for all locations outside Africa.
If you want to tour the world by plane traveling entirely in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of ocean routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any).
However, Star Alliance covers all but the eastern southern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti as it is the domain of airline LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see below)
The Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, home to ethnic Armenians, fought a war against the Azeris in 1994.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic was created. However, no state, not even Armenia, officially recognized it.
Diplomatic disagreements over the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century district surrounding Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
It is an entire quarter on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its unique cultural and historical value, and property values are among the highest in the country.
"Cinque Terre, meaning "Five Countries", is the name for five small coastal settlements in the Italian region of Liguria: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso."
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people carefully built terraces on uneven, steep terrain up to the cliffs that loom over the sea.
Part of the charm is the lack of visible commercial development. Villages are connected by paths, trains and boats and cannot be reached from the outside by car.
The versions of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from French spoken in France, but are similar enough that their speakers can understand each other.
In particular, in French-speaking numerical systems in Belgium and Switzerland there are differences from French spoken in France and the pronunciation of individual words differs slightly.
However, all Belgians and Swiss who speak French are likely to have studied standard French at school so they might understand you even if you use a standard French numeral system.
In many parts of the world waving is a friendly gesture of greeting.
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malaysians in rural areas, this means "coming", similar to a forefinger bent towards the body - a gesture that is used in certain Western countries and should only be used for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may interpret waving in farewell to the waver (rather than to the waver) as a return gesture.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the intention of facilitating communication between persons who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are not the same as lingua franca, that is, natural or organic languages that for various reasons become the dominant means of communication between speakers of other languages.
On hot days, travelers can experience mirages that give the illusion of water (and others).
This can be dangerous if the traveler decides to go after the mirage and spends precious energy and remaining water on it.
Even the warmest desert can become extremely cold at night. Coldness is a real danger if you do not have warm clothes.
In the summer, you should pay special attention to mosquitoes if you go for a walk through the rainforest.
Even as you drive through the subtropical rainforest, it is enough to open the door for a few seconds as you enter the vehicle for mosquitoes to enter it.
Bird flu or more formally bird influenza can also infect birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most involved people working with poultry, but there was also some risk for birdwatchers.
For Norway, steep fjords and valleys are typical, which suddenly pass into high, more or less equal plateaus.
"These highlands are often referred to as ""vidde"", meaning a wide, open space without trees, a vastness without borders."
"In districts Rogaland and Agder are commonly referred to as ""hei"", meaning a swampy area without trees most often under heat."
Glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This can cause cracks and chasms that can be obscured by snowbanks.
The walls and roofs of the ice caves can collapse and the cracks can close.
At the edge of the glacier, huge chunks can be detached, dropped, and perhaps moved or rolled away from the edge.
The tourist season in mountain stations in principle reaches its peak during the baby summer.
However, mountain stations are distinguished by a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter. Many of them are then covered with decent amounts of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few more airlines are offering prices for mourners, which are slightly lowering the price of last-minute funeral trips.
Some of the airlines that offer this are Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, and WestJet.
In any case, you must make a reservation by phone call directly with the airline.
