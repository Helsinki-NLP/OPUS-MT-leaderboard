Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they "look like Muppets"
Some of the Members of the Assembly are dismayed by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation from across the political spectrum are concerned that it may be subject to ridicule.
One Member of Parliament from the Labour Party said his party is concerned that it is "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means "fool/crazy", and pwp means "how".
A Plaid member said that the party as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party is "free-spirited" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "muppet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The committee of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any words by which the members of the assembly will be appointed will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government Act gave the Wales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals indicating great support for naming the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the name issue of the Members of Parliament, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may cause headaches for the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes to the assembly's way of working, including rules for disqualification of assembly members and design for the committee system.
Members of the assembly will cast the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Quieted as Churches in Harlem Face Trouble
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is neither."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go regularly".
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place from which they began".
The churches, he added, could be replaced with apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and therefore the day will speed up when these churches close completely because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A congregation of blacks practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a congregation of blacks during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but because members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the inexperienced leaders of the church, and part of the episcopal diocese.
The Church Board - the church's governing body, made up of non-expert leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "require costs to be transferred" to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old child while diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, on the opening day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 p.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he first thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then "he realized that he was yelling, 'It bit me!
It bit me!”
His whole collarbone was visible," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
"I got used to everyone coming out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, he is listed as being in critical condition.
It is not known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but decided that the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the Ponto beach side in Casablad to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty shelves full of professional helpers.
As part of a significant entry into the 2.8 billion pound beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will also be featured in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of shelf space once intended for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty assets for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up series, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Cradon, south London, last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis at local stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to split profits from chemical asset stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for ?125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-see destination for the beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million-pound deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million pound contract with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of Truly for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is affiliated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old said on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retiring from their lucrative brand lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant she no longer had time to devote to their brand of Truly for products and household accessories.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated to be $11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, told Instagram she was leaving Truly, Jones hastily left Britain for one of his cottages.
One source said: "Truly has always been at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long-term future that would follow in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
At Marlow headquarters there is a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's programmer, who is one of Britain's highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in pillow and candlestick products, up to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity (I'm a Star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We don't comment on his business exploits".
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making comments that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do so many things?
Trump said with his voice disguised as a "news presenter".
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see an "appropriate response" from the United States on North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We agree with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now we have this great collaboration."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - he had completed missile tests, helped free hostages and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island and kills hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no natural disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that are constantly affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best time, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims has headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's main point in the election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starage from Liverpool team tied against Chelsea
Daniel Starage saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri passed the ball to Staridge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–2.
He shifted the ball to the left before directing it to the far post.
The ball moved high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed over the jumped Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shack are always passing as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Staridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just kicked".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The "blues" striker pitched heeled back to Matteo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half pitch, and then sprinted across to Liverpool's waist.
They quickly scored with Kovačić in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the net on the far leg with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused 20-foot-high waves, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho agency spokesman said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a shot from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with Grayson Moves' stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who had seen or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would ask people who have been near John Street in Birkenhead, who have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and had been found in a facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as police have said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moves had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that he was not allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they could return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that now the entire area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
She keeps repeating "it's so awful".
At 2 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another was outside.
Numerous police officers stood in the cordon and watched the flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 quoting entry 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the latest memory blow in the quarrel over "rewriting history"
Its persecution would be poetic justice for its "taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts performed by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said, "In the present debate over the removal of statues it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell before the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more in the late years of the 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation is a subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Killer Pig Slaughtered and Killed a Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with his artery ripped off, covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in Liupanshui in Gizou Province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to place swine vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with a cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pigsty.
He stated that there was a large boar with blood on its snout in the cocoon.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound boar tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, given the surname "Wu", according to a quote in Guyang's evening news.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market executives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife had driven the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood may act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across cold waters on Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rain flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5.00am Eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to bring in large tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create heavy rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause flash flooding, a flow of rubble, and possible landslides in the desert.
The large tropical humidity will cause precipitation that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert in the event of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local torrential rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than half an inch in total is possible, which can cause rivers of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread into the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperature are expected everywhere in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropics remain with high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October with high temperatures in 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our forecast for the longer term indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the deadlocked political situation continued, with announcers interrupting regular last-minute turnaround programs from Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, drew up an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was performing the piano and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to the other networks they featured, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people looking in offices.
To show it better, it is an audience of a size similar to a playoff game in football or the film academy awards.
Fox News, whose anchors strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led the way for all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him being yelled at by protesters on Friday morning as he was trying to get into an elevator for the trial committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was reprimanded, all of which was broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "you have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominee next week, which were asked by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and with several senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the mutual costs was "completely absurd".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditheon Simson over Louisiana State University athlete's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Ditheon Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, said a WAFB partner on CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The Department thanks the Louisiana State Police's Refugee Unit, the State Police's Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and area citizens for the help they provided in the investigation leading to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for its "activity in the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20.
The 6.6-foot quarterback grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 catch balls per game in his last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" by Sims' death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," the coach said.
A volcano has spewed ash on Mexico City.
The ejection of ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to head for the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City's populated areas, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote to secede from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used batons to suppress fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and on the other side union protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low due to a boycott by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia had a chance of gaining independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-elected exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, filming the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before a trial last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Man arrested after driving car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been caused to the gate and the structure itself.
At some point it may have been shot by a crossbow to the car.
Menga's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured a win
The forward Livingstone trailed the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side remained without a guest win in the championship this season and will face leaders Harts next week, behind behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue unbeaten in the division over the course of six games, and Coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they gave the goal, and their directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts from afar after playing Craig Halkett's head shot over the goal with a slide.
Guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the set actions.
And that’s exactly how the goal came to be.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingstone got an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who only gave a touch-off goal from the center of the sixteen.
Until that point the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the hosts' defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not play for the most part.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos elicited a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow took the ball away from another set action at Livingston.
Livingstone's sixteenth was passed over and defended repeatedly, while two penalty requests - after Halkett's challenge for Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand-to-hand play - were denied.
"Phenomenal" by Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this uphill trail.
Their style and character of play hardly changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral on alert.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard's leadership, they are now falling behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak - only once did they manage to open the hosts - and it's a small reawakening of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Kolonja
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Colonia to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protesters reflect the divisiveness of a visitor famed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died after a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a high-traffic road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred months after the death of another cyclist in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been set up and buses have been diverted and it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots at the men's prison with a high level of security, the prison's office said.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which involve eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the Public Order and Peace Police were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (may be beneficial for arid areas)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert’s southwestern region, bringing a risk of flash flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, as far as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and United Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile range of Phoenix since 1950!
Katharine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the edge of Arizona's Mongolon.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated sites up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are out of risk areas for flash floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Sushi Monitoring Authority, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second-highest category," said weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over Mexico's Lower California peninsula.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of maximum 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and is decreasing.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the severity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant flood risk.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," Weather.com said.
Rosa would then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah by the late evening hours of Tuesday.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora, and the desert southwestern region of the United States," said the State Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and torrential rains, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton at around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have requested that if anyone has mobile phone records of the incident, step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the most outrageous and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassie Ford's accusations of having sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and about her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality, and courage" that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the significance of Republican turnout in early elections.
Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first key vote on Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, total death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves measuring 6m (18ft) hit the shore at sunset, taking many to certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the BNPB agency's spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shot of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came around the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the upper floors of a building screaming frantic, warning people on the street below about a tsunami approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water rammed ashore, bringing buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they went through scenes of devastation along the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses being destroyed," he said.
It's too bad.
Even as aid groups began grim attempts to start aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies, and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can receive international aid, but it has not yet status."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been pinned under the shot for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who are stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, when the news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate in the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray tick sign, rather than a son.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM at Newport on the quayside.
Thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was supplementing an ATM at Newport's Pier, according to a Newport Police Station press release.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man "run from behind a Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Yej
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Yay.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old West was nicknamed Yey for a time and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just before his visit on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He would replace singer Ariana Grande on the show who had to cancel for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
“I think ‘yee’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that’s where ‘you’ means,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am you, I am you, I am you.
It went from Kanye, which means the only, to Yay only, reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pee Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a hyphen and all capital letters.
Mexico's Amlo vows not to use military on civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double its research funding in the field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next big achievement in the field of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI+ Fa companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American othello player, and later served as a director at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked for previous contests after the U.S. government's technology as the challenge in robotics to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next contest would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard in order to receive state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think 'green cards' should automatically be offered to doctors of science in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organizations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of the work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the establishment of an Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission had not taken effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its EU and NATO membership bids.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and vetoes its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ticket read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Ljoše Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "yes" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes all Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overtook Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass midfield at the start of the sequence.
He passed quickly between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
He bypassed one defender before rushing several others to the edge of Brighton's sixteenth.
He then passed to his left, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first coming to the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot, with a single kick in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score at that point."
But the initial advantage of the "sky blues" gave Sterling in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before leading Sterling to the distant tripod.
The "heavenly blue" attack got the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to stand in the center square on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for a playoff for the Rockies team, who lead by one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies' team had at least a "joker" for a place with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be played at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals are still scheduled to announce a launcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for the 34th time, trained a pitch on Thursday and will pitch normally rested on Sunday.
Washington's right field is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big ones, the big one - I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means at their disposal, you see the meanness, the rudeness.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what power and control want, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, mean, obnoxious, and untruthful."
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the Democrats, set up by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with shouts of outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Ah, what.
No, no, I wait a minute - it was very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer accepting different opinions.
It is not acceptable to those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the line of members of parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome - just because it expresses its opinion.
My fellow-parliamentarian Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she takes a determined stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed on with previous leaders.
An announcement about the meeting of Nottingham's Eastern Labour Party stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party's parliament, Friday night council meetings were just that.
Unfortunately today, that is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "softer, gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if indeed, ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly evident that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the Party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared similar political opinions began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never have otherwise taken, whether it was for national security or for the EU's internal security.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there follows a critical social media harassment that calls for condemnation, denial of the center's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
In fact, I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with each request for "no trust" or change in selection rules, the party becomes with narrower opinions.
I've received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud and then "everything will be fine".
But that’s not why I’m in politics.
As early as 32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government that literally left my classroom collapsing, I struggled to improve public services for those in need, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s request, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how damning threats or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I consider to be in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Air goes to the top
The two late points may have altered the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match of the day from the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeaten side out of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which the home team took, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Praise for Ear, they made better use of their chances than we did".
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to improve on the numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Ear's lead by a penalty, earlier, right at half-time, he scored a point, so converted a solo point to score 17-5 for Ear in the save.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Andresson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long hold-up due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was taken out on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford McDowall's point converted by Klimo.
Ear's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with Bruce Colvin's unconverted point at the end of time with relentless pressure.
But the home team rebounded and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to shoot down Klimo without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line at the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's shot and sent winger Gregor Henry towards the fifth point for the home team.
'Still Game' Star Looks Ready for New Career in Restaurant Industry
Still Game's star, Ford Kiran, appears poised to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be their last, and it looks like Kirnan is planning for a life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
'The Sea Is Ours': Bolivia Surrounded by Land Hopes Court Will Reopen Path to Pacific
Sailors are patrolling a covert-laundering naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are embroidered with the motto: “The sea is ours.
It's our duty to get it back."
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may be the biggest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on Oct. 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course it expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign sea exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends heavily on Monday’s verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he solemnly declared in late August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor and won't change much even to rule in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant territory to Chile and has said it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The international court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments suggest the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert in international law from Chile.
And the last four years may well have set the Bolivian cause back instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian official in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday would bring Bolivia an "incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also dismissed that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the sea problem as a political foothold.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't achieve nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "fiction" to consider that extended U.S. sanctions and objections to a declarative end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your cap collection or completely block out the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of freaky oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The highly impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations eye-popping down the runway.
The piece highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide feather-shaped rim that flooded the model's head.
Other oversized accessories included zircons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but they aren’t designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment entirely with glasses and a diving tube, and another looked like melted cornet ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats may come to stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the straw hat with a two-foot-wide rim worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that has spread across social media has sent another big creation down the runway, a straw beach bag almost the size of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia board and a white leather handle, was the piece featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer has caused so much impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam scores, which only reinforces with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement customized school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will make him conceited.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can note that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade of "5+".
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission noted that of the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what career one chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today's children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important in the UK when looked at in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
At present, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be replicated in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
"Il faut bien le faire" (that must be done).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to take Lakers to San Diego on Sunday
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first game of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play, has not yet been decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that James would likely play a limited time.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers' season.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has launched a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies next week, including visits to favored places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to confirm his election to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans may lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Time zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address a hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of misconduct of a sexual nature with an expected delay of up to a week in the Senate as the FBI investigates.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Scheduled to the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday marks Trump's second visit to West Virginia in a month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed courage in the fight to keep hope alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the Saturday afternoon fours may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The twist of luck is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such games.
Who do you think happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're a little lucky I guess," said Jordan Spit after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage of, of course, a four-point lead and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spite, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails, although they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spite and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spit was excellent and leads by example.
Those loud cheers of celebration grew louder throughout his game, with a key kick that led to a four-to-four tie when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His shot that won the game at 15 was greeted with a similar shout, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to go deeper and take care of your match," Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for any player.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe are four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Mollywood" were the only pair without bad beats on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad beats on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the previous nine on Friday mornings.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players that will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will secure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nacional, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
The two are preferred at the same time on different holes.
However, talks about European fame remain unjustified.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly tackled Sergio Garcia, the morning doubles hero, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A misfire and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never managed to get out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Doubles and quadruples are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t follow, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead on the final day, but the four-way season also showed that the U.S. team could fight though some, especially Americans, doubted.
The Europeans led 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins as Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf Nacional on four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which struggled to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team, which had many misses in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend are the second pair ever to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After "crushing" Woods and Patrick Reid into doubles they played great and beat worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deshambu by an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods who slipped through two matches on Saturday, at times played great, but now lost 19 of 29 doubles and fours matches and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henrik Stanson's partner in the fours with a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all for their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-pointer for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the doubles and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McLroy 4&3 in fours, but lost on the starting, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a certain team recovered from a four-point shortage in an individual game, although as title holders, Furik's team was tied enough to retain the trophy.
After being second for two days, however, the weekly counterattack looks set to stay over them.
North Korea says 'no way' to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepened mistrust in the United States and there was no chance the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities, and committing against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response on the part of the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to disarm unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump gave a guarantee of North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to yield to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament above all else' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal by coercion or even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a pipe dream for people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader outlined at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles toward the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile" with a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, much to Kim's praise for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, stating "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, "Security Council sanctions must continue completely and without exceptions until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to impede the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea after only a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to disarm a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore, as well as moves to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho-culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, is designing the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm where students press on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another section, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then prompts participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chaisler.
A culture of pride with "working all night" still exists, he said, and moreover modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after taking one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted from electronic screens and the LED light, which displaces the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal ousted Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerard's scrambled team into a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to register their first win since a 4-1 February triumph at St Johnstone's, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as manager leaving his team eight points behind the deluded Harts leading team in the Scottish First League.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers' lineup lost inspiration and chances of leveling up.
Now the Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingstone climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
There may be additional problems awaiting Rangers after line judge Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after being apparently hit with a long-range object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Aer in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, played with Livingston's same 11 who scored a point with Hearts last week and would have been delighted in the way his well-trained lineup choked opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated possession over the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score, two minutes into the game when Menga's first play put Scott Pittman through to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then a long-range kick by Keehan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only play outright in the defence.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but referee Stephen Thomson gave no sign of approving the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to score two shots towards the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not make it past Lasana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovi Edaria's weak kick.
Although Livingston's 34th minute start may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' strike.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during halftime when he replaced Coolabaly with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingston were able to attract guest players to play a type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Hackett catching many of the long passes.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and stopped Jacobs from playing head after corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another penalty request after clashing with Jacobs, but Thomson again disapproved.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday in the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and WE CHOOSE ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then it has become a majorstay of science, the Geiger counter has also become a majorstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Colorado's Bells, featuring those seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms releasing radioactivity into the minerals."
Evans: "Say it, it must be jumping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to 'watch' stray cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to 'watch' stray cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in a laboratory
They can "see" protein common in many types of cancer and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine delivers promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognise abnormal cells, had ovarian cancer gone in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein common in many types of cancer called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells works when treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outburst, wearing a cap with his motto, after performing live on Saturday night.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing a third song that night called Ghost Town, wearing a cap that read “Make America Famous Again,” he began to criticize Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee related to allegations of sexual assault of Christine Blacy Ford.
Although not broadcast, the footage of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty getting behind the scenes because of his cap.
“I was laughed at behind the scenes.
They told me "don't show up with that cap".
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sinking place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the sunken place?" he said he would "put his superman-drop, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
His comments drew outcry from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show looked embarrassed, Varayetti reported, one man told the publisher: "The whole studio is muted".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with a performance of the song "I Love That", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPSAD group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR VOTING TO THE TOOL".
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful".
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kaine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lyon and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist from previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington lashes out at toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype when he stated that such on-screen roles meant that young boys often felt they had to be tough to be respected.
In a statement for the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said that he believes "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #NowIsay era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" on the issue.
"Personally, I have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?," he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street, that makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because obviously there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in Game of Thrones sequels when the series ended next summer, saying that "it ended with battles and horses".
As of November, Keith will be performing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love appeal with Keith's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Because of the country's conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data presented by a staff member related to a Republican Party senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff leaked the personal information of three Republican senators in the United States to Wikipedia's lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were of "ultra-right" sympathisers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly includes a home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday, released by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while a Senate panel was in session for a hearing on allegations of misconduct of a sexual nature against Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for Supreme Court justice.
The information came shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate have reported that an IP address identifying the source of the announcement has been linked to Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff has been released, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate allegations are completely false and are an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in a midterm election, also took to Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed "competent institutions and police of the false claims.
"We will make it possible for offenders to be detected," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
Opinion of Johnny English Attacks Again - undermined Rowan Atkinson's spy scams
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new British-related film, and this seems to apply to this renewal of Johnny English's rogue action comedy franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will careful self-mocking of the topic of how obviously we suck be the new export opportunity the nation has?
Despite everything, the face with big eyes and a lot of grimaces of the incompetent Johnny English was given a license to "stop" things for the second time - his name above all signifies that he is a comic creation of wide scope, made for viewers in cinemas in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour, looks a bit like Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bean and a part of the boy playing a note from the song Chariots on Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Its basis is the traveller and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclays' now-forgotten TV ad, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's freakish mishaps are not as inventive and focused as the mute stunts of Atkinson's character Bean.
The theme is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
At the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and is already suffering from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best in this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling in Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a private school, but "in black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is hastily called to Whitehall for an urgent briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in reference to a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all things in the Royal Secret Service return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; wreak havoc after smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a veritable anarchy when he attempts to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All brakes have been removed for the final sequence, but as polite and noisy as it is, there is plenty of children's TV in the entire film.
Nice moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will use his talent?
Labour denies planning for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "fits" with the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be favoured by workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking party member told the Sunday Times: "A strategy review should be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that is consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labor Party will not be the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party has advocated for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not been accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not the party's strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of "faceless directors" and "profitors" in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole piece back because a Labour government could make "deductions" because of unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the boards of companies and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds with which 10 percent of private firms' capital will go to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy make a statement to "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week and has raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out and I said "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, looks carved in stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," added Graham, referring to Christine Blaysey Ford.
"Everyone she named couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; ending poverty.
It is now being held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn of the central park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or some other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Goalball Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to persuade people to ask to take action or just another case of "click-activism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, who acted for many different purposes.
They say these actions have helped spur world leaders to forge commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and hints resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key pledges are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, committed to "helping children use their potential", which has pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda for help with malnutrition in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens alike, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history," Ambassador Tracy Ullman of Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Ishranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of their website's frequently asked questions, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen said: “It’s going to be a long and hard road - we’re never going to make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to ‘block’ Russian energy exports
Washington can "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria - namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a front for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy trading, just like they are doing in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, by blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed attendees at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as "one awkward pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to deviate from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's firm opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance met resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will 'carefully consider' whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman at the helm," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a town hall meeting and said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is outspoken in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as a Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a message on Twitter on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent against.
Other Democratic nominees are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic Trek Palin syndrome at Donald Trump rally
Trek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my son has been going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I know how other families who are torn apart by the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "they come back a little different, they come back fortified, they come back and wonder if there's respect for what they and their Air Force buddies have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a female person, along with a report of domestic violence and gun possession under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Vasila Police Department.
18 states and the city of Washington support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen U.S. states and the city of Washington support challenging a new U.S. policy that prevents asylum-seeking victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition with the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang", had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state attorney general representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a number of U.S. asylum claims originated, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 immigration complaint board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of passing laws at the state, federal and international levels."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and such provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that the policy preventing immigrants from entering is detrimental to the American economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said at a policy launch on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to be the solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
Residents return to their dilapidated homes and choose from their irrigated items, to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about China Daily's paid supplement in Des Moines Register - Iowa's top-selling newspaper - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, China denied the charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked a merger for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they level import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was aimed at exporters from states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former, longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles the harassment with propaganda ads in our free press."
"In disseminating propaganda, the government of China abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“By contrast, in a nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see the true reflection of the desperate opinions the Chinese people may have about China’s problematic economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party’s firm hand,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are moving away from women's votes ahead of midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
With many Republicans mutely watching or defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm election.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already declared that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no turning back," wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell faculty at the University of Syracuse, about Hill, in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that pressure to investigate the FBI on Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaysey Ford, Mick said.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be high," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site, said.
“People already say they’re tall; that’s true.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court justice candidate, analysts suggested there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue voting.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to be heard, it's also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided over who to trust after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, though a larger number accept the first-mentioned side.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying when testifying, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one by Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court candidate of showing her genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on the open source platform Solid, by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "data warehouse on the Internet" or abbreviated POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data store on the Internet is that it is only up to the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
Inrapt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process, and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developer developers with a contract to work on the project and a community of coders-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete overhaul where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Medium post, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Wide Web, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm a big optimist for the new era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross-bearer since World War I
The only Church of England priest to receive a Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, the Honourable Bernard Vann received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military decoration.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was an "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "Through very thick fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the shooting sites and with "greatest courage" led forward, before attacking a gun nest himself and incapacitating three of the servicemen.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Wan said he was "greatly honoured to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, got Pepa Pig instead
Imagine being up all night watching Bellator 206, not being able to watch the main event.
The San Jose roster contained 13 fights, including six with the main card shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Moussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel switched to Pepa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake until the early hours because of the struggle.
One of the fans on Twitter described switching to a children's cartoon filly as "some painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
“Pepa Pig,” yes.
Company president Bellator Scott Kuker said they would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I think about re-release, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But it is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages during the transfer, and none of them were kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number to five fights, instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to deliver more for the sake of the fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone's not like me"
Speaking on Radio 4's first show Disks on a Desert Island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-time show Kirsty Young, took a multi-month vacation due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of lower worth and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned of his sexuality.
The two-bronze Olympian became a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked them was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you won't be here to be in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - which was swirling in his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he still thrived.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mickelson, con not in shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to change form to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furrick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the five-time winner, he divided the time to cheer and rehearse on his game, on the range, in the hope of fixing what silenced him.
He has never been the best leader, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf Nacional course, where distant rough shots are a regular punishment in case of inattention.
And if the pitch itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game of the week, faces the exacting champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who is playing paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are missing four points before 12 individual games, start hard, Mickelson's game may be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see otherwise.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is part of the celebrities and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went like that, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He likes to play, like everybody else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career where he has never achieved the best results of his individual career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost games and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's resourceful, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Dane made his debut at a game at Valderrama in 1997, when a guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead ahead of the Americans, but "crossed the finish line only with the noses", with a minimum lead of 141–2-131/2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, when we lost at Valderrama, when we won for a bit," Bjorn said, figuratively, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf Nacional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Get out there and play it right.
This is not over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players on our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added, pleased with the results of his players on a difficult golf course: "I don't want to give premature grades on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We're expecting individual games tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It is great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then all abilities as a golfer are tested.
That's the message to send to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furrick will require players to play better individually than they played in doubles, exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the last day's changes, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle games.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is given the task of opposing first and facing Rory McLroy the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the guys because I think we will cover everything," Bjorn said of the selection in the individual games.
New German warship delayed again
The German navy's newest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year because of faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Falz, the flagship of the new class of frigates Baden-Wittemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014 but the troubled issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Witemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is less frequent maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships - which are supposed to allow Germany to have power across the oceans - will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The frigate with unfortunate fate F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Witemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was drastically above planned weight which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Falz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
Aside from the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial $2.2 billion.
The problems facing the newest frigates are particularly important because of warnings of Germany's declining naval strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was "running out of ships that can be deployed".
The official said the problem worsened over time, as the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Witemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A new survey of property in the Scottish Highlands is being conducted to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the findings will provide answers to the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide protection activities in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as long-eared brown bats and daubenton bats at Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at NBC, hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important for bats and how each of the species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect beds and habitat loss.
Winds and lights also pose a risk, as do sticky fly strips and some chemical treatments of building materials, as do domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which oversees more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, bedside inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve on the Trive property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is ideal territory for them.
"Here at Trive we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there's a lot of unknown stuff about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes that it is important to check if there are bats before property renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of litters can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Protection Trust encourages the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don't know how they live."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations and lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly then paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video to its 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no.
What was presented today is fake news," the five-time winner of the gold ball told his camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well" added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "inadmissible transmission of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage in addition to an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the court in the Clark area of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good boy", but relented below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the Police and pictures of her injuries were taken to a hospital, but later agreed to a plea bargain without court participation because she was afraid of reprisals" and was worried "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to amend the treaty because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and moved to Italian giant Juventus this summer with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will 'always regret' losing carmakers
Britain will "always regret" losing its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, close to Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japan’s carmaker says the impact of a no-deal Brexit will cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a production stoppage at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in Britain have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade would work when leaving the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-M-We, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what carmakers call logistics chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates under a "right on time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars as ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could cause delays and parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily supply of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "correctly made to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only to succeed in enjoying the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told today's programme on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union's representative at the factory, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to one government spokesman: "We have put in place a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight continues over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential violations of laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Miller's independence has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a recording device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blaysey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on "Fox News Sunday".
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be held this week and it could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things go and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since September 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to a distaste for the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is organizing more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence, "We have reviewed those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States questions, it's far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do that more often and you are witnesses that we have been doing it repeatedly over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working in Scotland’s national health system about Brexit fears.
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers working in Scotland’s national health system expressing his country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal have continued throughout the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of a no-deal outcome.
I know this period is very upsetting for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the workforce, regardless of his citizenship.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are beneficial to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the defensive player (linebacker) of the Tennessee State Tigers underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury at the game on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to the Tennessee Organ.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just collapsed to the ground," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put him in a stretcher and took him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/grade of the injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a sophomore and plays his first season in a red jersey at Tennessee State following a transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before exiting the game, resulting in a total of 18 tackles being made this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralize Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, funds that will be used to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move would be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on non-tax-paying individuals and firms in the UK, with the additional funds stepping up government efforts to improve the situation of the homeless.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-UK residents, leading to price increases and causing difficulties for first-time buyers to engage in the process.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of offering high property prices thus retaining the land but not using it and asked Mrs May to change quotas for affordable homes in order to remedy the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending evictions without just cause.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream, that is, to making life better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in as easy a way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning one's own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless persons too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to govern Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland said his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently ranks third in the top division with only three points short of the top team.
This summer he moved to the "Stage of Light" after bringing the St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told the BBC's Scottish "Sportsound".
"But I grew up constantly seeing Scotland in 'Hampden' with my father and always something was pulling me back.
However, I can only get such an opportunity if I am successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing he should follow such established names in such a large club, after having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is judged by 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities at this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get this club there, but I will probably consider that I have only achieved success here if I bring the club back there."
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years, a career he entered after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped "Alloa" recover from being relegated to the third league and brought "St. Mirren" back from the brink of losing the Championship title in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played in "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls of taking on "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, earning enough from it, and enjoying certain high benefits.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I do, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever throughout my adult life."

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consultancy services in establishing these figures said, "The sunny weather and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when profits at the pubs increased by 2.8 percent and at the restaurants significantly decreased.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened further during July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly sold saw a much larger increase compared to previous years than restaurants where a decline was noted.
Pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, although not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by just three percent.
Paul Newman, holiday and hospitality analyst for RSM said, "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It’s not at all surprising that restaurants continue to be in a difficult situation, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales over the course of a year will be particularly devastating in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the localities where food is mostly sold and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the release of new brands.
The UK’s Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined revenues of more than 9 billion pounds and is an established benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they have one "master" profile that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create a social media profile that hides it from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" profiles, short for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "master" profile that they showed to their parents, while also having other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter came across a teenager asking others to "rape" him.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secretive to them.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of "Scottish Athletics"
Elid Doyle has been elected non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those in the lead in the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletics community has tremendous respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit tremendously if she became a board member," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help guide the sport in Scotland properly."
The American who won the 200m and 400m titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to winning a total of four gold medals at the Olympics and who now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
The whole process was laborious, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again and do exercises for agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows caused a division of opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company sparked a split on the internet when it ran an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s quietest breast pump,” user-centric tech company Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom the new pump provides to breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay to a song whose lyrics sound like this: "Yes, I milk milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't udders, these are my breasts."
Continues the refrain: "Pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts."
However, the ad, which was posted on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It's a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, should get pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are stolen from them after only a few days after they give birth," one of the comments read.
The "Elvie" breast pump discreetly fits into the nursing bra ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads as follows: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Really inappropriate advertising."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she felt the song was really "ridiculous."
“I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still milking.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's an ingenious product," read one of the comments.
Another commented, "This is a fun advertisement designed for mothers who milk (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like 'cows.'"
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while the discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes, and discreetly fits into the nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while milking the milk.
Anna Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother commented, "Elvie's pump is truly a revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between milk-milking women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring milk to the pump and the challenges it brings to the spotlight, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the "Elvie" pump has been present in all titles.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly, though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves and feared jeopardizing their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we continue to prosecute those individuals," Mr Albens said.
In order to speed up child cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard read.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become agitated and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where its size is more likely to be overlooked signs that a child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria under the pretext of taking part in the fight against terrorism and would be "treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing the question of what should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump will win the 2020 election again unless impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberals are likely to hope for.
In what will no doubt be "The most dramatic presidency finale ever seen!"
As seen from now, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the rating in prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million in "CNN" and almost tripled to 1.6 million in "MSNBC".
Nielsen says that Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up 1.7 million from the period four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show reached the top cable ratings with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is reported.
“It’s like a fire that people feel drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Baer, ABC’s chief television producer of the drama, “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovel, comedy veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, 'Because I find him really funny,'" Mrs Scovel told me.
There's also some fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, of whether immigrant families can be reunited, and of the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been watching for six hours a panel of experts debating the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear," a $15,000 Paul Manafort-skin bomber jacket ("clothes of thick arrogance," as Danielle called it, "the Washington Post's shock") and the implications of Trump's portrayals "The Washington Post."
I will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he does and what gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show is that it brings you something new every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's rotating show crew and everyday twists (NFL brawls, praises for Kim Yong-un).
You can’t miss a single episode because you won’t be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on Kauai's north coast, but he was locked inside and watching "MSNBC" while filming on "CNN".
He couldn't stop watching, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people were saying 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign funds in the tightest mid-term elections in the race for the Upper House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts from which there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is being run by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the snap election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old districts were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, which contradicts the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough campaign finance contest among the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee ("DCCC") and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee ("NRCC").
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March 18th congressional district election, which was characterized by wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, the seat has been held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. decides to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then quits
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump in June 2017 had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokesman in a statement she made earlier this month.
But only El Salvador received US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading for the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials stressed they wanted the conference to progress and effectively end any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attributes to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that may happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently a lot of hard evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is connected to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor to his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed at that and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What do we do if Mr. Trump resigns from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the hot seat since the newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly filming the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"What will we do if Brett Kavanaugh's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy has a long winter ahead of it.
But I don't think that's going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika logo.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from "Rangers" with an optimistic attitude before the clash with "Rapid Vienna"
"Rangers" are hosting a clash with "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, while being aware of the fact that after a draw against "Villarreal" in Spain earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify to Group G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorrens, the midfielder due to a knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said the 31-year-old player.
"We got into the game believing we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
Maybe we could have given a little more in the end, but the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
We have another big European night ahead of us on Thursday.
I hope that we will win three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will fight back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that has happened, i.e. my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor regarding the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can now move forward, put last season behind us and achieve success."
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear associated with retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is where you need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not share your desires with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your choices for long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash value, which can help you cover expenses or secure self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Arrange your legal documents: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Take out a health care proxy so that you can empower a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think about your financial resources as well.
This way you would choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Take note of these details in writing to be prepared.

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was returning home from an exit.
The victim aged around 40 was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST (British Summer Time) as an "accidental act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to a communications blackout, aid workers are unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Following are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches for more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them Aceh residents.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow focus earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing havoc and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the quake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the fallen buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officials in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is at the Mat-Su detention facility with the option of getting out if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a B-class offense, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck on the Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle path on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists who got in his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notification of the intention to seek the death penalty delivered in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, there is a possibility of sentencing to death on both of these grounds from the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter for racketeering purposes, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and intent," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "grossly, cruel and depraved."
"Saifulo Habibulaević Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decath, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlius, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," reads the announcement of the state's intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since a capital punishment case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to conduct espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea and sentence you to life without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had earlier urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Mr Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a Tory party conference protest promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been "out of the EU" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in bringing together her deeply divided members was highlighted by the Tory party’s counter-Brexit members who joined a special anti-Brexit protest held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the plan from Checkers despite attacks from pro-Brexit individuals, counter-Brexit individuals and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bonn said at a pro-Brexit gathering "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the plan from Checkers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added, "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the plan from Checkers."
Voicing his stance against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight world wars to be subjugated now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party was also present at the march and told reporters, "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-received by our party and our activists who are actually the ones taking to the streets and to whom our victory in the elections is due.
Please drop the plan from Checkers and start listening to us."
In a targeted message to Ms May, she added, "Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the gathering that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to hand over Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let you get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has allowed us to win Brexit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit figures marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
After the rally, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners reading "Tories against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application created by the party.
"These are the people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren wants to think twice about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democratic Party representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a city hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the November re-election against Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she might replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, whose holding uses a city hall format.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top."
Suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from team "LSU" arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims of the LSU team that happened on Friday had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11am Eastern Time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result he died," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, reports "247sports".
Wade interfered to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing a weapon, as well as shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 192 cm tall junior growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, i.e. an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 catch balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after team orders win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position Bottas had a good start and almost let Hamilton down as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was to have a decisive role.
Mercedes entered boxing a lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a one-on-one action that forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inside at his own free risk to stay on the side after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid and finished seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led for most of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing on the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
Today is a tough day because Waltery did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have their own couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but made a comment that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and obscene and insincere."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been going on in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and reckless and insincere," he said.
“When you see posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, have you published this information?
Do you remember her reply... did you publish the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Finestein with information regarding Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh as early as July, and they were released in early September, but Finestein denied that the information leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Finestein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same at Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way they can.
You can see their meanness, their meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to regain power and control," the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss of Friday's Elite League frame game against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
"Giants" took the lead from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney scored an advantage for the host before Dwyer regained the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for "Dundee" before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season within the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who fought back by defeating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
A chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFaul, which a pass was secured by David Rutherford as Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening game, Sullivan secured the host's lead at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bouchard brought them back again with a powerful game and goal, with the score being 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure the lead of "Dundee" for the first time in a game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory halfway through the final period of the fifth game .
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home to Milton Keynes.
A flight controller has died helping hundreds of people on board to escape the quake.
A flight controller in Indonesia is famed as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are stuck in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu which was swinging continuously.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said that his decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands, and disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be rising because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even be accessed," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six meters ravaged Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "The ambulance carries bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-marts everywhere are being robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse."
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported "CNN".
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: 'Air Niugini' now say one man disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
An airliner operating the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared after saying the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it could not find the male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Knock Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," said Janes.
Janes said he and others were able to cross the half-way water and head to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, as well as that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped with the rescue by transporting people ashore on an inflatable ship before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents on PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none involved the airliner "Air Niugini".
Analyst Finds Timeframe of Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution closed by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When based on the data it was shown that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is due to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What Is Conscientious Hip-Hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative attitude about this genre by including positive messages in their music.
"The High Breed" by Bristol claim that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as a music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and repopulate conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced their revival through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues couple for being fired after sending 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing a married couple for being fired on the grounds of discrimination after she mistakenly received a message from her mother complaining about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she found out in 2016 that she was a black woman after the first day of work of new carer Giselle Morris.
"NOW, another black woman," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman actually did, feeling "uncomfortable" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their sociable nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job badly and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and was then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the married couple for damages of $350 per day over a six-month period, an engagement that would involve her living with the family, which she was originally hired to do, but without entering into a contract.
"I want to show them that these things shouldn't be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know that's discrimination."
The couple retorted to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying that firing Mrs. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying that the lawsuit constituted "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to attack someone who is in this situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Won't Be Able To Connect With Talking Bear, New Letter Reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington's enormous success.
After saying that her father who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before receiving inspiration to write the book from a small teddy bear-shaped toy would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "both bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
To "Paddington", whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
But because he felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to yourself.
I think Paddington's success was perceived in that way.
Although it was a creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to "Paddington himself.""
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
On landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was expected to not survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay put."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Mourners place cards on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can call to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, he quit his job before he passed away because he was "in a really dark place."
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it will have a consequential effect."
Ms. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there to talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphries, who is a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom on Christmas Day when the children opened their presents, and he did not look them in the eye at all and did not establish any contact with them."
She said that his death is a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to get through it: "Such a thing destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we have to move on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain after the FBI launched its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembled what he was looking for, or a limited-time, limited-range investigation, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" amid a entrenched partisan impasse.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican Party supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is solely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are to be held in just a few weeks, or on November 6, and if as expected Republicans face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a Senate vote where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to reverse the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee numbers 'reduced' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees eventually acquire citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and which is easier to cross compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stalling denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work toward achieving the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security either, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that if his temperament was taken into account he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassey Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, sometimes even shouting and lipping as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals who are outraged that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony was evidence that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he proved to be biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not respond to a question about whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, he is not fit to serve on the court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible judgments Kavanaugh will make against the Affordable Care Act or Roe versus Wade, as he is seen as subject to conservative justice.
In the confirmation hearings for his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not respond to questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go into court and expect us to say, 'that's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women should use it too.
It's really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was executive somewhere who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her own technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm furious."
And then she continues to cry.
I think that's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men was when I once started crying with inexpressible anger and an older woman, a cold manager I always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach out to you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987 when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she wouldn't consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Given the fact that the campaign was launched long ago it did not have enough funding, so it promised not to enter the race if it did not raise US$2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she asked.
During a speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overwhelmed with emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you had seen me you would probably have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Ms Schroeder recalls on how the media reacted to the incident.
"You would have thought Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the start of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening and while the battle is far from over, the clash between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly over the course of this week with the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion (150 billion pounds) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to give back to the United States on an equal footing, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to give up anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting its demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a steep economic downturn in either country is far more dangerous than previously determined by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, which is a think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas ravaged by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The Europe team beat the United States team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the "Le Golf National", outside of Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the primacy after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, threw the ball into the water in par-3 at the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 to the European team's lowest-ranked player, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest ranked player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played at the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant of eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
This year has been really hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy we got our title back.
Team play is the most important thing and I am happy to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He now gives the place to his compatriot John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the American legend of golf, by a score of 2:1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It’s an incredible statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, ranking behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to steer the game to low-grass courts, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furrick said after his team's disappointing game "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we gave a hard time to the team from Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Professional Golfers Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to confess to them.
We've been outplayed.
New information on red tide: Concentrations decline in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, conditions of uneven blooming of algae have been observed in the area of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide, a consequence of the blooming of red algae extends for about 130 miles on the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
