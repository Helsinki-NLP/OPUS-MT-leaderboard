>>bos_Latn<< Welsh Assembly Members Concerned About 'Similarity with Muppets'
>>bos_Latn<< Some Members of Parliament (AM) are dismayed by the suggestion that their title be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This is because the name of the assembly is planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all political affiliations are concerned that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
One member of parliament from the Labour Party said his party was concerned that this abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
>>bos_Latn<< For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of parliament from the political party Plaid said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that MWP is pronounced similar to Muppets.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
>>bos_Latn<< The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
>>bos_Latn<< The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission has opted for the option Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the broadest support in public consultations.
Assembly members are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could give the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within weeks.
>>bos_Latn<< Reform laws will also cover other changes to the assembly's mode of operation, including rules for disqualification of assembly members and a board system plan.
>>bos_Latn<< Members of the assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate over the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the country's new name, "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of the neighboring northern state represents a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have fallen silent, and the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I talked to said that there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There’s no one or the other today.”
The disappearance of the bar is understandable.
“People are different these days,” he said.
“Coffee houses no longer play the role of living quarters in the neighborhoods where people regularly go.”
As for churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be back to square one.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will accelerate the closure of these churches because most of those people who move into these housing units are unlikely to become their members."
>>bos_Latn<< Both churches were built by communities composed of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
>>bos_Latn<< The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community performing worship nearby took ownership of the building.
>>bos_Latn<< St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street merchants, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
>>bos_Latn<< A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but since Father Johnson's parishioners decided to rebuild it, they ordered an organ.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the organ “the organ of the poor.”
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: “cultural treasures” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Prof Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan said they were the first organ in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
>>bos_Latn<< Mr Meriveder stated that Saint Martin had not replaced him.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have brought world leaders to the church and others to the episcopal diocese.
>>bos_Latn<< The parish administration - the governing body of the parish, composed of world leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs" to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in hiring architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
>>bos_Latn<< Some parishioners have complained about the intransigence in the work of the eparchy.
Shark injures 13-year-old man during lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boys calling for help, and then rowed to him with the group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said he first thought it was just excitement over the lobster catch, but then “he realized he was yelling ‘She bit me!
“She bit me!”
His whole collarbone was bare,” Hamel said, as he approached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘A shark is in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
>>bos_Latn<< It is not known what species of shark attacked him.
Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a statement that a few weeks earlier the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it was determined not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic upper torso injuries.
>>bos_Latn<< Officials closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Karlsbad to the Swami's area in the town of Enchinitas.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
>>bos_Latn<< Sainsbury's becomes a competitor to the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with department store-style beauty products that are staffed by expert assistants.
>>bos_Latn<< As part of a significant breakthrough into the UK cosmetics market that is spinning 2.8 billion pounds, with the figure rising as sales in fashion and home furnishings markets decline, larger cosmetics divisions will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will open in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in cosmetic products comes from supermarkets finding ways to use the space on the shelves after lawsuits about TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
The Sainsbury's retail chain has announced that it will double the range of cosmetic products to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the Boutique Makeup Palette to make most products suitable for vegans - a demand for which is on the rise when it comes to younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and moving to small daily purchases at local grocery stores means supermarkets need to make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
>>bos_Latn<< Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's retail chain, said that the department's outlet will increasingly resemble self-services as the supermarket chain tries to hit back at retail outlets with large discounts on Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury's retail chain has opened Argos outlet stores in hundreds of Habitats stores since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which it says has boosted food sales and procurement profitability.
The previous attempt of this supermarket to modernize the cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments ended in disrepute.
>>bos_Latn<< The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots Store in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after taking a victory in the division of revenue from pharmaceuticals stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury’s sold the pharmaceutical company to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by presenting an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our cosmetic divisions to provide a better environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that set new standards for the way we shop.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of 11 million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, was “outraged” after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million dollar deal with his personal brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
>>bos_Latn<< Willoby doesn't have time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
>>bos_Latn<< The couple's company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, star of the Dragons series Dan, by pulling out of a last-minute profitable business with their brand to focus on her own new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones was "outraged" when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new offers worth up to 1.5 million pounds did not give him enough time to devote to their brand of home and accessories Truly.
>>bos_Latn<< The company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and was projected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced via Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of her cottages.
According to the source: “Holly has put the Truly brand at the top of her list.
It was going to be her long-term plan to earn money over the next few decades.
>>bos_Latn<< Her decision to withdraw stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
>>bos_Latn<< The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is packed with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the program "This Morning", one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household equipment, as well as possible further delays in the launch date.
It could also spell the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap.
>>bos_Latn<< Willoughby founded Truly with Kapow in 2016, and was joined by Jones, 52, as the company's CEO in March.
These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willobi will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity TV channel ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After the difficult words "sympathies appeared"
He joked about criticism in the media for comments that some say are “not worthy of a president” and for a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump Resigning?
Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“I’m not retiring from anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
>>bos_Latn<< However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that there had been no “appropriate reaction” by the United States to the initial North Korean disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the U.S. is not lifting the sanctions that it is constantly putting pressure on.
Trump made a much more optimistic point of view in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We’ve been a step away from war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests were completed, hostages were released and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
>>bos_Latn<< This unusual approach was defended by speaking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake wreak havoc on Indonesian island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok Island earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
>>bos_Latn<< Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok island population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so we are facing some difficulties,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign staff can work in the field.
>>bos_Latn<< Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pal to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that are shaking Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shores.
The loss of life was probably also contributed by the apparent failure to advertise a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect.
Travelling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
>>bos_Latn<< A hospital ship that was stationed on the island of Lombok to indicate aid to earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new accident.
President Joko Vidodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure and spared no money for roads and railways.
>>bos_Latn<< However, a lack of funding has hit Mr. Yoko's administration, and he is due to be re-elected next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from protracted sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clash in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Daniel Starage, Liverpool player, manages to score an even point against Chelsea
Daniel Staridge on Saturday saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
>>bos_Latn<< Staridge received a pass from Djerdan Shaqiri in the 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
First he moved the ball to the left, and then he kicked it to the far side.
>>bos_Latn<< The ball went high above the goal in the direction of the right upper corner of the net.
>>bos_Latn<< She eventually flew over goalkeeper Kep Arizabalaga who jumped to catch her and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to set myself up and set myself up for a kick, and players like Shaqiri are always playing forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible,” Starage told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I touched the ball once and just kicked it, without much thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Azara in the 25th minute.
The Blue striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovačić with his fifth, then turned in the middle of the field and ran to half of Liverpool.
>>bos_Latn<< Kovačić exchanged a few short shots in the midfield.
He then directed a brilliant center shot, leading Azara to the goal.
>>bos_Latn<< Azar overtook the defense and directed the final left-footed shot into the far net alongside Alison Becker, a Liverpool player.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Tuesday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
>>bos_Latn<< The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to a statement from the disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
There have been numerous reports of people trapped in the rubble of buildings struck by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves as high as 6 meters, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, has buried the remains of collapsed buildings.
>>bos_Latn<< Police arrested the man, 32, on suspicion of murder after the woman was stabbed to death
>>bos_Latn<< The murder investigation was launched after a female body was found this morning in Berkenhead, in Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Muse on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
>>bos_Latn<< Police called people in the area who saw or heard anything to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would invite anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
>>bos_Latn<< I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Berkenhead and was found on the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
>>bos_Latn<< The investigation is ongoing, and police have stated that they are currently informing the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him everyone was barred from entering and leaving the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told they would only be allowed back in a few hours.
Word got out that a police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were in a cordon with another van outside.
>>bos_Latn<< Several police officers stood in the cordon overseeing apartment blocks.
All who have some information are invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and provide a record of 247 as of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate on the monuments due to a dispute over the "falsification of history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-style destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
>>bos_Latn<< However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was an inevitable goal in the ongoing debate on the removal of the statue.
>>bos_Latn<< Cromwell neither issued an order nor conducted iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the part of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Turniccroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure who, to many, still deserves to be glorified.
Mr Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, feel that Cromwell defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case of course, monarchy.
>>bos_Latn<< The credibility of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this mid-17th-century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is as an individual a recognisable figure representing one side of that divide.
>>bos_Latn<< His successes as a holder of the title Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and kept from oblivion."
Killer Pig Injures Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, one farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Juan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< The owner of the pig farm is preparing to inject the pigs with injections in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
>>bos_Latn<< He reportedly came with a relative from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning and noticed that the door of the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty that had blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig caused mortal injuries to the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said a relative referred to by the surname "Vu," according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Juan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so it wouldn't attack anyone else, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Juan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, there have already been recorded cases of attacks by pigs on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting a critical injury on a man.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig had kept a Welsh farmer chained to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be their “trigger”.
“They’re just playing.
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Widespread Showers to the Southwest U.S.
>>bos_Latn<< According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
>>bos_Latn<< However, Rosa will bring down showers in the coming days to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the U.S. that will lead to flooding.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday morning with winds of 137 km/h and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and heads eastward, toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push high tropical moisture northward, toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low-pressure field approaching will lead to widespread showers in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential flooding, spreading of karst with water and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will occasionally cause rainfall of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
>>bos_Latn<< Flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the unrestrained nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely reckless to walk into the desert while at risk of tropical rains.
Due to heavy rainfall, the canyons can turn into frenzied rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to violent winds and dust in the air.
>>bos_Latn<< The low pressure field approaching will bring locally heavy rain in some parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause minor spills of karst with water and slippery slopes.
>>bos_Latn<< It will be the first rain in the region for their rainy season.
Urban tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday evening and Tuesday, rainfall will hit the wider area.
The showers will extend into southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large fluctuations in temperature across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, while in the tropics, the weather will remain rather warm.
>>bos_Latn<< This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature over short distances.
A great example is the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
>>bos_Latn<< Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyne in Iowa there is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees.
>>bos_Latn<< Long-term summer heat will rise again and spread over the next few days.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
The temperature in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels on Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaisey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters ending their regular programming for Friday due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake under which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was touching her and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in glowing testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
>>bos_Latn<< She has computerized the average ratings of television stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people in the office.
By comparison, that number of viewers can match the audience following a playoff game or an Oscar.
The Fox News Channel, with Opinion hosts who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, recorded the highest ratings of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
>>bos_Latn<< ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
>>bos_Latn<< Flake was a central figure of the drama that took place on Friday.
>>bos_Latn<< After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that they would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, cameras by CNN and CBS television on Friday morning recorded protesters shouting at him as he tried to drive an elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
>>bos_Latn<< He stood for several minutes staring down as he was being insulted, which CNN broadcast live.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and so many women are helpless.’”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee was due to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate.
However, Flake said he only agreed to do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which was insisted on by a minority of Democrats.
Fleika was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
>>bos_Latn<< After talking to Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
>>bos_Latn<< Flake's election had weight because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing politics' in Brexit case
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview alongside the one on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson, the previous foreign minister, attacked her so-called Brexit plan, calling the proposal for a single UK and EU customs zone "completely meaningless".
Wade Sims murder: Police arrest suspect Dajon Simpson for University of Louisiana player's death
>>bos_Latn<< Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of gunman Wade Sims, a 20-year-old University of Louisiana basketball player.
Mr. Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
>>bos_Latn<< Officials released video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police found the glasses on the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the WAFB channel attached to the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police stated that he admitted to fatally wounding Wade with a pistol shot.
>>bos_Latn<< He was given a $350,000 bail, the lawyer said.
The office of the parish pathologist of East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday citing a gunshot wound through the head to the neck.
>>bos_Latn<< Credit for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest was attributed to the Louisiana State Police's Task Force on the Capture of Fugitives, the State Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents.
University of Louisiana athletics director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for “preaching and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shaken" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
>>bos_Latn<< Ash ejecting the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
>>bos_Latn<< The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
>>bos_Latn<< This center has recorded more mild seismological activities.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City's municipalities, such as Hocimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with riot police as thousands joined counter-demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's population-sharing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, restrained by riot police, threw eggs and powdered paint at them, and dark clouds of dust formed in the streets that are usually teeming with tourists.
>>bos_Latn<< Later in the day there was also a brawl that police officers restrained with batons.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" as they faced Unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received aid for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions have not eased in the region defined for independence even a year after the October 1 referendum that separatist Catalans celebrate, even though Madrid declared it illegal.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, though the response was small as crowds of people boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
>>bos_Latn<< Groups advocating for independence camped out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police force.
>>bos_Latn<< Demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we had one of the brightest moments.
My parents cried with joy that they were able to vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation," he said.
Despite achieving a crucial but narrow victory in regional elections in December last year, pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to continue in the same vein this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest on the phone in support of police, said the conflict was being fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, has announced he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Highlighting the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the collapse of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after slamming car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in London.
This incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 Ballynagar Crescent Street British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the house.
>>bos_Latn<< Menge's scoring brings Livingstone a 1-0 win over Rangers
>>bos_Latn<< Dolly Menga secured the win with the first goal for Livingston
Livingston surprised Rangers by forcing Steven Gerard to concede only a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Doli Manga brought changes with his goal as Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a win in the Premier League this season, and next week he meets with leaders on the table Harts, behind eight points.
>>bos_Latn<< Before that, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeaten streak in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against uninspired guests
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, as the offensive game caused Rangers problems at all levels.
Scott Robinson broke through, but carried the ball in front of the goal, to be kicked by Alan Litgou past the net after slipping to receive a kick with Craig Halket's head in front of the goal.
>>bos_Latn<< The hosts gladly let Rangers players play in front of them, knowing they could give the visiting team difficulties with the actions played.
That’s how they scored the key goal.
>>bos_Latn<< Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston opened the game after taking a free kick by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to employ Menga who passed the ball into goal from mid-sixteenth.
>>bos_Latn<< In the previous part of the game, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but could not break through the host's defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
>>bos_Latn<< In the same style, it continued into the second half, though Kelly had to fend off one stroke from Alfred Morelos.
Alan McGregor, the Rangers goaltender, deflected an attack by Scott Pitman and Litgou kicked past the goal in Livingston's second-innings action.
Livingston defended several centre-forwards, and two wanted penalties were rejected - after Halket's objection to replacing Glen Middleton and one for playing with his hand.
"The Phenomenal Game" by Livingstone - analysis
Alasder Lamont from BBC Scotland at Toni Makaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
All players, without exception, were outstanding and again exceeded expectations on this upward trajectory.
Since their return to the front row they have hardly changed the style of the game and the people, but great credit should be given to Holt for the way he has brought vitality to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unsurpassed in leading a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on standby the whole time.
>>bos_Latn<< However, Rangers was not inspired.
As good as he used to be under Gerard, he fell way below that level.
They couldn't make a point -- they only broke through the host's defense once -- and it's kind of the Rangers' alarm bell, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met with a mixed reception in Kolonje
The meeting between Turkish and German leaders on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Kolonj to open a huge new mosque.
Most of the Turkish population lives outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - have also been heard to denounce Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The clashing protests reflect a split opinion of a visitor who some Turks in Germany are calling a hero and others accuse of being an autocrat.
Road accident in Depford: Iclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 UK summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics gave him help, but the man was killed on the spot.
A few months before the crash, another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash, which the driver struck and fled.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
>>bos_Latn<< Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
Six police officers were injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison said.
The ongoing riots occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists was brought in to overcome the unrest, which was reduced to one wing and in which eight prisoners participated.
Officers were given assistance on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison officers have been brought in for the ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
>>bos_Latn<< Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear to us that those responsible will be reported to the police, which is why they could stay behind bars for longer."
>>bos_Latn<< Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the state.
>>bos_Latn<< In June, it was announced that the prison warden was undergoing hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were called to jail for serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential flooding (which can well reach areas affected by drought)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest, carrying with it the risks of torrential flooding.
>>bos_Latn<< The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and its approach will be announced by rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
>>bos_Latn<< Hurricane Katrina (1967) struck a region 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border."
>>bos_Latn<< The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm, with amounts up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as Mogolon Rim in Arizona.
>>bos_Latn<< In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin (the Great Basin), it is likely to be 2.5 -5 cm, with possible totals in isolated places of up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential flooding, the rain Rosa will bring can be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious cause for concern, rain will be welcome in some parts because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected at least by extreme second-order drought," reports weather.com.
>>bos_Latn<< The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, which still had a hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico and heading north at 20 kilometers per hour.
>>bos_Latn<< The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it has lost power.
>>bos_Latn<< Therefore, landslides in Mexico are expected to occur when the storm reaches tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible, which carries a significant risk of flooding.
“Total rainfall of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern state of Sonora, with as much as 10 cm possible,” weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late into the night on Tuesday.
"The main hazard expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rain in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. desert in the southwest," the National Hurricane Monitoring Center said in a statement.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening torrential floods and the spreading of karst water in deserts and landslides on hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
>>bos_Latn<< After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday at around 04:00 British summer time.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, the Avon and Somerset Police Service said.
Police have asked anyone who may have footage of the incident on their mobile phones to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered the indignation and fury” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the merciless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the indignation and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh, in an energetic and emotional testimony before Congress on Thursday, denied allegations by Christine Blaise Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At this hearing, Ford also testified about her claims.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw all the genius, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
>>bos_Latn<< A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class biography in public service," he told rallying supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the significance of the Republican response in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump concluded that the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a statement from senior GOP aide to CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami leave hundreds dead, and numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by giant waves that washed up on beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the town of Palu for a beach festival on Friday as waves six metres high hit the coast, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was accompanied by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of immediately escaping and therefore becoming victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
>>bos_Latn<< Some people climbed trees to avoid a tsunami and so survived, he said.
>>bos_Latn<< About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
The aerial photos released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been skewed and torn down, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes struck the coastal city again on Saturday.
An area of 2.4 million people was hit by a series of earthquakes.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy of Friday's devastating earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographic characteristics of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a greater tsunami strength," he said.
Nugroho said the damage was "huge" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
>>bos_Latn<< Nugroho stated that greater losses and damage were possible along the coast 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely cut off and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were headed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," the statement said.
The agency received criticism from various parties on Saturday for failing to issue a notification that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves came at a time when a warning had been issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building is heard shouting from his veins, warning people on the approaching tsunami street.
>>bos_Latn<< Within minutes a wall of water had hit the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
>>bos_Latn<< Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people were still in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
>>bos_Latn<< The city's airport is only reopened for assistance arriving and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodoo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
World Vision humanitarian staff arrived safely from Dongala to the town of Palu where employees are hiding in shelters made of waterproof material set up in the office courtyard and on their way to the town were greeted by scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
>>bos_Latn<< Even when aid groups began taking the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas resources, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't come to that yet.
"It continues to be characterized as a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Palo following the earthquake and tsunami that struck him on Friday, friends and family of the missing still harbored the hope that their loved ones would miraculously escape the sad fates of the victims of natural disasters.
The boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< Rescuers released a woman under the rubble on Sunday who was trapped next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
>>bos_Latn<< The others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said that hours after news of Roa Roa's collapse reached the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, his messages carried only one grey mark, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to throw in more money, Detective Denis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "ran behind an employee at Brink's" and stole a bag of money he was supposed to put in an ATM.
>>bos_Latn<< According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
All those with information about their identities are invited to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to 'Ye'
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: “It will once be known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which came out in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live", in which he is expected to announce a new album "Yandhi".
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and it means ‘you’,” he said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m all of us, that’s us.
From the name Kanje, which means ‘the only one’, I have gone to just ‘Ye’ (you), which is the personification of all that is good, bad, and obscure in us.
>>bos_Latn<< This album is, essentially, a reflection of who we are."
He is just one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, who is known by the nicknames Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, pointed out this year that he would like to be referred to as "Love" (Love) and "Brother Love" (Brother Love).
>>bos_Latn<< A former West's associate, JJ-Z, used the nickname with or without dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to never use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students in this country.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador made a promise in the square in Tlatelolco that he would “never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were based in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving financial aid every month to those studying and opening more free state universities.
He said unemployment and the inability to get an education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in AI development, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in this area, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. foreign governments announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“For starters, it would be good to double the budget for artificial intelligence research, as all other countries are doing so much for the United States, and we are striving for new progress in this domain,” he said.
Double funding could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book “Super-Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, works as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
>>bos_Latn<< In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and was later the CEO of Microsoft Research Company and President of Google's China branch.
Li paid tribute to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Department’s “Robot Challenge” of New Technology Development Agency (DARPA) and asked when the next one would take place, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Li said.
"It's not the academic leaders going to China, it's the big corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years employed prominent minds from universities to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
Li said changes to immigration policies could help the U.S. strengthen its artificial intelligence aspirations.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to AI doctors,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
>>bos_Latn<< The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similarly to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will include partners from the sector and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “New Generation Artificial Intelligence”.
On the other hand, the National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that required the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked their bids for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of a neighboring northern state represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would jeopardise the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, majority Slovenian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
>>bos_Latn<< While this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
>>bos_Latn<< The state election commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went out to vote for my children because we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev voted in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zorica and son Duška, to change the name of the country, which should pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by opponents of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upright heads, not through the servants' entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result “would be a confirmation of our future.”
A poll released last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will vote in the referendum, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, concluded that 57 per cent of voters would vote in the referendum.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to succeed, it would take half of the registered voters plus one to vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since taking power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire Brighton defense and scores the goal
>>bos_Latn<< Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defence on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England by taking the win for Manchester City by 2-0.
This seemed too easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield from where he started the attack.
>>bos_Latn<< He ran between three Brighton defensive players, so mow everything in a row in the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
>>bos_Latn<< He outscored one defence player, then outscored several others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
He then kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English winger immediately returned the ball to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by shooting into the right side of the net with his right shoe.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point."
>>bos_Latn<< However, the initial advantage to the Skyblues in the Premier League meeting was brought by Sterling.
>>bos_Latn<< He scored a goal in the 29th minute.
>>bos_Latn<< Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton territory in that action.
He directed a wonderful pass to Leroy Seine on his left flank.
>>bos_Latn<< Seine had several contacts with the ball before employing Sterling on another tripod.
>>bos_Latn<< The Sky Blues striker inserted the ball into the net, then immediately slipped out of the field boundaries.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Scherzer wants to play a Rocky game with no competitive significance for the Nationals
>>bos_Latn<< Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs competition, there was not much reason to insist on another game.
>>bos_Latn<< However, competitively minded Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in play-off playoffs.
The Rockets secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to win their first division title.
“Although we can’t get anything, at least we can get out there knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably be at the highest level against any point I would play this year.
Why wouldn't I participate in such a competition?"
>>bos_Latn<< Nationals has yet to announce a starter for the week, but are reportedly considering letting Cherzer pitch in such a situation.
Chercer, who would have made it to the opening game for the 34th time, held practice on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he normally rests.

Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh, during a speech on the significance of the Republican response in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved will be at stake in November.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the biggest - even though I am not running personally, I am actually running and that is why I am fighting for excellent candidates on all sides," he said.
Trump continued, “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
>>bos_Latn<< They are determined to regain power by not choosing the means, you see the mischief, the dirty games.
>>bos_Latn<< They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and disrupt.”
“You could have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, spiteful, disgusting, and dishonest.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for him - it was very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
>>bos_Latn<< The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
I am just the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome - just because we have expressed our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan River, went through a similar thing because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
>>bos_Latn<< In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe - the irony is that these are similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Labour Party meeting in East Nottingham on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive".
Of the eight years that I have been a member of parliament from the Labour Party, Friday night general committee meetings have been just that.
Unfortunately, meetings are rarely held in this spirit today, and the promise of a "nobler, more moderate" policy has long been forgotten, if ever there were such aspirations.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
That began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought shared similar political views began to expect me to change them from the roots and take positions I would otherwise never agree with - whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Every public address I make, regardless of what I say, follows the tirade of abuse on social media, calling for the annulment of my election, condemning the center’s policies, and saying that I don’t belong in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one with that experience.
I am aware that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
>>bos_Latn<< I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis without ever being distracted by it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The real truth is that we no longer accept different views and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of election, the party becomes more and more alienated.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised to keep my head down, to keep my opinions to myself, and then I would “be fit.”
>>bos_Latn<< But it runs counter to my political goals.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school bench, caused by the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government that allowed my school classroom to literally collapse, I have sought to fight for better public services to those in need - whether as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my political affiliation, not even in the last election.
>>bos_Latn<< No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and the topics on which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just like to say that, at a time when our country is rushing towards a Brexit that will endanger households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to the Momentum of Nottingham organization, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of invalidation of my election or political ruse will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ajr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ajr climbs to the top
>>bos_Latn<< The two overdue essays may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr took the deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
>>bos_Latn<< They are now at the top of the table, as the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the home team prevailed thanks to superior defense, as well as more chances used and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in previous games and we haven’t lost yet, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Kristi of the Melrose team said: "All praise to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we have."
>>bos_Latn<< Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, converted by Frazier Klimo, brought Ira an advantage, but the yellow card for Scotland's captain, Rory Hugh, taken out of the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Bagot grasped the unconverted essay.
>>bos_Latn<< Clima scored with a penalty to increase Irra's lead, before, at half-time, scoring and turning a solo essay for Irra to reach the score 17-5 at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a longer hold-up due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was taken out on a stretcher, and Ayr further increased the lead with an essay by Stafford McDowell, converted by Klimo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then Ira's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player more by Bruce Colvin failing to turn the essay, after a short fierce pressure.
>>bos_Latn<< However, the host side returned and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for wrestling with Klim without the ball, off the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind the pier of Ira in the attack.
>>bos_Latn<< Klimo converted the essay, which he did again almost immediately in the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent Gregor Henry's winger for a fifth home-page essay.
'Still Game' Star Is Getting Ready for a New Career in the Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed CEO of a company that holds licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he is a screenwriter and stars alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
>>bos_Latn<< The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of the show's broadcast and Kiernan appears to be making plans for life after Kreglang.
>>bos_Latn<< According to official records he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested Kiernan wanted to join the "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia stripped of access to the sea hopes the court will allow it to return to the Pacific
>>bos_Latn<< Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean-coloured flag flying in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are plastered with the slogan: “We have a full right to the sea.
>>bos_Latn<< We owe it to him to bring it back."
In Bolivia, which has been denied access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of coastline in a bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it a longing for another voyage across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia’s current state of affairs is at hand, governed by a spirit of unity and tranquility and, of course, awaits the outcome in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of talks, Chile is under an obligation to negotiate the granting of a sovereign seaport to Bolivia.
For Eva Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native-born president who is expected to face a controversial re-election fight next year, Monday’s ruling also carries many risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he vowed in late August.
However, some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor -- and that little would change if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has said it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final arguments have been heard indicates that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And not only has the Bolivian case not progressed, but the previous four years may have set it back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been embraced by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric killed any affection for Chile, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edvardo Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed with the court’s unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - had used the issue of the sea as a political base.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
"This verdict is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it doesn't trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never abandon their nuclear weapons programs if they don't trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit in talks by conflicting leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart deadlocked diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was only a dream that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government has been sceptical about Pyongyang’s seriousness about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which its country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows feature the latest lines of bulky head covering accessories you’ll soon see in the nearby main street
If you want to enrich the hat collection with bulkier models or completely block out the sun, the search is over.
Designers Valentino and Tom Braun presented a series of freaky huge head accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that overshadowed everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats set Instagram on fire this summer, and these designers showcased their impressive creations on the catwalk.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that swallowed the heads of the model with its size.
Among other bulky additions were melons decorated with jewelry, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they weren't designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks at the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sutured lips and looked more like Hannibal Lector than high fashion.
>>bos_Latn<< One creation resembled a diving gear complete with a snorkel and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you’re building on the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details, you’re in luck.
>>bos_Latn<< Those following the trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn on nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat "La Bomba" with a circumference of two meters wide that has walked many celebrities - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label on this impractical hat, which flooded social networks, was behind another big creation that was shown on the runway - straw beach bags almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
In Jacques’ collection “La Riviera” for spring/summer 2019 at the Fashion Week in Paris, the bag made of raffia in burnt orange, bordered by rafia and with a white leather handle on top was the most prominent.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will arrive on the main street next summer - since the designer has made such a boom, it would be hard to ignore such a demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding test scores, further strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
>>bos_Latn<< With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will get into their head.
If you speak in his native language, it will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
>>bos_Latn<< Based on the recent results of this year's tests we see that languages at the top are league tables with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
>>bos_Latn<< Data collected from 74 member schools of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade A from Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited as underlying problems in filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for future careers.
Given more potential business opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned another language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they have a skill like this for life.
>>bos_Latn<< The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks multiple languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language to speak a double-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In every school in Scotland, different languages will be taught.
>>bos_Latn<< Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will be learning languages that are thought to be most important for the United Kingdom in advance of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be more languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are expert in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
It cannot be denied that in today’s global business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so they must have their place in education.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered "the skills of international communication".
>>bos_Latn<< Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and exceptional achievements.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
It's the end of the line for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
>>bos_Latn<< Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the week-long preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his exact minutes have yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely have limited minutes.
>>bos_Latn<< After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies tonight as part of an election campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
>>bos_Latn<< This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for next week, with stays in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his nominee for the Supreme Court seat postponed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it goes to the polls in November.
What time is Trump going to hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch him online?
A Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia below online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected vote to confirm Senate admissions delayed by a week until the FBI completes its investigation.
However, this series of rallies is being held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the run-up to the November elections.
The five rallies, which will be held next week, aim to “activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"The importance of Congress's control is so great for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the busy election campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016, will be his second in a month on Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try and raise it in the polls," Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination to stay in the game to meet singles matches on Sunday
>>bos_Latn<< After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's doubles tournament may just be what Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentary variability is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So whose side would you say the momentum is on now?
“They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so we can say that the momentum is on our side,” said Jordan Spitt.
Europe is, of course, ahead of us with four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Although Americans, according to Spit, get a little bit of wind in their backs and have a lot on their side, especially Spit and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each have three points out of four.
Spit was lethal from the first to the last blow and gave everyone a homework assignment.
>>bos_Latn<< The cheers of enthusiasm grew louder throughout his round, to eventually play a key final kick and score a fourth match with the same score when he and Thomas trailed by two after two.
>>bos_Latn<< His final kick which won the match with 15 holes was met with a similar scream, reflecting the belief that the U.S. team was not falling out.
“Basically, you just have to do your best and take care of your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all these players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
>>bos_Latn<< The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual and at the same time charming European couple won all four matches and played without fail.
"Molywood" was the only couple who did not play a game on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the second half on Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience have solidified them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there is no more popular player than Flitvud or Molinari who could take a potential European victory in the sunset over the grounds of the club "Le Golf National".
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European celebration.
>>bos_Latn<< Bug Watson and Web Simpson quickly overcame Serge Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The bogeys and double bogeys in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never managed to spring.
Although, on Sundays, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
A four-ball game and a doubles tournament are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great lead ahead of the final day, but this session of the doubles tournament has also shown that the U.S. team has a desire for a fight that some doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads by 10-6 ahead of the final day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, having gained a 10-6 advantage over the United States after Saturday's matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were the first to lead by two victories over a disgruntled Tiger Woods, increasing the previous score on the grounds of the Le Golf National club to four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn, who struggled to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in the morning game with four balls and won the series 3-1.
>>bos_Latn<< The U.S. put up more resistance in the doubles tournament, winning two matches, but were unable to reduce the backlog.
Jim Furik's side must win eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
>>bos_Latn<< After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reid in a four-ball game, they then combined splendidly and overcame pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson DeChambo with an even more convincing 5-4.
>>bos_Latn<< Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, has shined at times, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament and seven in a row.
>>bos_Latn<< Justin Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henry Stenson in the pair's tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka - first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not go as planned on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
>>bos_Latn<< Three-time Majors tournament winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< They struggled to win by 2-1 over John Ram and Jan Pulter in a four-ball game, to later come back and beat Pulter and Rory McElroy by 4-3 in the pair's tournament, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team come back after a four-point gap before a single match, although Furik's side, who defend the title, had enough draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, Sunday's counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says 'no talk' of unilateral disarmament if no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual U.N. General Assembly, Ri said North Korea had taken “significant measures over the past year to show goodwill,” such as suspending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“There is no proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no question that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for incremental steps, his statement was significant because he did not throw unilateral denuclearization out of the game as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also defied calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States is not giving up on ‘denuclearization first’ and is increasing the level of pressure with sanctions in order to forcibly achieve its goal, opposing even the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“That they think sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that extending sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for the second Kim-Trump summit the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If we were negotiating this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he said at the UN General Assembly that shooting at the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still more work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea carries out denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had not set a timeline for this, saying, "If it's supposed to take two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strictly and unrelentingly enforced until there is complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made and North Korea would condemn him after just a few hours for making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile test site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him the "appropriate measures" required by the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Get Enough Sleep
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students into more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning "all night long with the help of caffeine".
One academic noted that university students are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Chisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
>>bos_Latn<< The idea of this course came after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“One girl finally came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year of college?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is held for the first time this year, students are introduced to the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports performance, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was noticed that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dorm room and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants listen to how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
>>bos_Latn<< Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know this - just as everyone has the right to know what the health consequences of smoking are," added Professor Chisler.
A culture of pride in “sleepless sleep” persists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep the brain goes into a starvation regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Chisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
>>bos_Latn<< He says this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance throughout the campus.
The next step, it is hoped, would be for all postgraduate students to undergo a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chisler recommended that students consider setting alarms in time for sleep and wakefulness and take care of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerard's team with goal
Rangers suffered another setback when Dolly Menga kicked Stephen Gerard's loose team into a 1-0 defeat of Livingston.
>>bos_Latn<< The Ibrox Stadium team sought to take their first away victory since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard as manager only a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind unbeaten Ladbrokes Premier League leaders, Harts.
Menga kicked seven minutes before half time, and the Rangers' uninspired lineup never came close to a tie.
As Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone climbs to third behind Hibernian just for the goal difference.
Rangers may face additional problems after line judge Kalum Spence had to be given help due to a head wound after being thrown at him from the side with an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that went over Ayr and placed in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took a point with the Harts last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-trained team was pressing opponents at every turn.
>>bos_Latn<< Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
>>bos_Latn<< It was a bit short to score just two minutes after Meng's first pass into the empty space sent Scott Pitman onto Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a big chance and kicked past the goal.
Kegan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Litgou kicked past the goal at the second stave.
>>bos_Latn<< Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last line gave out more hope than faith in themselves.
>>bos_Latn<< Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received the penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Loules collided, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
>>bos_Latn<< Rangers scored just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox Stadium goaltender, Liam Kelley, defended the kick with Lasana Koulibali's head without any major problems and tamed the shot made by Ovie Ejarri.
>>bos_Latn<< Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true power ratio during the game, no one can dispute that he was credited if for nothing else, then for the effort put in.
>>bos_Latn<< Rangers again could not cope with the deep-seated action of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Sloto Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the winger hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came running from his line to block him.
>>bos_Latn<< However, Livingston went on to get the guests to play just as they pleased, with long balls from Litgou and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held on well and defended the Jacobs attack, and then sent the ball from the corner of the head to Lithgo next to the goal.
>>bos_Latn<< Glen Middleton, Rangers' replacement, was looking for another penalty at the end of the game when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not respond again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the mainstays of science, Geiger counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Bells, starring seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really being heard!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to Identify Damaged Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to Identify and Kill Depraved Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and then re-inject them.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, had ovarian cancer withdrawn for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab so they can “see” a protein that occurs in many types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has proven itself well in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanje Vest joined the fierce attacks in defense of Trump, wearing a cap with the label MAGA, after a guest appearance on the SNL show.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for some political office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, "Ghost Town," wearing a "Make America Great" cap, he delivered a heated speech against the Democrats and again supported Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who would say, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The show aired a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blaisey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
>>bos_Latn<< Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted footage of West's heated speech to social networks.
It is unclear whether the deadline was intended to make fun of Vesta.
>>bos_Latn<< Additionally, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he was having trouble because of the cape he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out with that hat on.”
They threatened me!
And then they say I sank," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The news continued, “Do you want to see what it looks like?” adding that “they’re going to put on the Superman cape because it means you can’t give me orders.
>>bos_Latn<< Then spread the love."
The audience booed his remarks at least twice, and it seemed as if the members of the SNL cast were uncomfortable, Variety reported, while one of the attendees told the magazine: “There was pain throughout the studio.”
At the last minute, the news replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, passed away a few days ago.
The news confused many with his performance of the song "I Love It", masked in a bottle of Perrier water.
The news received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOT STAYING IN FRONT OF THE VIOLENTS.”
However, Karen Hunter, host of the TV show, said in a tweet that the West is simply “its own and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and extols an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
The rapper previously tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was now "a creature once known as Kanye West".
He’s not the first artist to change his name before Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Didi.
>>bos_Latn<< Another rapper, Snoop Dog, was formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
>>bos_Latn<< The incident occurred on Ballyhackamore Street, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
>>bos_Latn<< The public prosecutor's office will consider the aforementioned charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington denounces macho culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy full of violence.
>>bos_Latn<< However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the macho hero stereotype, saying that because of such on-screen roles, young men often feel like they have to be rough to gain respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit expressed his view that "something went wrong" and addressed the issue of how to deal with the devastating macho culture of the #JaSto era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m quite troubled by the question right now: What did we do wrong to represent masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of the pernicious macho culture due to the portrayal of characters posing as male.
He added: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain mold of a man’s behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the main questions of our time, how do we change that?
“Something must have gone wrong with the boy.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones after it ended the following summer, saying he was "done with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's theatrical play True West - the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks getting to know his current wife, Rose, is the best thing the Game of Thrones series has brought him.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
>>bos_Latn<< Rose starred as Igrith, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this fictional series that is the winner of the Emmy Awards.
>>bos_Latn<< The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase
>>bos_Latn<< China has announced a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS of 14%.
>>bos_Latn<< According to health workers, more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
>>bos_Latn<< In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus is transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China in the past as a result of viral blood transfusions.
However, the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
>>bos_Latn<< However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV through sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
>>bos_Latn<< Studies estimate that, due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Transmission of the virus often occurs because of inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff has released data on GOP senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
>>bos_Latn<< U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff published personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and websites of the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
>>bos_Latn<< The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Li and Orin Hatch, of Utah.
The information came online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
>>bos_Latn<< Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate allegations - is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
>>bos_Latn<< This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie."
>>bos_Latn<< The statement by Waters quickly sparked condemnation on the Internet, which was also voiced by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This dement exudes fury," wrote the Flyer.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He can't be impertinent.
He can't question the prosecutor's motives.
He has to be calm and calm.”
The flyer compared Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters's midterm election, also took to Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” he tweeted.
Ms Waters said her office had informed “relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they are accountable to the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of the film "Johnny English - Back in Action" - lukewarm satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can be applied to this sequel to the Johnny English satirical action comedy franchise - which began in 2003 with the creation of "Johnny English" and came back to life in 2011 with the sequel "Johnny English: Born Again".
>>bos_Latn<< Is an ironic autosatry about what kind of obvious garbage we are going to be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the obnoxious, incompetent Johnny English, with his face like a tire, has been given a new opportunity to mess something up - his name more than anything else reveals to be a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinema audience is not English.
It is, of course, a cunning secret agent who, despite bizarre pretensions to the highest glamour, carries within him a little Clouseau, a speck of Mr. Bean and a crumb of that boy who played only one note within the theme melody of the realization of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It was also originally based on the passenger and mystery man in the international setting that Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving the chaos behind.
In this latest installment on Johnny English, there are also several scenes of noteworthy importance.
I liked the one where Johnny English approaches the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades rattle briefly about his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially given that “serious” movie brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, now regularly include comic elements.
Humour seems to be designed for children, not adults, and, to me, Johnny English's freakish mishaps are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent movie gags when he played Bean.
It is now a very topical issue that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain’s super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of an agent on duty - unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and struggling character, who is already experiencing a complete meltdown due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character modeled on Theresa May, but the script is quite poor.
Intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
This is Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a fancy institution, but unofficially gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of the film "School of Rock".
>>bos_Latn<< English rushes back to Whitehall for instructions and reunites with the former patient, sidekick Bau, who is re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
>>bos_Latn<< Bow is now a married man, married to the submarine commander, in an interpretation by Vicky Pepperdine that is somewhat redundant.
And so the twisted and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in the secret service of Her Majesty and fortune the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bau begin their odyssey of comical adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a dazzling French restaurant, real chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht, and English starts a real anarchy by trying to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house using virtual reality headsets.
Obviously, a lot of effort has been put into this last sequence, but no matter how cute and cheerful, the entire film seems to be made for children.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
The Labour Party has denied a plan for Britons to work four days a week and get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan under which Britons will work four days a week - and be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on to workers the time they save thanks to the AI revolution by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend - but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" into the party's economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
>>bos_Latn<< The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “The rules are expected to be reviewed by the end of the year.
“Change will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits in with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s industrial strategy in general.”
>>bos_Latn<< The Labour Party was not the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party advocated for a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, such a tendency is currently not shared by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's agenda and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to lay out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell emphasized his determination to regain power from “wicked directors” and “profits” in public enterprises.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that current shareholders in the water companies may not get their overall stake because the Labour government could resort to "reducing" on suspicion of unfair treatment.
He also confirmed plans to bring workers to company boards and create Inclusive Equity Funds, through which 10 percent of private firms' equity would be handed over to employees who would receive an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about whether they could change their mind about the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
>>bos_Latn<< The FBI investigation based on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed for at least a week the final vote on his appointment as a member of the Supreme Court and raised the question of whether the bureau's investigation results could affect the withdrawal of support from some of the Republican senators.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, sure,” Kennedy said.
"I said, going to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the charge came up and I said, 'Did you do that?'
>>bos_Latn<< He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice appears to be carved in stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it wouldn't have been changed by the most explosive accusation," he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Bret threw it all away decisively,” Graham added, referring to Kristin Blazi Ford.
“And no one she mentioned can confirm that.
It's from 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new is going to happen.”
What is the “Global Citizen” Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a long and impressive roster of performers and no less impressive mission to eradicate poverty around the world.
The seventh festival, The Global Citizen, will be visited by tens of thousands of people on the large Central Park lawn, not only to enjoy performances by performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true goal of this event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Eradication Project, an international group advocating the eradication of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do a series of tasks, i.e. “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to one of the world’s leaders, making a phone call or any other meaningful way of drawing attention to their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been, given the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” where people feel they have done something significant by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen organizers say they have recorded more than 19 million shares of their supporters aimed at achieving a number of different goals since 2011.
They argue that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce goals and programs worth over $37 billion that would affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 goals and announcements arising from its actions, for which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly impacted over 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key programs include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and performers contracted in the UK to “help children grow to their full potential”, who have pledged that Rwanda will provide $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice in the form of malnutrition into an item in historical textbooks,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for the Power to Eat movement, said in an address to an audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for the Power to Feed project, which will see interventions aimed at improving nutrition reach 5 million women and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on our website is “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult road - there will be failures and setbacks.
But as great human rights have been won before us, and as anti-apartheid movements have succeeded, so will we, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B and Janelle Monnet are some of the performers performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to block Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
Washington can rely on its navy “as needed” to prevent Russian energy from reaching destination markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki said on Monday.
Zinki said Russia's engagement in Syria - where it specifically intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a cover for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to sell their energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to this official, there are ways and means by which this can be prevented.
"The United States has the ability, with the help of our navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinki addressed attendees at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that calls itself the "power consumers voice" in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, arguing that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of energy," he said, saying for Russia that "a pony that knows only one trick" is also a country with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a far cheaper option for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion pipeline that should double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is simply spurred on by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy should be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the choice of a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very bothered by the interference of third countries in our energy supply," Dieter Kemf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will 'think twice' about running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think twice" about running for president after the midterm election.
>>bos_Latn<< At a meeting with the city administration in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and take out our dysfunctional government, and that includes the woman at the top," she said, according to the Hill newspaper.
"After November 6th, I'll think twice about running for president."
During a meeting with the city administration, Warren criticized President Donald Trump, saying she was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But a poll released on Thursday showed that even in her own constituency, a majority of voters do not think Warren should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University Policy Research Center of Suffolk and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a bid.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrik, with 38% backing for the presidential bid and 48% voting against.
Other Democratic names mentioned in connection with the 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make the official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sara Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Tape Palin at Donald Trump rally
>>bos_Latn<< Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after coming back, I can understand other families feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at a rally of support for Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an example of a major problem that everyone ignored and said of her son and other war veterans: "they come back a little different, they come back tarnished, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the military have given this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence in which a woman was assaulted, interfering with reporting domestic violence, and handling a weapon in an alcoholic state, said Den Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasili police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support review of new asylum rules
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal review of a new U.S. law that provides for a refusal to provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of 18 states and the Colombian district submitted a petition in Washington on Friday through a “friend of the court” as an expression of support for an asylum seeker seeking to challenge the regulation, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed against the federal regulation by the American Civil Liberties Union has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons, gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on June 20.
She's being held in Texas.
>>bos_Latn<< Attorneys-at-law who provide legal support for Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries from which large numbers of asylum seekers come to the United States, as nations facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Claims Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Reissin said Friday that the new law "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all decisions on all asylum applications to be made on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances stated in the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court’s friend said in a statement.
Lawyers said in the document that the regulation denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political stance,” Sessions said when announcing the regulations on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to solve all the problems - or even all the serious problems - that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts continue in Palu, and the death toll doubles as the race to find survivors continues.
The survivors were faced with an increasingly dire situation.
"It's very tense," 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said, calming her son who is crying feverishly in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency cars are bringing in bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, sifting through the sunken things and trying to save everything they could find.
>>bos_Latn<< Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwye Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulders, were lying outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to strong earthquakes that continued.
The tear-filled eyes recount how he felt as the earthquake violently shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I think I was pushed into the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding celebration.
“I heard my wife crying, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'abusing propaganda ads'
>>bos_Latn<< A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily, highlighting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday a paid supplement to the Tea Daily in the Dimoyne Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusations against China for trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China rejected.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election have marked what U.S. officials described as a new phase in Washington's campaign to put increasing pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war as they introduce new rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliation in the early stages of the trade war was aimed at hitting exporters from countries like Iowa, which back Trump's Republican Party, experts from the United States and China said.
Teri Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
As Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of the Dimoyne Register, China is “now further scolding us by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, publishing paid advertisements in the Dimoyn Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at a newsstand in Beijing, you will find few opposing voices, and you will not see any real reflection of the opposing opinions that the Chinese may have about the worrying trajectory of the Chinese economy, as the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused an offer to publish" his article, but did not specify which one it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections, over a debacle with Justice Kavanaugh
While many at the top of the Republican Party also support defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn it will produce a negative reaction, especially for women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this situation are extremely strong, and most Republicans are already known to want to give it their vote.
Such things are impossible to take back," said Grant Riher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, in an article published in the Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Richer expressed doubt that the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease disgruntled voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
Protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate corridor after Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Kristin Blazi Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach unprecedented proportions," Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political activist, told the news site.
"People say it's already on a high level, that's true.
But it can continue to grow, especially among indecisive suburban female voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before the public testimony in which Ford detailed allegations of sexual harassment by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there might be a negative reaction if Republicans confirmed his candidacy.
"This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News last week.
“It’s not just about the board’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will end up in court, it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled it here and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of the Pryoritisz USA group, which represents the Democrats in the election, told the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided on who they trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more of those standing by the latter.
A new survey conducted by YuGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in an alcoholic state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during a party they attended during their Yale studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup project that aims to become a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be able to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company magazine, Berners-Li joked that the intent behind the Inrupt project was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "personal space for online data storage", or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal space for online data storage is that it depends solely on the user who can access what information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide the resources, process, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several permanent developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In an announcement on the Medium platform on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and one ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
Berners-Li transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the influential voices in the debate on net neutrality.
>>bos_Latn<< Although launching Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new era of the network,” Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: A tribute to the priest from World War I, bearer of the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I is honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Col. Bernard Van earned this decoration on 29 September 1918 during the attack at Belangliz and Leokur.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had received Britain's highest military medal.
>>bos_Latn<< His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque on Saturday during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the record was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat his grandfather had earned.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog, under fierce artillery and machine-gun fire."
He then stormed the line of fire and, with "the greatest heroism," led the attack before independently attacking the artillery and ejecting three crew members from the machine.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but something that deserves a lot of respect.”
>>bos_Latn<< He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to have participated in the parade" and added "the heroism of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many people will give him."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Belator 206, and instead get Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, and that you would be prevented from watching the main event.
The San Jose event included 13 fights, including six in the main section and in the UK it was shown live at night on channel 5.
>>bos_Latn<< At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Musasi and Rory Macdonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the transmission switched to Pepa Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying up until the early morning precisely because of that fight.
One fan described switching to a children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to transfer it to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"'Pepa Pig', yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Cocker said he would work on his programming scheme to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think in terms of reruns, I think we’ll probably be able to sort that out,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won’t be able to fix it until Sunday, Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to sort it out, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, the problem was with the state.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We'll stick to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - we've tried to give fans more than usual and we've simply gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
Speaking on Radio 4 in the first edition of the Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
>>bos_Latn<< He also said he was less concerned about winning the Olympics since he became a parent.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Giving the impression of a rejected person in Laverne's first broadcast, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of being less valuable and different were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone and something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
>>bos_Latn<< The two-time bronze Olympic medallist became a prominent LGBT rights fighter and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke up because he felt lucky to be able to live openly, without consequences, and because he wanted others to “hope.”
The three-time world champion says he was "surprised" by falling in love with the man, American director Dustin Lens Black, whom he met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married an Oscar-winning man 20 years his senior, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" - he went to the first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, having a son, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and the Daily said his "reading perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robi is my Olympic gold medal."
>>bos_Latn<< His son bears the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being discovered to have brain cancer.
Daly says his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and that one of his last questions was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Dad, you won’t live to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and when he died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
>>bos_Latn<< The following year the Daily competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
This feeling was also inspired by his choice of the first song "Praud" by Heather Smoll, who resonated with him in the preparations for the Olympics and from which he continues to get chills.
The Desert Island show is being broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15am UK summer time.
Mikelson to be benched for Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mikelson will set a record Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape to avoid remembering the opportunity.
>>bos_Latn<< Michelson, who for a record 12th time participates in this two-year event, captain Jim Furik sent to the bench for Saturday games with four balls and games of alternating kicks.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been in the United States, the five-time champion will spend part of his time as a fan and part working on his game on the field in the hope of correcting what is troubling him.
Since he was not the most accurate in long-range shots at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf Nasional narrow course, where long segments of tall grass punish mistakes.
And if the pitch itself isn’t discouraging enough, Mikelson faces British Open champion Francesca Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in 12 individual matches, have a tough start, Mikelson’s match could absolutely be crucial.
Furik said he had confidence in his man, though he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, he patted me on the back, he hugged me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furik said.
“There is a lot of self-confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and even this week.
I probably didn't plan on him playing two matches.
I planned more, but that's how it turned out and that's the way we decided we should go.
>>bos_Latn<< He wanted to be there as much as anyone else."
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most weekly matches played in the Ryder Cup.
>>bos_Latn<< It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never actually reached the heights of his personal record.
Mikelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furik said his absence was felt in the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to joke around with people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to tease him this week as well, which was fun to watch.
>>bos_Latn<< He provides much more than the game itself."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage may soon disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant advantage on the eve of the last day of individual matches at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderama, where the side led by Seve Balesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans but eventually pulled away by a hair, winning by a score of 141–2-131–2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage at Valderami; we had a big advantage at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderami, where we won, it was barely,” Bjorn (pictured) says after watching a 5-3 win in the 2018 class on Friday and yesterday for a 10-6 lead at the Le golf nasional field.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not the end of it.
We're going full steam tomorrow.
Let's get out there and do it right.
Nothing is over until you have points on the table.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that will remain the focus.
I keep saying that, focusing on the 12 players on our side, but also how aware we are of who stands on the opposite side - the best players in the world."
Delighted with his players' play on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run before the ore for that matter.
Tomorrow is something completely different.
Tomorrow, the individual effect comes to the fore, and that requires a different game.
It's nice to be there with your partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, then your full golfing ability is on the table.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he also has to come out and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furik will demand from his players a better individual performance than the one they achieved with partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these big turns in the final day, first as part of the winning team at Brooklyn and then as a loser when the European team performed the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember literally every word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain from 1999, had raised morale for his players as they prepared for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to have a quick start like the one you saw in Brooklyn and the one you saw in Medina.
When this enthusiasm goes in one direction, great pressure is exerted on the central matches.
We're making our lineup accordingly and we're doing the guys the way we think they should, you know, we're trying to do a little bit of magic tomorrow."
>>bos_Latn<< Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the final match, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I went with this group of guys in that order because I think that’s how we cover it to the end,” Bjorn commented on his selection for individual matches.
New Postponement for the New German Warship
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but won't arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and mounting costs, local media said.
The launch of Rhineland-Falc, the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wirttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Cajt, which quoted a military spokesman.
>>bos_Latn<< The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems marred the future of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wirttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is known to possess a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance-free operation - it should be possible for the newest frigate to spend up to two years sailing out of her home port.
However, the constant delay means that these state-of-the-art warships -- which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power at sea -- will already be obsolete the moment they enter service.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to receive the vessel and returned it to the Blom and Fos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited more crucial "software and hardware defects" that would make this warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as Baden-Wirttemberg-class vessels would be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the men from the older Bremen-class frigates.
>>bos_Latn<< Also, it turned out that the ship's weight was drastically exceeded, which would have reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to upgrade it later.
The Rhineland-Falc is thought to weigh 7,000 tons, twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the phallic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - also began to be a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from an initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigate in particular come to light in light of recent warnings of a decline in German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, confirmed that the Navy was actually "running out of serviceable ships".
This official pointed out that the problem with time is becoming more and more serious, because ships are being spent without the introduction of replacement vessels.
>>bos_Latn<< He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wirttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Fund eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted on an estate in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use geographical features of the terrain in search of food.
The researchers hope the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
>>bos_Latn<< Research by scientists from the National Endowment for Scotland will follow common and dwarf blind muscles, as well as brown long-eared lilies and watery evening primroses at Inver Garden in the Vester Ross area.
>>bos_Latn<< Special imaging devices will be placed at key locations throughout the estate in order to monitor bat activity during the season.
>>bos_Latn<< Staff and volunteers of the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) will also conduct mobile testing with handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis from all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the bats' voices and what kind it does.
Then a detailed habitat map will be prepared with the report to get a picture of their behavior in relation to the terrain.
Rob Dwar, a conservation consultant at the Fund, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat editing such as meadow creation, as well as how forests can best be managed for the benefit of bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has dropped significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
>>bos_Latn<< Wind generators and lighting also pose a risk, as do adhesive tape for flies and some types of chemical treatments for building materials and domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They rely on a sophisticated echo-location technique to determine the exact position of insects and obstacles on the trajectory they are flying.
The NTS Fund, which is responsible for the care of over 270 buildings of historical importance, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
>>bos_Latn<< The fund has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check nesting sites, and sometimes rescue actions.
>>bos_Latn<< This organisation even established the first and only dedicated reserve for bats in Scotland, at the Triv estate in the Damfries and Galoway area, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says this property is ideal territory for them.
“Here in Triv we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habitat in general.
But much about bats is still unknown, so working here and on other estates will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before performing maintenance work on the property, because by accidentally destroying one nesting site, it is possible to kill up to 400 females and cubs and thus possibly wipe out the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them and destroy their nesting sites.
>>bos_Latn<< Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Blind Mice Protection Fund, encourages the public to get involved and make their contribution.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don’t know how they fare with numbers.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations, lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
>>bos_Latn<< His lawyers intend to sue the German magazine Spiegel which published the allegations.
Juventus and Portugal have been accused of raping an American woman named Katrin Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly then paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Speigl over allegations they described as "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns".
The lawyer, Christian Scherz, said the footballer would seek compensation "for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
>>bos_Latn<< The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to a statement given to the District Court in Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga said Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "99 percent good" but that he had given in because of the "one percent".
>>bos_Latn<< The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was on a voluntary basis.
Majorga also claimed she went to the police with photos of her injuries taken in hospital, but that she subsequently accepted an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrible fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
>>bos_Latn<< This 34-year-old says she now wants to void the settlement because she still has trauma over the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was a step away from moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would never regret' loss of car maker
The UK “would never be too sorry” if it loses its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, says Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production at Barnaston near Darby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan's auto maker says delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cause job losses.
The factory in Barnaston - which produces the auris and avensis Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that we will have a production shutdown at the factory if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota’s Barnaston plant.
Other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns relate to supply chains risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit, carmakers say.
Toyota’s production line operates on an on-time basis, where parts for ordered cars arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a standstill at the border, which industry representatives say could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store inventory for more than a day at its Darbishire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us, as I would say, not only to succeed at the moment, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC 4 radio today.
“The testimonies not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, say that we absolutely must be able to continue what has proven to be a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production shutdown would last, but warned that in the long run, cost accruals would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is a member of the company’s union, says its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are cut, they won’t open anymore.
A government spokesman said: “We have come up with a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as fighting over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s involvement in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will remove his deputy attorney general has been the subject of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing wiretaps to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected that allegation.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite announcements that he was preparing to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to replace Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Kristin Blazi Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein, she said: "It's not yet set a date, it could be this week, it could be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always try to inform the press in a timely manner."
Some reporters may dispute the claim: Sanders failed to deliver a White House press release on September 10th.
>>bos_Latn<< Headmaster Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the thinning of the statement was not due to a reluctance to "get the attention" of journalists, but she said: "I wouldn't refuse to agree with the fact that they like to get the attention."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be stepped up.
“The president has more conferences answering questions than any other president before him,” she said, without citing sources.
There will still be press releases, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it a lot of times over the last few weeks, and that’s going to happen instead of a press release when you have a chance to talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or news conferences with visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, since he acted nonchalantly and bizarrely in front of the gathered journalists.
Health minister writes to EU workers at Scotland's National Health Service over Brexit fears
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland's National Health Service to express her country's gratitude and urged them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament member Jean Freeman sent a letter at a time when there are less than six months left before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of settled applications for EU citizens working in its competent public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations on the UK’s exit from the EU continued throughout the summer, moving towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
>>bos_Latn<< But the UK government is also working to prepare for a possible scenario without reaching an agreement.
I know this must be an upsetting time for all of you.
So now I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring us valuable experience and skills that empower and enhance the work of healthcare services, for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Kristion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After Head Injury
>>bos_Latn<< Linebacker Tennessee State Tigers Kristion Abercrombie was rushed into surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat with a score of 31-27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the head injury occurred just before half-time.
“He got to the out line and there he just collapsed,” Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the car before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further testing.
>>bos_Latn<< An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville in Tennessee that Abercrombie had been transported to Vanderbilt Medical Center to be operated on.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the nature/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of tax marks when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of tax marks when buying real estate in the UK, and additional income will be used to help homeless people in line with new Tories plans
This move will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
Increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK - and additional income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in an effort to attract young voters by promising to give them more affordable housing and shift the tax burden to those on high pay.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay tax in the UK, and additional money will be used to contribute to the government’s fight against homelessness.
The additional burden - which is added to an already existing tax stamp, including higher amounts introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of real estate for rent - could amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this step to raise up to 120 million pounds annually.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents, raising prices and making it difficult for people buying their first home to get to a residential area.
Many wealthy parts of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new regulation comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax stamp to help young people get to their first home.
He accused major construction firms of holding high property prices by hijacking the land but not using it and urged Prime Minister May to scrap quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "disgrace with housing".
Korbin announced a striking array of housing reform proposals, including rent control and an end to unjustified evictions.
It also wants to give committees greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to renewing the British dream of making life better for every new generation.
And this also means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
>>bos_Latn<< However, it cannot be right to make buying a property as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies as it is for working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, while the humiliation of homelessness has become too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.”
Sanderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's national team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in the major leagues, three points from the top.
>>bos_Latn<< This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was on the team's B-team and that's it," Ross told the Sportsaund show on the Scottish BBC.
“But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was little, and that was something I always came back to.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I was successful in running the club."
>>bos_Latn<< Ross' predecessors as Sanders managers include Dick Advocate, David Mojiz, Sam Allerdys, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keene, Gas Poet, and Paolo di Kani.
>>bos_Latn<< The former head of Aloa Athletic says he did not dread coming after such big names to such a big club, having declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .
"The measure of success at this point will be whether I can get this club back in the Premier League."
According to the structure and capabilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross is only in his third year of his managerial career, after a period spent as assistant chief at Dumbarton and 15 months spent on Harts' coaching staff.
>>bos_Latn<< He then helped Aloa recover from falling into the third division, and St Mirren led from the brink of falling into the minor leagues to the championship winners the following season.
>>bos_Latn<< Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said, recalling the takeover of the Aloa club.
“I really believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn’t bad, I made a solid profit from it, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
>>bos_Latn<< I still go through it in terms of stresses and pressures of work, but management just suits me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, and in all my adult life I’ve never felt more comfortable than I do now.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17.30 on Saturday, research reveals
>>bos_Latn<< The summer heat wave increased traffic for British pubs struggling to survive, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In the group of pubs and bars, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July - but the turnover in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which processed the figures, said: “The continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs saw a 2.8 per cent growth, in addition to restaurants having an even greater decline.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant traffic in June only worsened further in July.
>>bos_Latn<< Drink-focused pubs and bars had by far the best effect with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than was the decline in restaurant traffic.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Pub and bar chains increased beverage sales by 6.6 percent in a month, with food sales down three percent."
Paul Newman from the RSM agency for entertainment and hospitality analysis says: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain major factors when it comes to sales in the non-household market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the decline of 4.8% per year will be particularly painful with price pressures already present.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide little over-relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
>>bos_Latn<< Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry-wide sales tracking service in the bar, pub and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is an accepted industry benchmark.

One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and educators, a study finds.
A survey of more than 20,000 high school seniors found an increase in the number of “fake Insta” sites.
The news has increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “master” order to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - make social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school seniors found a sharp rise in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "master" order that they show to their parents, but also have private orders.
A mother who stumbled across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter has discovered a teenage girl calling others “rape me.”
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, while half of them admitted to owning private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eileen Doyle to be 'voice of an athlete' at Scottish Athletics Board
Aley Doyle was elected a member of the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual general session of that governing body.

“I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope to be able to really contribute to and help run the sport in Scotland.”

Milk pump ad comparing mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company that makes milking pumps has shared opinions on the internet with an advertisement that compares nursing cows to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which has been described as "the first silent milking pump worn under bras", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released a humorous advertisement showing the freedom that the new pump provides to milking mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn among hay and cows with a song that says, "Yes, I'm milking myself but I don't have a tail" and "You may not have noticed, but that's not udder, that's my boobs."
The chorus continues, "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself."
>>bos_Latn<< However, an advertisement posted on the firm's Facebook page sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video elicited different reactions from viewers, while many said it downplayed the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but with them their babies are snatched a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Someone else commented: “It’s clearly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "That's a thoughtless advertisement."
Others sided with the commercial, and one woman admitted that her song was "hilarious".
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd get this if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny advertisement directed at moms who milk out (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
>>bos_Latn<< This is not an advertisement that praises or curates the dairy industry."
>>bos_Latn<< At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they have all danced with discrete pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who milk out milk say that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and stops in the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while milking.
Ana Ballarin, Mother’s partner and chief creative officer, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milking and all the challenges that go along with it, presenting in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
>>bos_Latn<< It was not the first time Elvie's pump had made the news headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway with the creation of Marta Jakubovski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Secretly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that crossing the border on a monthly basis has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and regulations introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to find guardians.
Traditionally, most guardians themselves were undocumented migrants who were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albens told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
>>bos_Latn<< The service later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been convicted.
“Nearly 80% of persons who are either guardians or members of the guardians’ household are illegal in this country, and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal offenses.
So we will continue to pursue those faces," Albens said.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, a previous standard, the shelter workers say.
Many will respond with a video call instead of a face-to-face call to the immigration judge to ask for their status to be legitimized.
>>bos_Latn<< Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain incarcerated, the higher the chance they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outburst of anger or an attempt to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that such risks are elevated in larger institutions like the one in Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook the signs that a child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without providing enough time for emotional preparation or forgiveness from friends can intensify the traumas many are already struggling with.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will deal with them appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its “sacred fight until all Syrian terrorists are exterminated,” including terrorist groups and “every foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, tasked mainly with training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
When it comes to refugees, Muallem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that keep refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow this return," he said.
“They’re politicizing something that would be purely a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for Syria's reconstruction until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deterred a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be launched against jihadists, including Nusra fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who would "be exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
>>bos_Latn<< Mualem laid out the Syrian government's terms of participation in the committee, saying the committee's work would be limited to "considering members of the current constitution" and threatened the possibility of interference from the sidelines.
Why Trump Will Be Elected For A Second Term
By that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal earlier end his term.
This would undoubtedly represent “the most dramatic end to a presidential term of all time!”
So far, no sign of viewer fatigue.
>>bos_Latn<< As of 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled, to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, as opposed to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Meadow Show on MSNBC surpassed cable ratings of 3.5 million viewers during prime time.
"It's a flame that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Burr, a producer of the ABC drama The Chosen Survivor, about the minister who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol building.
Nel Scovel, a longtime comedy author and author of Only Funny Parts: And a Few Harsh Truths About Getting Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" she told me.
Chaos has a lot of fun too.

Large cash flow from the side in the most uncertain election race for the House of Representatives for half of the term
Unsurprisingly, the influx of money swept Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district, thanks to the redistricting that brought the two officials into the race for the same position.
The recent redrawing of the district's borders in the Pittsburgh suburbs has led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lem, who came to the helm of the second district after snap elections last spring.
Lem is opposed to another official, Republican Keith Rotfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
>>bos_Latn<< The maps were corrected after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided so that the vote went in favor of the Republicans.
>>bos_Latn<< The election race in the new 17th district launched a fierce campaign finance competition between the main party financiers, the Democratic Congressional Election Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Election Committee (NRCC).
>>bos_Latn<< Lem became a sound name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March snap election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district that garnered much attention.
He was a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.

U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Quits
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing's position, without particularly negative reaction from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump administration team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions to withdraw Taiwan’s recognition,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
>>bos_Latn<< But sanctions were only considered in the case of El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, among other things for narcotics control, development, and economic support.
>>bos_Latn<< The proposed sanctions, which included ceasing to provide financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would hit this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates hard.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a follow-up to last year's similar gathering seen as a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus put an end to any consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was announced as a speaker at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the importance the administration attributes to the gathering, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
>>bos_Latn<< Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next bad news could come in the form of a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible Trump obstruction of justice, for which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mueller is reportedly also pursuing an investigation into possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia’s attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress moves into second hands, Trump could face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go before voters again, and perhaps before a jury.
There are many “ifs” there, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, not even the downfall of the likes of him in Europe.
There are choices that each of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make that will determine how long the fight lasts.

We made a mistake and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
>>bos_Latn<< The course of history revolves around such tipping points at which the unstoppable march of history is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are now faced with more such tipping points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the future of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an awkward position since the newspaper reported last year that he had proposed secretly shooting the president and made speculations that he was unfit to hold office.
Rosenstein said the Times deposition was incorrect.
"How will we react if the FBI's recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that's going to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the country where I was ambassador.

Rangers player Graham Dorans optimistic ahead of Vienna's Rapido
Rangers will host Rapida from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a good position to qualify for the Europa League from Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his debut this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he is confident the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for progress.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
"We got into the game believing we could achieve something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten away with it, but overall, the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second and we were better.
We have another big European night coming up on Thursday.
We hope that we can take three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last game, although if the audience supports us, I am sure that we can push through and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened with my injuries and until the changes at the club, but now we are satisfied with what we have at the moment.
>>bos_Latn<< The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope we can now push forward, put the previous season behind us and achieve success."
Women can't sleep worrying about retirement savings
>>bos_Latn<< Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be taken care of, few people discussed this with their family members.
About half of the faces in the Nationwide survey said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don’t want to start a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to be given care, as such decisions can be a significant factor in pricing.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that would help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own savings - provided you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Prevent legal battles.
Make medical aid decision-making authority to have a trusted person oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals act on your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
>>bos_Latn<< Also, consider concluding a power of attorney contract for finances.
This involves choosing a person of trust who would make financial decisions on your behalf and making sure that your bills are paid if you remain powerless.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your aging parent getting sick and being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Provide this information in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, it’s the question of who the doctors are,” Martin says.
“What medications are used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan it."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
>>bos_Latn<< Due to communications disruptions, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal area, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
>>bos_Latn<< Over 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongali on the island of Sulawesi:
>>bos_Latn<< Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
>>bos_Latn<< The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The area which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy in Central Sulawesi Province, and especially in the coastal part of Dongale.
>>bos_Latn<< Nickel mines are also important in this province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have suffered multiple tsunami impacts in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
>>bos_Latn<< The tsunami struck again in the western part of Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
>>bos_Latn<< Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific belt of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
>>bos_Latn<< 2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the shores of the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh province.
>>bos_Latn<< 2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
>>bos_Latn<< Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
>>bos_Latn<< 2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that splashed the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
>>bos_Latn<< 2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.

Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
>>bos_Latn<< Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and running mate Sarah Palin, was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack.
Palin, 29, from Vasile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructed reporting of domestic violence, and resisted arrest, according to a report released by the Alaskan police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit and given a $500 conditional bail, the KTUU channel reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "not guilty, certainly" when asked to plead guilty, the channel said.
>>bos_Latn<< Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
>>bos_Latn<< He was also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
>>bos_Latn<< In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
>>bos_Latn<< His mother, Sara Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
>>bos_Latn<< In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reporting domestic violence, and handling of a weapon in an alcoholic state during the course of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran associations after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD originating from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake triggers tsunami: Hundreds killed
>>bos_Latn<< At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
>>bos_Latn<< There has been a disruption in telecommunications and electricity supply, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesi located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media recording the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami washed ashore.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck to attack a bike path along a western highway in lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a death penalty request filed in New York’s Southern District.
>>bos_Latn<< Both of these points carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight charges of manslaughter in connection with racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically raise in cases involving organized crime and charges of violent behavior and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov had performed it as "gross, cruel and corrupt".
"Sajfulo Habibulaevich Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lor Dekad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Feruchi, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damijan Panjuk," the statement said.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last had a case in which the death penalty was threatened.
>>bos_Latn<< The accused Halid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was carried out in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
>>bos_Latn<< Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
>>bos_Latn<< He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
>>bos_Latn<< He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
>>bos_Latn<< He stated that he does not accept blame on any of the 22 counts.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of acquittal will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
>>bos_Latn<< The defense of Saipov had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
The Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" today during a Tory conference protest.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must "feel the discontent" of eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have “already come out” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided membership has been highlighted by Tories who advocate staying in the EU and have staged a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to salvage her Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by both Brexit supporters and opponents of the EU.
Allies insist that she will continue to make efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of negative reactions - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told a rally in Solihala that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
>>bos_Latn<< He suggested that Faraj should have been given the nobility and be in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingboro added: “I will support Brexit, but we must reject Chequers.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight wars to be subordinate.
>>bos_Latn<< We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Bowne dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins, who was also at the rally, told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who actually roam the streets and allow us to be elected at all.
“Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening.”
In a criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must "feel discontent" if they are going to play out the promise they made in a 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political elites," he said.
“They’re trying to play Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to get our political elite, which is one step away from playing Brexit, to feel discontent.
“We are mobilizing the People’s Army in this country that gave us the victory at Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved "Tories against Brexit" banners after forming a group this weekend.
A Labour nobleman, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives at the start of the conference because of the security problems they had with the party app.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can put in place the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plan, for the invisible border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
No good Brexit is possible,” he added.
Warren plans to think twice about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think twice about running for president" after November's election.
>>bos_Latn<< The Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future at a meeting with the city administration in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
>>bos_Latn<< Around her there are speculations that she could run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday night's rally in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in conference format with the city administration since Trump took office.
Someone asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and take out our dysfunctional government, and that includes the woman at the top.”
Man arrested in shooting that killed LSU player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Dajon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11.00 am Eastern American time.
>>bos_Latn<< They released a video of the shooting on Friday and sought help in identifying the man seen on the video.
>>bos_Latn<< Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Sadern University early on Friday.
"Wayd Simms was shot in the head, which resulted in his being injured," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports portal.
>>bos_Latn<< Wade stepped up in his friend's defense when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted in interrogation that he was on the scene, that he owned a gun, and that he shot Wade Sims.
>>bos_Latn<< Simpson was arrested unopposed and given detention at a police station in the municipality of East Baton Rouge.
Sim, a 198 cm tall youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games of which 10 in the first set, with an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
>>bos_Latn<< Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton approached the title of world champion after following team tactics to win over Sebastian Fetel.
As soon as Valtteri Botas qualified ahead of Luis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a major role in the race.
Bottas started well from pole position, almost leaving Lewis Hamilton in the lurch as he defended his position in the first two corners and called on Fetel to attack a member of his team.
>>bos_Latn<< Fetel first entered the pit-stop and left Hamilton rushing into the crowd from the back of the group, which was to be decisive.
>>bos_Latn<< Mercedes' team went pit-stop on the next lap and found themselves behind Fetel but Hamilton fronted after contact with wheels causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the inside position risking the position after a double move in an attempt to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He was then in the lead for most of the race and relied on the tyres to quickly come close to winning and overtaking Kimi Rykonen in fourth position.
>>bos_Latn<< He eventually went to pit-stop in the 44th lap but failed to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, and Rajkonen took fourth position.
“It’s been a tough day as Walter has been a great, real gentleman to let me go all weekend.
The team has achieved a lot by taking 1st and 2nd place," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blazi Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
In his address in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but made a comment that what was happening in the Senate was evidence that people were “evil, vicious, and not telling the truth.”
"The only thing that can happen is the wonderful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, you see people who are angry, evil, vicious and not telling the truth," he said.
“When you look at the posts and the leaked information, and then they say, ‘Oh, well, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked any information?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute.
Did we publish them... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh that were leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that information had been leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill magazine.
“She told me the information should remain confidential and I acted as she asked.”
However, her denial to the president was not convincing, and he commented at Saturday's rally: "You know what, it was really bad body language.
It may not be her fault, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In further defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president hinted that Democrats are using those allegations to their own advantage.
“They intended to regain power by not choosing the means.
All that malice and malice; they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to re-emerge and take control," the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dandi Stars - Giants of Belfast 5-3
Patrick Dwyer's two goals for the Giants against Dundee
By winning Saturday's rematch against Dandi by a score of 5-3, the Dundee Stars team redeemed themselves for a lost game against the Belfast Giants in an Elite League match that took place on Friday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilliers led the Giants in the lead by scoring two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowney helped the home team tie the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back into the lead.
>>bos_Latn<< Francois Bucard tied the score for the Dandies before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals ensured their victory.
>>bos_Latn<< It was the third defeat for Adam Kif's team this season in the Elite League, having to contend for the win after losing 2-1 last night in Belfast.
>>bos_Latn<< The two teams have met four times this season, with the Giants taking victory in all three previous matches.
Dwyer's shot opened the match in the fourth minute (3.35) with Kendall McFaul's assist, while David Raderford assisted Bovillier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
>>bos_Latn<< In the crowd at the start, Sullivan's home team returned to the game in the 13th minute and 10th second before Matt Markvart helped Kauni tie in the 15th minute and 16th second.
>>bos_Latn<< Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break after scoring the second goal that evening at the end of the first period.
>>bos_Latn<< The home team regrouped so Bukard tied with a goal again in a power play in the 27th minute and 37th seconds.
Kauni and Charles Korkoran teamed up and helped Nilsen lead the Dandies for the first time in this match before the end of the second period, thus ensuring his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have so far lost four of their last five games, will welcome the Milton Kinz team to the game in front of a home crowd on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring hundreds of passengers on board avoid quake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of planes with several hundred people.
More than 800 people have been killed and a large number have disappeared after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to occur in the area, and large numbers of people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, Antonius Gunavan Agung, 21, refused to leave his workplace at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which is rocked by the quake.
He wouldn’t leave his job until the plane on flight 6321 of the air carrier Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He died a little later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirajt concluded that the decision saved hundreds of people's lives, according to Australian news reports ABC News.
>>bos_Latn<< We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
“Our heart broke when we heard the news,” Sirite added.
Meanwhile, local authorities fear the death toll will reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency warns that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The death toll is thought to be on the rise as many bodies are still under rubble and large numbers of people are difficult to reach,” said Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
>>bos_Latn<< Waves reaching heights of up to six metres have devastated the city of Palu, in which mass burials of earthquake victims will take place on Sunday.
>>bos_Latn<< Military and commercial aviation brings aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency cars bring in bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself but it can get even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night and complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, in which more than 550 people were killed.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air carrier Air Niugini reports one man missing after plane crashes in lagoon
An airliner whose plane crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now reported one man missing, following a previous statement that 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking into the water.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to find the passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline says it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
At first, they did not respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
>>bos_Latn<< Other passengers and crew members were rescued by local boats after the plane hit the surface of the water in an attempt to land at the airport of Chuk Island.
>>bos_Latn<< Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were taken to hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy state that the plane landed in the lagoon, not reaching the runway.
>>bos_Latn<< Some witnesses thought the plane had flown over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Janes said.
Janes added that he and other passengers managed to make their way from the sinking plane with water to the waist to the emergency exit.
He said the plane's crew were panicking and shouting and suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy personnel working near the crash site also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat that carried passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in air accidents involving air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
Analyst Reconstructs the Event of the Night the Woman Burned Alive
>>bos_Latn<< The prosecution brought the case forward on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Roulet spoke for hours in testimony as a forensic expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury he used a list of phone calls to piece together a picture of the whereabouts of the accused, Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, during the night she died.
Roulet said he received location information based on several phone calls that showed Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous claim, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
>>bos_Latn<< When information from Chambers' phone indicated that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, police went to question Sanford.
>>bos_Latn<< Sanford was called to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Roulet said that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted from his phone the messages he had exchanged with her, the call list and her contact.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The final defense is scheduled for Sunday.
>>bos_Latn<< The judge said he expected the trial to be before a jury later the same day.

>>bos_Latn<< The band wants to get back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fujiz and Komon have risen again in the UK through artists like Akala and Louki.
Another black person?
New York Nanny Sues Couple for Dismissal After ‘Racist’ Text Message
The New York nanny sued the couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after receiving a message from her mother by mistake complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, assessing the lawsuit with an act of "extortion".
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, a mother of two, has expressed displeasure after learning that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, is a person of the dark side, upon her first coming to a new job in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms Plasko-Flaskman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Morisova, twice.
When she became aware of the blunder, Plasko-Flaxman felt uneasy and fired Morisova, stating that the friendly nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job poorly and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Morissova received a workday fee and was sent home via Uber.
Morris is now seeking compensation from the couple for their dismissal, as well as $350 per day for a six-month period during which she was to live with her family, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that it’s not right to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the racism charge that cancelling Morris' contract was reasonable because they felt they couldn't trust her after they insulted her.
“Her husband sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," her husband, Joel Plasko, told the Post.
“Would you leave your children to care for the person you offended, even if by mistake?”
Your newborn?
Come on, please."
Judging the lawsuit with the act of "extortion", Plasko added that his wife gave birth just two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
Do you want to chase someone like her?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the process is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media for such behavior and thinking.
New letter reveals: Paddington publisher feared readers won't identify with talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to look at a thing through the eyes of another person reading something for the first time before it’s published.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's tremendous success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about teddy bear, would blush when his book was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bitter-sweet" because her father passed away last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington Bear, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
“He was quiet, he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“Because he thought Paddington was real, it was almost like your child was achieving something you were proud of, even though you weren’t responsible for it.
I think that's how he looked at Paddingtin's success.
Although he was a figment of his imagination, he always attributed all his success to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was quickly sent to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"He regularly called to say that she was very ill, that they did not expect her to survive," Ms Ednan-Laperuz said.
“He called me to tell me that he was going to die in two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tasha, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She passed away a few moments before that and it all just went out.
I just sat there and waited, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry and grieve because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, completely unaware of the horrors she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and tears flowed down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but over the summer, I was overcome by compassion for Hope.
I knew he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women leave motivational messages to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide want to stop people who want to do the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys left inspiring messages and phone numbers on the bridge in Wales that people can call and ask for support.
>>bos_Latn<< Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, who was 13 when he fell into a depression, took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son was a novice cook and had an infectious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said he would light up the room he walked into every time.
However, he quit before he died because he was "in a very dark mood".
>>bos_Latn<< In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m always afraid it will have an effect on him.”
She made these messages “so that people would know that there are people everywhere who are going through the same problems and can talk to them, even if they are friends.
Don't sit there and be quiet - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphries, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark after 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t complain about being moody, depressed, or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was behaving differently.
At Christmas, he was in the worst condition - when the children opened the presents he didn't even look at them."
She added that Mark’s death was a traumatic experience for the children, but they had to overcome it.
We were broken.
>>bos_Latn<< But we had to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain at the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what he was asking for - an investigation of limited duration and scope - maybe we could get together," Ms Flake said on Saturday, adding that she feared the committee was "disintegrating" due to unwavering party dissent.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to start an investigation?
>>bos_Latn<< Their hesitation is caused by time constraints.
Half-term elections will be held in just a few weeks -- November 6 -- if Republicans live up to expectations and fare poorly, they will be seriously weakened in an attempt to get their candidate elected to the highest judicial office in the country.
George W. Bush made calls to the senators, persuading them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI issues a report?
The Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will take him to the polls.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the chance to prevail in a tie and make him a member of the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea under Kim’s rule is declining.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Bjeong-Sug Park, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park believes the two decisive factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in smuggling tariffs.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees eventually acquire South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, with which North Korea shares most of its border and which is easier to cross than the protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea - which technically are still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks whose central theme was the delayed talks on ending the use of nuclear weapons.
The event followed a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, at which they generally agreed to work toward making the Korean peninsula nuclear-free.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical", stating that he is not fit to work with the Supreme Court
U.S. House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nominee “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but notice that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Kristina Blazi Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial exposure, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking during stories about his family and high school days.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations directed against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on his reputation” led by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi says she thought Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not work for the Supreme Court because it showed his bias regarding dissent with Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he treated the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi shyly answered the question of whether she would try to challenge Kavanaugh's impeachment if his candidacy was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he is not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court he is in right now,” Pelosi said.
>>bos_Latn<< Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Rotary Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings over health care laws or in the case of Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
>>bos_Latn<< When making a statement to confirm the candidature, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for hysterical, biased people to work in court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Slander, months and years of rage spilling over, and she can't get it out of her system without shedding a tear.
“Women cry when they’re angry,” Mrs Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think that's a rare occurrence, is it?"
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who was a CEO somewhere, who told me that she cried when she got angry but developed a technique: when she got angry and cried, she would say to her interlocutor, 'You must think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she'd just go on.
And that was genius to me."
Tears are an allowed way to express anger partly because we don’t understand their essence.
One of the strongest memories I have of my previous work in an office where men prevailed and where I once cried out of incredible anger was when an elderly woman grabbed me by the throat - a cold-blooded executive I had always feared - and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called The Monkey Business and retired from the election race, Ms. Schroeder, who was badly defeated, realized that there was no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and only one more was missing.
Someone called this race 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'".
>>bos_Latn<< Since it happened towards the end of the campaign, she did not have enough finances, and vowed not to enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was doomed.
She found out that people who donated $1,000 to support her gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
When she made a speech in which she announced that she would not formally campaign, emotions overwhelmed her - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than their representatives and anger at chauvinism - and she began to choke.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls the press’ reaction to her behavior.
“You’d think the paper towel makers would be my general sponsors.
I remember thinking what they were going to put on my monument.
“She was crying a lot.”
How a trade war between the U.S. and China could be good for Beijing
The cannades at the start of the trade war between the US and China have been deafening, and as there is no end to the battle, the gap between the two countries may be favorable for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by introducing a tax on key items imported from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant impact took place this week when new tariffs on $200 billion (150 billion pounds) worth of items effectively taxing half of goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, the latest example being a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to keep the United States at bay, and the world’s second-largest economy appears unlikely to blink in the near future.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would mean accepting the demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing makes the right move, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by weakening the interdependence of the two economies.
"The mere fact that Washington's hasty political decision could create the conditions for the start of an economic whirlwind in either country is actually much more dangerous than analysts predicted," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
>>bos_Latn<< In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The State Administration continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore a normal way of life.
They have all heard of the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and the establishment of unilateral economic measures that were directed against their lives and daily needs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem says helping the Syrian regime rebuild a devastated country would be welcome.
>>bos_Latn<< However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
>>bos_Latn<< The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in France, defeating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le golf nasional field near Paris.
>>bos_Latn<< The U.S. has thus scored six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
>>bos_Latn<< Europe regained the crown after a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to overtake the United States.
Team USA star Phil Michelson, who suffered for most of the tournament, threw the ball into the water at the 16th par-3 hole and handed his match to Francesca Molinaria.
>>bos_Latn<< Italian golfer Molinari was featured in all rounds and became one of four players with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current format, in 1979.
>>bos_Latn<< American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player on the European team, Torbjorna Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top scorer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
>>bos_Latn<< A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all time with a career score of 25.5.
“I rarely cry, but I couldn’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
“It’s an important team here and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
>>bos_Latn<< The relay passes to his countryman John Ram who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in individual matches on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man,” Ram said.
>>bos_Latn<< Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
Odd statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 of the biggest titles and is only behind Jack Nicklas.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furrick said after his team's disappointing game: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, we'll work with the Professional Golfers' Union of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're stoned."
