Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little depressed.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps whining about not having time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it fast.
She didn't even blink.
What did all this mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
>>bos_Latn<< It would mean something to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the job done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappoint me.
It's no big deal.
How much do I get?
I'm teasing you.
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left my keys.
Where'd you get that scar?
You wouldn't think it by her looks, but the story of the child who ate two cakes is from her childhood.
I can't live that life.
Tom's as hungry as a wolf.
It was a difficult decision.
Everybody's crying.
Octopus Paul was right.
He loves football very much.

I think that's completely ridiculous.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
How old is your car?
Check, please.
Make sure the cat is outside and the door is locked when you leave.
It remains to be seen if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget about Tom.
I work as a freelance translator.
Tom got nervous with his fingers on the table.
Did you go out last night?
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like the instrumental music.
You should thank Tom with a letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?

Forget I said that.
I failed.

Can you save me a few cookies?
I'm allergic to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolates.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not letting this go.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I drop that?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because he's a male chauvinist pig.
I've been all over Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get out of this?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, let me know.
I've been looking for you.
I don’t think much of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Is that what you told Tom?
Everybody's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where was she going?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.

The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I passed every test.
I'm sick of your whining.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll see.
He's very busy now.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kylie Minogue from June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
Yesterday I went to bed without brushing my teeth.
Danger lurks in every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're getting careless.
Is it necessary to make so much noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't escape the past.
Please forgive me for being late.

I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be OK.
>>bos_Latn<< The family had dinner at noon.
I thought you were taking the Bosto bus.
They'll clean my room.
Tom and I aren't friends, we're just workmates.

Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.

We have to work hard.
You're very beautiful.

Let’s talk about the possibilities.
I was just about to suggest you do that.

I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Jom brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - a mountain range located at the bottom of the ocean, at depths of up to 4,500 meters.
Yeah, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament was dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree to that.
You seem like a very intelligent person.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and approached the window.
It was something that led to a flood of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's heavy.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was pushy.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.

Did you tell Tom this?
You'll destroy your eyesight if you play games all the time.
I'm an Earthling.
I can read different languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are gonna happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
It'll take me a while to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We don't want to get stranded.
You're kind of right.
Even though I told Tom not to open the door, he did.
Go straight.
It's as simple as beans.
I'm good at a lot of things.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'll quit school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
You're wasting your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was accelerating.
Try this.
There are no consequences.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom will go.
Is any of this real?
What are you going to do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not to eat after 7 p.m.
I'm sure Tom is proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.
You were right to shave.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom many times.

We need your help.
Has Tom been notified?
Tofu goes well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I don't feel like swimming.
She's as pretty as her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some room.
It doesn't stand.
That's enough, Tom.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom intended to ask his boss for a raise, but changed his mind.
Come inside.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
>>bos_Latn<< Most scientists rejected the theory of continental displacement, because it was so hard to imagine plate motions were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need each day.
Tom will change.
I reacted instinctively.
You have to do it somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload videos to YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everybody knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you fully recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining hard.
Tom's sick today.
That's what both of them like.

I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful.
You've got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Start counting.
You must never come back.
He's a man of flesh and blood with all his flaws.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
Come back tomorrow.
He ended up in prison.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink the water.
I will always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom's saving money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't see you out.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man is promoted in front of a woman - this is called favoritism. If she is promoted, in front of a man, it is called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Be back in an hour.
Tom uses that word a lot.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I'm here.
We are what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut your filthy mouth.

I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you going back now?
She must be over sixty.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.

Plato is a friend, but truth is a greater friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a moller.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're absolutely right.
They can never do it otherwise than by force.
I thought I'd get another chance at it.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half past three.
I don't know if that'll be enough money for me.
Can you draw the curtains?
Have you tried it before?
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he'd tied his seat belt.
It looked yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I am strongly opposed to compromise.
Everything comes at a price.
Tom picked up Mary.
I might not sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.

Everybody laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't fight.
Just be careful, Tom.
I'll understand.
I'm in better shape than you are.
Maybe they're around the lake somewhere.
I wish I'd known.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Cut it out, Tom.
It is impossible to say with certainty.
Tom's never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Begin.
It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife is not sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an officer of the old intelligence service who would like to reclaim the old empire of that country.
Would you like some more tea?
The nail punctured a tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
>>bos_Latn<< Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
Little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom is still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets furious if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope it's dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
Did you wash the dishes?
>>bos_Latn<< When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't stare.
Do you have a real one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save all of us time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everyone else did.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It’s hard to give up long-term love at once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
A strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this over lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We must respect our personal rights.
What's that thing on your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he couldn't.
Jumi's gonna be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is a Yugoslav.
There's got to be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but did not send it to her.
He has a good memory.
The limbs are numb from the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're sincere.
Come play with us.
Do you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't stretch out.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
>>bos_Latn<< It took four kilograms of gold to gild the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to put numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't shout.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income is down 10 percent.
It can be difficult to get around unfamiliar terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After much consideration, I ended up making things at random.
It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're shrinking.
Can you talk to me?
Turn the TV down.
I wear short-sleeved shirts in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom hoped to become a celebrated writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me poems he wrote when he was a teenager.

Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just on my way.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'm coming home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
>>bos_Latn<< If there is no porn with that, porn will be made with that.
Canada is the mother country of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving up so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is without a doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road leads to the city.
I'm not happy about it.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
Stop watching TV and start studying.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never noticed that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad.
I'm tired of fighting.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't shout.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on her math exam.
No one else was allowed in the room.
Better by grace than by force.
You're in trouble.
There is no “freedom” in the Russian language.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's run away.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I wasn't told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary.
I assumed this would happen months ago.
Bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never take me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
That's a quick fattening.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing multiple things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your foolish business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving up to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
>>bos_Latn<< The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You failed me.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom manages to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
I just won't do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It is their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Will we ever see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
>>bos_Latn<< Avoid addicts on paint thinner.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
Tom's easy to hang out with.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom twirled around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how that is possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
>>bos_Latn<< We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black grand piano with dramatic finger strokes, creating music that is very enjoyable to listen to.
>>bos_Latn<< Strong winds broke off many branches from the trees last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
>>bos_Latn<< There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
It's time to get up.
>>bos_Latn<< The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partially responsible.
People were nice to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
I could come with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom plans to do.
To join the choir, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom took a nap.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I take vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is beneficial for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself priority over the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Insensitive, numb children can grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like it to be at your place.
It's the police's job to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning really fast.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hate of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
The monks knew how to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep children away from medication.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Drive to work for an hour and a half.
It's the right thing.
Your time will soon come.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll think of something.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think such views are madness.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write a single letter to Mary while he was away.
We've had enough of you.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
We need to be prudent.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom's got a big end to it.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a little nauseous.
Is this the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great suffering.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Explore this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Please help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I disagree.
I am a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter were two generations old.
>>bos_Latn<< He plotted to himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
Resting my legs.
I really like to exercise.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
Time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The debrief on the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
It was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." "And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review of Mac." "...Yes."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don’t have to eat right before you go to sleep.
Tom will wait.
The students didn’t know how to respond.
I'm not a night owl.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm the one who should be doing this.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit a torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's truth in what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
>>bos_Latn<< The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm looking into it right now.
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
The two sides will make speeches this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in plaster.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
Tom needs help.
Defend yourselves.
He took a taxi to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he sleeps.
Tom's unfit.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.
These are your choices.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I've seen dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient died.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to be leaving.
The eagle is the king of birds.
The fire broke out on the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've got this all wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm grounded.
The cat lay stretched out the whole length in the sunlight penetrating through the window.
Do you go to school on foot or by bicycle?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed by it.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, a beautiful face and a young body, are of transitory value.
I saw a mouse.
He's trying.
The two countries have negotiated a peace treaty.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That's what sleep is for.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm in the habit of doing that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
She's right out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
>>bos_Latn<< Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old-fashioned way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at it again.
Sounds like a betrayal to me.
That's what you need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Below the drawing, he wrote "Snatch the hot dogs!".
Drive slow.
What a man you are!
Twice measure, once cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulates our learning at the same time. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. After all, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She was fingering the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I wasn't interested.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything strange.
You're never on time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll make sure I don't disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
>>bos_Latn<< All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom will make progress.
Tom was scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt a bit.
We have to escape.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was in pain.
All or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I contributed.
I'll sign.
Embarrass him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom is rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope he'll be all right.
The wind has calmed down.
I have a floor-to-ceiling mirror in my bedroom.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Don't say anything.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-check festival took place in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I have no desire to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy talks like he's an adult.
Carrots cost three dollars.
My bike is new.
Tom told me today that he loves me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
I've tried that before.
Go upstairs.
Parking is not allowed there.
Bigam wound.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how he makes himself important.
How long have you been here?
Tom is a passionate cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's have a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family moved around a lot.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't stare.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom just happened to be wired.
Is he an Arab or a Hindu?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I put my hat.
He's pissed off again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't make a sound!
Who doesn't?
Tom does that sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
Tom nibbles his nails.
He was a man who never hesitated to stand up.
There is probably a periodic occurrence of rabies because floating ice from Siberia can carry polar foxes on them.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I’ve been having memory problems lately.
I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Do I ever make a mistake?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget him.
I agreed to buy it.
What does the newspaper say?
>>bos_Latn<< The surface temperature of the sun is about 6000°C.
Sami asked a lot of questions about Islam
If we leave now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to know what really happened.
She ran her fingers through her hair.
Tom works hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says there are four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom has to say.
I'm starving.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting older.
I don't entirely agree with you.
There are many possible answers to this question.
Let's eat the ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you play.
It is difficult to put what we have said into practice.
How long have you had a headache?
Ole, the oldest eel in the world, had just died.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a collage on the top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father's so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I wish I could paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don’t know what hasn’t been, yet or just before, been good, but many times when I’ve tried to log on to the site today, I couldn’t do it.
Do I usually look happy?
I went there of my own free will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
>>bos_Latn<< The prisoner was quickly recaptured.
Everything seemed possible at the time.
I faxed the map to Tom.
I have a memory problem these days.
Tom might not make the meeting.
Tom died almost immediately.
The judge hit him with a hammer.
They also found that the same miscalculation was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't stare.
He should be able to change.
Does Tom have cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the agreed period, a proportional allowance of rent will be charged.
Why should I tell Tom?

Are we safe now?
We are who we are.
He's not honest at all.
Great!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've been a big help.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't stretch out.
Gold isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Are we all here?
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
Faith can move mountains.
I'm not giving up!
Tom fell off the truck while feeding the reindeer.
Tom became a plseach even though his parents wore it to wish.
I think we've met before.
I've made mistakes before.

This is treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under a coconut tree.
Everybody laughed.
I'm tougher than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started to rain.
Tom likes to be busy.
First things first.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little depressed.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on the blinker.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed before 11 o'clock.
Is everybody crazy?
What are you eating anyway?
He's so weird.
This is where I draw the line.
Pay attention to the school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I have another one?
They all ran away.
I've already written to Tom.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom had to re-write the composition.
You want in?
I knew I shouldn't have gotten involved in your crazy business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really that happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Has Tom changed his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
>>bos_Latn<< His younger brother is a famous footballer.
I was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does it work?
Will we ever see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
It's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be difficult.
She's making him meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.
How are you feeling today?
That needs a reason.

Are we starting soon?

I'm starving.
Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.

I don't know anything about her.
You just got shot.

Seniors should pay for their hats and dresses.
Am I seeing things?
Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan anyway?
You're supposed to be here at 1:30 at the latest.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a hippopotamus at the zoo.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of his word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke in two.
Muriel is now 20.
Did you eat anything?
Did you go to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a window made of glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
You'll feel better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom is a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
The problem is that it is too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, if only they had that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Come have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< They were evacuated to the American Field Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We have to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly hurt.
If you need help, let me know.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was kind of weird.
Does he read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
It was all an accident.
Tom's never even seen us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now a word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help himself.
Time for bed.
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you get the hair dryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can think of can help.
Many predictions do not come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I feel bad.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man of many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
He was Mary’s first love.
>>bos_Latn<< The motion was carried out by a vote of hands up.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm deaf and mute when I'm eating.
You look fat.
You have to learn English step by step.
Tom's better off now than he was before.
Jesus and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for my opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would be even wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is also the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of eternal life, and would long for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
The news has come.
No one really wants us.
They all paid for it.
Be careful.
Alone.
Do not drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom's married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is painting trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a scoundrel.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It really is pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house where Ataturk was born was in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a swimming team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom was jumping up and down.
Tom's dog lay down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
Nope.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message, Mary?
I'll save you a front row seat.
Mary pushes her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What do you conclude?
I prayed for you.
Bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You are average students.
>>bos_Latn<< In childhood, many violent criminals ruthlessly tortured animals.
How long are you gonna be mad and yell at us?
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I love playing music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's gaining weight.
Guilty as charged.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
Some old houses need to be demolished.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very considerate.
When are you going to leave?
This report is not written very well.
She points out that this latest move by the government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It lasted about a year.
How did I miss that?
Could be a trick.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
>>bos_Latn<< One Oslo student who forged his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made the vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself that's the problem, it's all these damning questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend has arrived.
It looks uncomfortable.
What have you both done?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean it up.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I got burned.
Step back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch yourself here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by spraying rocks on your car.
His girlfriend didn't support him.
Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously hurt.
Tom will cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car on my own.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not going into that.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely made the cut.
He's got no equal.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. At the time I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom's not getting away.
I'd go.
Down!
Tom couldn't take it.
Anything you can think of can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the side of guys like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
Please keep this place as clean as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm sympathetic.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
He won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's quiet again.
I failed.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Have some.
Talk about others how you would like them to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
Seems okay to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
Reaction is not always the best course of action.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
>>bos_Latn<< The committee recommends that those who have complained should be reimbursed with a proportional portion of the annual fee with interest.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the file name before attempting to recover deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
I got a lot going on.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
It is not necessary to throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Don't split hairs.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom make a big deal out of it?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know much Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I was very shocked by the news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There is no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to mail this?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't stare.
It looks blue to you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We've all run out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives behind God's feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass the exams?
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
Let's talk in the hall.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
Be careful, it's a very sharp knife.
It's clear.
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing mistake.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that.
We'll miss you very much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will look.
Here's what I think.
I could come with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you defuse the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs have you written?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language. On Tatoeba all languages are equal.
How can we control others when we can’t control ourselves?
Don't rush it.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He dedicated his life to realizing the vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you helped lately?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I overlook this?
What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He repairs electronic devices.
You lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to stand up to this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever uploaded a video to YouTube?
>>bos_Latn<< I was very interested in participating in building a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you right now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her ups and downs on the journey.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I love cable food.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
>>bos_Latn<< The Queen and the King reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
>>bos_Latn<< The flowers are fully instilled.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book the least.
You look good in blue.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why have you been silent all this time?
He took off his clothes.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
You really should take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
Drive slow.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does it happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I've checked in.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Same-sex marriage is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve my congratulations.
Since the note was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you pass the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll study harder.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do it.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Embarrass her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend was not supportive.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
What do you got?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's no trifle.
Control yourselves.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
Several trees fell during a storm in our vicinity.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I quit.
Tom looked angry.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I've filled my glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
This morning, Mary visited the whole village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not at all worried.
It helps.
>>bos_Latn<< Dima slept with 25 men in the course of one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
The costs will soon rise.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you have to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
Winter's over, spring's here.
It's really that simple.
Since these newspapers had written that no farmer wanted to work as a tenant in Westfold, interest grew rapidly.
I'm grounded.
I need to get inside.
We're a little busy here.
All aboard.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
You're standing in my aisle.
It's getting dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask questions of the teacher every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world were not as it is now, I could trust everyone.
>>bos_Latn<< Three of the injured, for whom it is currently unclear what condition they are in, were evacuated to the U.S. Field Hospital.
I prayed for you.
Ethereum and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
You guys all right?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for the day.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, general precautions should be taken to avoid infection in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like big people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car on my own.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips twisted into an ominous smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
>>bos_Latn<< Mary's enthusiasm for the course waned when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous as he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
You're not allowed to smoke here.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I've barely got my eye on it.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took my wig off.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm gonna take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They will know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
What makes you say that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She curled her hair with papillolets.
He was released from military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She makes a mosquito out of an elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He was more a member of the social elite than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me a pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You seem like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year for training.
>>bos_Latn<< The house burned down to the ground before firefighters arrived.
>>bos_Latn<< The months with the most rain are May, June, July, and August.
Do I usually look happy?
I've already written part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the documents.
It has to do with...
It's hard to be passionate, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do it.
Tom will pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their innate talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.
You let me down.
There's snow on this mountain all year round.
I don't think you should rush into anything these few days.
What is eternal in nature, when everything is so fleeting?
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
You got that right.
Everything you have will one day have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to email his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom paused for a moment.
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to take a nap in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
>>bos_Latn<< He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alco-test, before being sent for laboratory testing.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It's been a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom watched closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
>>bos_Latn<< This was refined and embodied in a personality so strange, rigid and stubborn that few dared to work closely with it.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could be there by 2:30.
Merauke is the easternmost city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here a lot as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a ghost story.
Check everyone.
Session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
>>bos_Latn<< Chop the cheese into thin slices or into small cubes.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
I'd like to get started.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused a real stir.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He left a few minutes ago.
I believe you're sincere.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Even though I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I'm supposed to write ten pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm touched.
If I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why not?
"Where do I sit?" "Anywhere."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for a deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How to get rid of a mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It is very likely that FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He wears a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of that.
>>bos_Latn<< Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Is that what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only 5:00 in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
>>bos_Latn<< If there is, a crossover with it will happen eventually.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never got over his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
They all sat down.
>>bos_Latn<< If you have nothing else to do, then the number of the Greek Islands.
She's always wearing tattered clothes.
Will it soon solve the problem?
Mary put a ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do it.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
>>bos_Latn<< The devotees of Vishnu are called Vishnuans; the devotees of Shiva are Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I have completely lost the flow of my thoughts.
I never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak gypsy?
Tom came to see me at noon yesterday.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
"I think completion is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things that people do I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom looked very confused.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
>>bos_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding has to be perfect.
Move over.
We should be studying.
We have no other choice.
When it's like this, it's best to sit at home and not go out.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During the observational power experiment, Tom could not describe any of the pictures on the wall of his living room, although he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
Everyone held their breath.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I love watching you work.
I hope to visit Beijing.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at 1:30.
I'm still a little tired.
>>bos_Latn<< To strive to maximize one's own interest, happiness, or security seems very natural to a human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not nearly as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
That was just the beginning.
Have you finished your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the rings on the tree and found that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems upset.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience with this job.
Can you help us?
Will you get cold?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
>>bos_Latn<< Who cannot be proud to be a Serb, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of chiefs and genocides?
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom will look.
I wonder if anyone could help me. I have a cell phone that just shows an error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was kind of weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
Can we humans digest grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
Chances are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstand me.
That's good.
I'm not gonna push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What have you both done?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and tranquility, are true masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's being careful.
>>bos_Latn<< The white family will arrive in Tokyo at half-past eleven.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write down the steps for you.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Look out!
>>bos_Latn<< Tom failed to produce any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I was just on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a very bad day.
The whole country is talking about it.
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made the omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
I was happy yesterday.
>>bos_Latn<< By the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not a good time.
He's not a kid anymore.
I try to ventilate the futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw the Saudi ambassador resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
>>bos_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came in a little earlier than usual today.
I could eat a horse.
I never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train on his way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snorri Sturluson speak, among other things, of the spread of Christianity in Norway through violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourselves at home!
The students didn’t know how to respond.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gold-plated necklace with hearts is a necklace that will "shake your world".
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining heavily.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're being irrational.
I'm angry.
The dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do it right the first time.
Marie jumped into the river from the window.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary are always walking around holding hands.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
It's been a big help.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look at the size of it!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
For breakfast I always eat fruit and oatmeal.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest checking the water quality once a year in pipes, twice in a well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
>>bos_Latn<< I feel like I've been thrown into a big nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a very long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt you just for a second?
The students didn’t know how to respond.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
Just looking around.
You want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
>>bos_Latn<< Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Maria is the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
>>bos_Latn<< At that point, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
It's perfectly normal.
>>bos_Latn<< A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
I never thought of that.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
He wouldn't like that.
I'm really curious.
Tom double-parked.
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
I didn't see anything.
Are there any other options?
The amount of work done and interest in the invested capital were several million.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't entirely agree with you.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no need to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated about us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours straight.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'm gonna take a shower.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a good presentation for the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's five to two.
I think you should take the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That pisses me off.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish I'd thought of that.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was able to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom comes back safe.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough, but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us were eating hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do it.
Where you from?
I promised.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned to love.
Don't be a loafer.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
>>bos_Latn<< The future looks bleak for Edmond Dantes, having become a victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're being irrational.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
One foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a delight.
He's crazy as hell.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I've sung to you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me the least bit.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks very different from what it was before.
Why are rabbits' ears so big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to handle things on the go.
This one's pretty cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
>>bos_Latn<< Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not doing it!
I'm tired of fighting.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get into trouble.
I just want to get away.
Don't let a chance like this slip through your fingers.
Be careful.
He's in his freshman year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My fluent knowledge of the language is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my, often mutually contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
He's a man of power.
Great!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't arrived yet.
How do we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he didn't want to wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
>>bos_Latn<< Vivaldi wrote many musical works for bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry fractured his right femur in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where there are many grandmothers, there are children.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom looked very confused.
The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
The brakes are squeaky.
Did you make a full recovery?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
>>bos_Latn<< The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the destra side is in New York City.
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
>>bos_Latn<< Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He is a man of words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
That's true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
One should not judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and distributed a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Phase one is complete.
You'll be famous.
He has a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
Take a picture.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It is important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The brakes squeaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a poem he wrote when he was thirteen.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
It was a difficult decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope there will be good weather tomorrow.
Let's sit.
Come and have a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom for a bit.
He's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
>>bos_Latn<< Nothing can be done but to admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
Tom will live.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
I need you to leave a message for Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.

There is no one among you who dares to write your honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would know in advance that it will never appear in the press.

He asked me to help him.
It's hot in here.
Did you make a full recovery?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white T-shirt.
>>bos_Latn<< The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
What's it worth?
I was lucky to survive the accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because it's so crowded.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom's gone.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
Drive slow.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray pussycat, please don't spin.
Just give me a chance.
What makes you smile?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm stunned.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
Remarkable!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I don't think about it.
You are an average student.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you come by sometime?
We've all done it.
What have you done now?
Answer me now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we have homework to do.
It would be nice if you'd wait for me.
They sat in a circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We're just in time.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
It happened.
You need a hobby.
Keep working.
I'm terrible with kids.
We should get another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?
The news came out of the blue.
I have to go now.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm not married to Tom.
It was a little weird.
What does this word mean?
I'm bluffing.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom promises to the Scots of the hills and valleys.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna be here.
It's not related.
Tom used to be afraid of dogs.
Finally we have all the field names in Norwegian and it will be of great help to our users.
Tom will talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left.
Where's the bathroom?
That's not like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our job much easier.
Tom got involved with people who had a very bad influence on him.
Where did I leave the keys?
I got 100 points on my math exam.
Am I in love?
How do you know so much?
I'm expendable.
It's up to you to choose.
The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tom Berners Lee.
Maybe Tom will agree to do it.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
It's not over until it's over.
It's a big day, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep an eye on him.
Be home by 7:30.
That's not all we've got.
Stay right where you are, Tom.
I recommend you visit the British War Museum in London.
For his birthday, he got a cat figurine for good luck from a colleague at work.
I know everything.
Bring the food.
Are you free on Sunday?
That's a fake, isn't it?
Thank you!
I can't just give up.
Do you like it or not?
Life goes on!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I liked that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel important.
Can we just start over?
Do you know what this sentence means?
Looks like he lives in Britain.
Butch-butch is an example of an ideophone.
You pay me well.
Tom said okay.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
Tom opened a new restaurant, but failed to make money from it during the first twelve months.
Tom's right this time.
You lose.
A lot has happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I quit.
What's on your mind?
I gave them an anniversary present.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really that happy?
Am I imagining it?
That's what I figured.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom has written several hundred articles and several books.
Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
There's a good chance we'll win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can only walk about three miles.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a garbage man.
Beer is good.
Don't you ever do this again.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I'm naked.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Don't get scared.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
He's got a big family.
The effects of climate change are much less pronounced in Antarctica than in the northern polar regions.
Tom's blinds are down.
Tom's gonna cry.
Tom wanted to give a very special gift to his girlfriend.
What is the retail price of eggs?
They're broken.
I know you don't want to talk to me.
Can you talk to Tom?
He's got a big family.
You look a little better today.
At least Tom's honest.
We will live like kings.
I didn't write this.
I'm not ready to go.
You have to stay with me.
I'm glad you answered.
>>bos_Latn<< Nine FIFA officials have been arrested and charged with bribery and corruption.
You said you were ready.
They couldn't escape.
Take this with you.
I don't think Tom's ever coming back.
IRS is checking up on me.
I'm early.
Does Tom have any experience?
That's really beautiful.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Food is essential for survival.
These are my best friends.
I made a complete fool of myself.
I've been there before.
I'm mad at Tom.
Can you hand me the remote?
Her name was Maria.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was probably born in Australia.
Tom's stalled.
If you don't understand, you have to say it.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll yell.
Don't cheat.
That's another one!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you to write.
>>bos_Latn<< Mileage depends on road conditions.
Don't fight.
What did you do now?
The sun was shining, and yet it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.
Tom could get lost.
He begged me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
I write awfully.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was formerly a footballer.
I owe you an apology.
I pissed him off.
Tom will go.
Tom spoke in a strong voice.
>>bos_Latn<< The investigation found that, despite his denials, the boss had to know everything about the illegal developments at his company.
We might as well leave.
There's no freebies at Grandma's either.
Tom seemed to be more busy than usual.
Don't push it.
Tom likes to brag.
Let Tom have his fun.
She was a very demanding girl.
Have you fully recovered?
Tom didn't offer to help us.
Tom jumped.
If you don't put some hand cream on it, it'll dry out.
Would you rather have tea?
What is the longest river in the world?
Just stay away from this.
We need your help.
What does this mean in Arabic?
Is Tom sitting here?
>>bos_Latn<< A plastic cup is better than one that is made of real glass.
I laughed.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them an anniversary present.
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
I'll take rice for my collage.
I'm very proud of that.
What did you tell Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of three pre-defined regimens to achieve optimal results.
That's encouraging news.
You shouldn't be going out right now.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Projects like this never end.
I prefer apples to oranges.
Here's a secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let it get to your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
How old is your car?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those of you who may be offended; that was not my intention.
I told you it would work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Criminals should be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom seems a little squeamish.
I shot a bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote myself.
You didn't commit a serious offense.
I don't like to write.
You're asking me questions you already know the answers to.
I didn't see anything.
>>bos_Latn<< Several men get angry at Tom at the bar and Tom tells them he is not afraid to confront them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
>>bos_Latn<< Tom failed to produce any evidence to support his statement.
I'm not that happy.
Anyone want a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
I won't say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I call a taxi?
Tom signed Mary as a payer waiting.
Open it.
Tom is very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
Neither can I.
Do you like roller coasters?
Everything will be fine in the end. If it's not fine, then it's not the end.
Let's move, people.
Are you being sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't make fun of others.
Did you make a full recovery?
I'm proud of that.
Where did I leave my keys?
There is an obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Mind your own business!
She licked the spoon.
What do you got?
We know that's not true.
We're all gonna die.
Tom has two children.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to smile and endure.
Cigarettes cost two marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
This is how it's supposed to be.
Tom got nervous because of you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I have your dictionary?
Tom ate the whole box of chocolates himself.
Can we do this later?
The truth must be told.
Do you like costumes?
Haven't you done enough?
What do you know about me?
I think Tom's very smart.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it in plain words.
Tom only drinks decaf.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
We should get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom sleeps all the time.
I really like your music.
This is Copacabana!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen to my instructions carefully.
Tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom didn't even for a moment think of trying to convince Mary to do it.
Hey, give me a chance.
>>bos_Latn<< There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
Nothing works for me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
My children need me.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it was too little.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom is still frustrated.
If you try, you will succeed.
We have enough seats for everyone.
It was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get lice.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom gone by noon.
Tom looked stunned.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
It won't help if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
I might not sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No. What's the matter?"
That's what both of them like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
The pen I'm writing belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom smothered the smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
>>bos_Latn<< It is an area with lots of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took his wig off.
It just so happens I'm right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Don't go near my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I even tried.
I'm not bitter at all.
Yumi is one of my friends.
He just needed a little time.
I didn't think Tom would do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Mary began to undress.
As above, so below.
Life without love has no meaning.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm firmly against this.
You underestimate me.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes in French.
Police have not ruled out the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
Hard work paid off.
Tom asked me if he should help Mary or not.
I was just thinking about you.
>>bos_Latn<< The signal lights are used to transmit Morse code.
It doesn't go beyond Main Street, but you can catch number 31 from there.
The worst is yet to come.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
A lot of people already hate you.
If I'd known your e-mail address, I'd have texted you.
Tom could beat up anyone.
I'm doing the best I can here.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
The government has fallen.
Tom took a sip of wine.
This is going to take forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I totally disagree with you.
Back off.
Let me do that again.
They live there.
>>bos_Latn<< This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
It had a very different effect than intended.
I was surprised by Tom’s response.
Everybody laughs.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It all stopped.
The book is sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I have no doubt he will succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My paternal grandmother enjoys the tea ceremony.
She smiled.
They fooled everyone.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must show their ID, registration papers and license at the time of inspection.
Tom looks like a little girl.
Do we have one of those?
How do you put that together?
We don't get along well with our neighbors.
Do you like to write?
They decided to get married.
What's Tom drinking?
Exercising has many benefits.
That's what the scholars are arguing about.
He's trying.
Tom told me his father passed away.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom has a strong German accent.
Tom asked Mary to scratch him on the part of his back that he couldn't reach.
There he is.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
You just stay with me.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
Does Tom have a key?
Tom's getting ready.
Always work.
In chess, there are situations in which it is worthwhile to sacrifice a figure to gain an advantage in the long run.
>>bos_Latn<< Young children should learn to empathize with animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom put down his drink.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
Space is empty.
Tom decided against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't have done this without your help.
Don't answer that.
If you would do that for me, it would be very helpful.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried now.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm totally broke.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a minute?
Don't let it get to your head.
My right arm is numb.
That's enough!
I sell coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water and didn't take his clothes off.
I'm a little crazy.
I'd be happy to.
Each bird flies its own flock.
Do you want to see a total solar eclipse that will leave Svalbard in the dark on March 20, 2015?
I sleep tight.
Did you eat something?
Emma was very conspicuous at the party.
What did you just write in your notebook?
I know it's illegal.
I studied hard when I was in school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.
Do you live there?
I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom was all alone.
The cavalry has arrived.
Everyone's asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
>>bos_Latn<< Al lived in the Soviet Union, that great and multi-ethnic one, in the great Tver region, in size equal to several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What have you done to me?
Don't jump!
>>bos_Latn<< When he was six years old he learned to type on a typewriter, and told the teacher that he should not learn to write by hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I did a good job.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't plan this for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was visibly shaken.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really that happy?
Tom never had to do that.
>>bos_Latn<< You don't often hear that someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what both of them like.
Something's come up.
Police, police, help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom will miss me very much.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this mess.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
>>bos_Latn<< The government fell after a vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Are we going to see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have many friends.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
I'm stunned.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan.
You've taken my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to go camping with us next weekend?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Drive safe.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People tell me things.
Cheers!
Tom's in his pajamas.
Did Tom believe your story?
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's that going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom is also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give anything to make sure that didn't happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
They're all standing.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
A piece of shit can never be gilded so it doesn't smell.
Don't rush it.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my ears red?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
>>bos_Latn<< Employees may be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and chances of advancement.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get your driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Is everything settled now?
>>bos_Latn<< How can it be that mathematics, which is after all only the product of human thought independent of experience, is so astonishingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Tom seems to be an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He risked it.
His wife patched up his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
>>bos_Latn<< To change the red meat, I cooked the turkey breasts in mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always grumpy.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I have always loved horror films.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've gained weight.
They're not mine.
I'm doubling the prices.
Could you do that?
>>bos_Latn<< A video recording of the interview was made and was published throughout the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his sorrow, after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we take a break?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do that either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why not?
Tom let out a muffled sigh.
There's a lot of work I have to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
It's almost half past three.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Zurich is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get carried away.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a tough job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I'm feeling worse."
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories live on.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Which is easier?
Did you do the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that spilled a glass.
He doesn't like us.
It would have saved us time if we'd climbed down Park Street.
A police officer arrested him for drunk driving.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
That gave Tom an idea.
I got lucky.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
>>bos_Latn<< Run over any obstacle with this monster of a truck!
Mary spends a lot of time on her phone, texting and e-mailing friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Luck was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children all their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
As fast as it is, it's short.
Come sit next to me.
I found him a book.
I could barely hide my indignation at her insolence.
Butter is made from milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's getting better.
You want to see something specific?
I miss her.
I passed the exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please, don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We will visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the guts to do what he wanted to do.
His comment is easily misunderstood.
Are we meeting tonight?
