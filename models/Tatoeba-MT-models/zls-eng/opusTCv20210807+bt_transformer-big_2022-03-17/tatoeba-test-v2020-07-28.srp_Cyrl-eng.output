Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill you all?
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
Somehow we survived.

Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.

Are we ready to go?
Why not?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is as tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was just whipped cream on a cake.
Pick one.
He got what he wanted.

Give me an example.
What day is tomorrow?
Can you give an example?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom drinks like a smock.
Is that what you want?
That's not like you.
I see, but cannot see.
We are close friends.
Tom was completely drunk.

>>srp_Cyrl<< It was snowing.
How can I say that in your language?

Why are you acting like this?
He's not missing anything.
We live in an atomic age.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mary earns her living sewing.
Where will Tom sleep?
Did you get enough sleep last night?
That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.

This is Brian Rock.
Two men ran out of the room.
It is never too late to learn.
We have to find them first.
Tom was very scared.
It's snowing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You can't blame everything on Tom.
Tom looked very different after the haircut.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm studying now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste your words.
Did you do it on purpose?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don’t have to be smart to be successful.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
>>srp_Cyrl<< We ran out of the building.
I'm a rookie.
This tea is good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
It all happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I tried to be kind.
Don't come in!
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's blown.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't say a word!
I know as much as you do.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I can resist anything, except temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You're under oath.
I wish I'd known.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Caroline is sad, because she can't get pregnant.
I took my wig off.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He is known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom travelled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'll go.
What's all the fuss about?
I don't understand why they're such good friends.
This is a book.
The bedroom is upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you going to do today?
Taxis are expensive.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
I'd like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bird on the roof is a crow.
How to call a taxi?
You didn't answer the question.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
I can ski.
What makes you say that?
It's snowing today.
My head hurts today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think Tom got the fat end of it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'll do my homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The office door is yellow.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
I have a lot of friends.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
Is it yours?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The house is made of brick.
They're all lying.
I took the first step.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Can you help us?
Stay calm.
One day it will be mine.
I've had enough!
That was terrible.
I won't let you do it.
How was your French class?
Stay positive.
I pissed him off.
Is breakfast included in the price?
Is everything okay between us?
What can I say?
Her name was unknown.
Where's my room?
In our wide world, there are an uncountable number of lifestyles, languages and cultures.
We have a serious problem.
It's none of our business.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That's all your wisdom!
I know I'm not perfect.
I'm thirsty.
Don't stir the cashews!
>>srp_Cyrl<< We haven't completely lost.
They need each other.
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do you want to know something specific?
I love watching you dance.
Hi, Tom.
I can run.
Closer.
He came at midnight.
Happy New Year!
I didn't understand anything at today's seminar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom cheats on his wife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two negations cancel each other out.
Get out!
Do you want to see something specific?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thomas was furious as a lynx.
Hungry dogs barking in the street.
Tom sells cars.
I didn't understand what he said.
Are you following me?
France is in Western Europe.
Can I come in?
What's your full name?
I get it.
What are you going to do today?
The students are back.
What did you buy?
Is there any proof?
I'll do it with pleasure.
I don't know who they are.
I saw Tom die.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Have fun while you can.
I won't say anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Diversity is the spice of life.
He's here.
We talked about it all night.
They decided to get married.
I get up early.
Don't thank me.
When are you going home?
He's got no equal.
Democracy is the worst form of government, if not all the other forms tried so far are taken into account.
Wait.
I wanted to help you.
Your shoes are here.
What's he doing?
How much time do I have?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The web was invented in 1989 by Tom Berners Lee.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To the whole world - good evening, good day and good morning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind gave way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm coming to save you!
That's his weak spot.
Time has passed.
I come in peace.
Who are you?
Be reasonable.
What's your name?
You're not bad.
Are we wrong?
What does the news say?
Belgrade is the capital of Serbia.
She's a friend of my sister's.
That lie sounds nice, but I'd like to hear the pure truth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom hired a private detective to accompany Mary.
She likes Russian pop.
I told Tom to wait.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He exhaled.
I wouldn't hurt him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Spice is empty.
I don't understand German.
The average living space in America is twice as large as in Japan.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Champagne, please.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The situation was very dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
The conference was not very successful.
Drive carefully.
It should work like this.
Why are you leaving?
Time has no end, it's endless.
Tom only drinks coffee without caffeine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
The document fell into enemy hands.
It's not too late to come to work at four o'clock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You're staring at the TV again instead of doing your homework!
I bought flowers.
What a man you are!
Spread the Esperanto!
His book is red.
Books have their own destiny.
He's running.
No one believes him anymore.
I haven't forgotten him.
Back off.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom often uses that word.
You can't get enough of each other.
That's the absolute truth!
All right.
That's your problem.
It hurts.
Stay calm.
Turn left at the next corner.
How long have you been here?
Let's sit.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
You have a dirty imagination.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop gambling.
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
What would I do without you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's always unhappy.
Have fun while you can.
We're of the same breed.
Whose handwriting is this?
Be yourself.
I'm used to it.
Thank you very much. You should also feel free and ask for help in the future.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Everything will be all right in the end. If it's not all right, then it's not even the end.
Are you done yet?
Let's go to the movies.
Is it yours?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The proposal was wonderful.
They know you.
I can't.
I've been asleep since ten o'clock in the evening.
Hey.
Let's go.
Cows eat grass.
Don't let him get away with this.
That's exactly what happened.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm sorry, the connection is still busy.
What's the matter with you?
What do you have to do?
>>srp_Cyrl<< "You talk too much," he said.
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was bare-chested and barefoot.
I don't know why my head hurts.
Tom is crazy about Maria.
Are you Uyghur?
Don't be mad.
As it came, so it went.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Do you speak Greek?
Fish, please.
Everything has its price.
Did you do it on purpose?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I have no intention of answering any questions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That publishing company is solvent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pick one.
I'm too old for this.
This model can be combined with any color.
Enjoy it while you still can!
I will never find true love.
I burned my tongue.
Are you done?
I want to get married.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was never brave to happen.
Turn right.
I haven't forgotten him.
"Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am."
Better than never.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A ham-free sandwich is not a sandwich.
What have you done to me?
The Golden Key opens everything.
When's your birthday?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The house is built of brick.
My name is Jack.
She has Ukrainian citizenship.
Better by force than by love.
They may need some money.
Tom is awesome.
I went into her room.
All or nothing.
You're an eye balm.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
I tried to be nice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started roaring.
She's usually late.
You're sad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thomas went to his graduation anniversary last week.
Why would Tom want that?
I know.
What do you mean?
Am I asking too much?
He congratulated me on my success.
I'm still awake.
Everyone changes.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Thanks for the email!
Pick one.
You'll be completely safe.
I turned around.
Stay there.
Head or letter?
I wouldn't hurt you.
Are you a student?
I love watching you work.
Oh, my God!
I'm fine.
Do you want to hear the truth about this?
What is your nationality?
Stand by.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
Quietly move.
They were all young once.
Good-bye!
It didn't hurt.
Be yourself.
I feel sorry for Tom.
Don't yell at me.
You must be new here.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was a gallant argument.
How do you do?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many great thinkers who were unknown during their lives became famous after death.
We're talking about the wolf, and the wolf is at the door.
She is a yoga instructor.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I'm okay.
I am not happy with this situation.
I was just thinking about you.
Sleeping on the carpet is great.
Why are you acting like this?
He married her for money.
My parents died.
There are many secrets in life.
Give me the key, and I'll unlock the universe.
Where's your friend?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I hate math.
I'm so excited.
I don't want meat.
Is there anyone in the house?
Everything's ready.
My mother planted flowers in the garden.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Multiply three by five to get fifteen.
I was angry.
How much time do I have left?
Keep trying.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The dream...I tried to explain it to St. Peter, and I did it in German, because I didn't want to be too explicit.
You're sad.
Sure.

Why me?
We barely survived.

What's your Bosnian name?
This is going to take forever.
I bought a book.
Why are you giving it to me now?
That's all for today.
I called him.
Tom opened the door.
He's not honest at all.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why didn't you say so right away?
You're sad.
Everybody lies.
Is he a teacher?
The first step is the hardest.
Stop moving!
How do we know he's innocent?
Have you ever tried it?
The dogs bark.
She came alone.
Where is the museum?
Why is love so complicated?
They are missing a board in their head.
Are we wrong?
You need a hobby.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the next intersection, turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
And you, Brutus?
I often borrow books from Tom.
I don't know what that is.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
The world is unfair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started to yell.
Don't be rude to me!
She drinks like a fish.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom named his hamster Cookie.
He is a man of experience.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is deaf as a cannon.
Your house is big.
I want to get married.
It was love at first sight.
I mean, so I am.
Don't strain yourself!
This is pure escapism.
You're sad.
Welcome back.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Redheads are driving me crazy!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Emma was very conspicuous at the party.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Call security!
What do you believe?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom appropriated the Russian sentence.
Tom shrugged his shoulders.
I'm very impressed.
I should talk to my father about it.
We're the same strain.
You have to stop smoking.
You better shut up!
The baby's asleep.
He's not a kid anymore.
We're almost done.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She freed the bird from the cage.
That's exactly what I was going to say.
You're my luck.
Thank you so much for everything!
He's good.
Did you know that?
Are you ready?
He's my rival in the business.
Now introduce yourself using these Sentences!
My name is not "you"; it is Ricardo.
I hope this never happens again.
Chances are it will rain tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
I remember everything.
It doesn't matter where I am.
The Xenite!
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
Who are you?
No words needed.
I don't understand this word.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As long as a man lives, he hopes.
What's his job?
Tom's selling the car.
I'm sick of your whining.
I'm too old for this.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I've lost my stream of thought.
It's no big deal.
Can I kiss you?
My name is Ricardo. What's your name?
Can you repeat that?
Feels good.
Speak clearly.
I've never seen a red fridge.
I feel sorry for Tom.
That's enough for today.
I don't see the difference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mosquitoes in Minnesota are as big as storks.
I almost forgot my passport.
You're never on time.

Please add me to Facebook.
It's empty.
We go to lunch at 1 o'clock, that is, in 10 minutes.
Give me some milk.
At this stage of world history, in America there is not one such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who would dare to write your honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would know in advance that it would never appear in print. I have been getting my paycheck regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the paper for which I work. Many of you are also

Such a father, such a son.
Anyone can do that?

That was good.
These are very old books.

You don't know me.
It's not that easy.
Happy birthday!

They won.
Tom is missing.

How about you?
It all happened at lightning speed.

My French sucks.
I participated in the contest.
Good to see you again.
She's making him meals.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Either way, you're wrong.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The redheads are driving me crazy!
Man has many desires that he does not really want to be realized, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such one desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it had been fulfilled, man would have become completely sick of infinite life, and would have wanted death.
