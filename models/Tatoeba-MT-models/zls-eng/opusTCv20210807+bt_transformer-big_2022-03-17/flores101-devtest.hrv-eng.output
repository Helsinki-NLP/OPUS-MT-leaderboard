This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but details that fossils usually do not give, e.g. color and three-dimensional layout, are made possible.
. Scientists claim that the upper side of the feathers of this animal was chestnut brown, and the lower side pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed plumage of feathers called rachis, but do have other features of feathers - the I and II order feathers - the researchers concluded that the plumage probably originated later in evolution in relation to that other feature.
According to the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that it was not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or showing off. Researchers argue that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows adult specimens' feathers of color, and not the fluff of pups.
Research has shown that despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern is part of the adult bird's plumage rather than the chick's fluff.

In France, traditionally, high technology is not used when voting: voters are isolated in booths, where a preprinted sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate is inserted into the envelope.
After officials verify a voter's identity, the voter places an envelope in the ballot box and signs onto the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly prescribed by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes in them and that envelopes other than those inserted by properly counted and authorized voters are not added to them.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers with strict supervision count the votes following certain procedures.

In her second, giant slalom race, she finished in tenth place in women's sitting skiing with a combined time of 4:41.30 - 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gy?ngyi Dani.
Four female skiers from the women's group failed to complete the track, and 45 of the 117 female skiers in the Great Slalom failed to make it into the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said "We have arrested five people suspected of raping a female person from Switzerland and found her mobile phone and laptop."

Adekoya has since been court-martialed in Edinburgh on charges of murdering his son.
An indictment and a trial are pending in custody, but there is a possibility that evidence from eyewitnesses will be derogatory as many media have published a photo of her.
This is an established practice everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and the courts have found the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, said: "It seems that journalists are dancing on dangerous wire over the release of photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which handles all criminal proceedings, announced to reporters that it would not make any further comments at least until the indictment was filed.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.

Hunters in a trial hunt to combat the pest would be under the strict supervision of park rangers who would oversee and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, as part of a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Hunting Association Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for conservation and heritage of the park at NPWS, the four shooters selected to perform the first shooting operation received extensive security guidance and underwent training.
Martelly was sworn into the Interim Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday, which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth interim election council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections that were supposed to have been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPods were reported overheating causing six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
"Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which for the company ""is not serious"". "
"The ministry called Apple's postponement of the report 'really regrettable'."

>>bos_Latn<< Of the 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to the proposal for Australia to become a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share the same view and believe Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last ruler.
29% of those polled said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% said Australia should never become a republic.

The FAA argues that the NextGen system would allow aircraft flight routes to be shortened, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport options will be organised, and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley. Also, facilities for vehicle parking and ground level public transport use will not be available.
Due to fear of lack of transportation, the possibility arose that the game would have to move to indoors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species developed within just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes and a newcomer from the genus of finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all possible shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be threaded into a thin wire, which can be twisted and knitted. It can be hammered or rolled into planes.
"It can be very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books called ""painted manuscripts""."
It's called chemical pH. Your indicator could be red cabbage juice.
Rasol changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH abbreviation) in the chemical tested.

In Harappa and Mohenj Dar, each house was equipped with at least one flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the buildings of Minaean cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths in which both men and women mingled in societies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists in space use a telescope because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world. The biggest change was that the invention of the wheel allowed us to transport much easier and faster.

Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, many small cats (including house cats) eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, that is, a special position occupied by an individual cat, so it does not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called herds.
The prides of lions consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
>>bos_Latn<< Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also highly lethal to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, skip a great distance, and pull five times more power than a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the panther genus) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
Rika the tiger is not like a roar with all the voice of a lion, but more like a series of incomprehensible, shouting words.
The ocelots eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals that eat (prey) by smelling where the prey was moving on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with the help of night vision and move very imperceptibly. The ocelots hunt the prey so that it blends in with the environment and then jumps the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (for example, when crossing a mountain or river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs features or adjustments that differ from the previous ones in order to be able to compete for resources.
The original population has not changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Over time, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that they will not be able to call themselves the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
>>bos_Latn<< Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and then take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
Houses and clothes are made from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
>>bos_Latn<< Mosasaur was a major predator in his time so he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set on his palate which means there was no help for anyone who got in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a ragged tongue, and his diet consisted of turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and maybe there was a cannibal.
He would attack anything that would get into the water; not even huge dinosaurs like T. rex would be his equal.
Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and puffs.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, while the rich men enjoyed communal feasts to feast on the outcasts on their side.
Meals of the ancient Romans could not contain ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia over the following centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkeys.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered to be the house of God.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by staging ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids formed towers, the so-called ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of Jewish families took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were counters open to the road. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the tree was extremely expensive.
Norwegian sagas say that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way to the west and named it.

"Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence it said ""The original Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776."" The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote this large document on parchment (293x4 by 241–2 inches), but it is known to have been rolled up for storage shortly after being made.
Thus, it is likely that this record was added simply as a markup.

In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together - society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of society in some way.
Cities-states are forerunners of the state. Civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation, a trace in culture and equal spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we do not recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states first established a weak central government consisting only of congresses by constitutional act Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no state or judicial authority, in implementing all acts relied on competent bodies that often did not cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to nullify tax laws and customs between states.
To amend the Treaty, the unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were most often absent.

Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Since it consists of a cluster of islands, from the point of view of the geographical profession, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago'."
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors, while sailing along the island, wrote down the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of Aboriginal practices in grain production and employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took over the administration of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Agreement, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they were originally created.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues.
>>bos_Latn<< For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the image sensor formats in digital cameras have the same ratio.
It is a bit confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of width and height of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the ratio expressed by prime integers) is therefore 3 : 2.
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are equal to or closest to this aspect ratio.
The rule of the third, which is often violated and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism with a certain retention of order in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main object is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church became the subject of criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity connected European countries with different languages and customs.
The mighty power of Christianity affected everything from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and reducing poverty, and that the financial resources of the church exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to this principle.
>>bos_Latn<< Shortly after the outbreak of armed conflicts, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in multiple international agreements over the last two centuries.
The UK has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the oceans, which has also caused danger for ships of neutral sides.
>>bos_Latn<< Given that there was not too much interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of citizens and peoples were dominated by the pacifist attitude and separation.

Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation sent by Charles Batchelor (the manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different time periods; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period fierce wars took place among the nobles in the struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died fighting for the highest place in the great Xi'an Palace.
The consequences are social and political, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not the ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true for the military because after the revolution, ranks were obtained on the basis of ability, not class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to launch their own revolution.
"Muhammad was very interested in questions beyond the limits of his boring life. The cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the mountain ""Noor"" (light) he visited so that he could think better."
The cave that has survived throughout history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find even if you know for sure that it exists. Once you find yourself in a cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still in existence.
The Pyramid of Keops, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramid buildings built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives of Pharaoh Khufu and his family members.

The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
>>bos_Latn<< The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob swung the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The wartime expenditures of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to settle much of the cost, and interest on bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will form the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars we must understand the context in which order arose.
The era of these events is commonly referred to as the advanced Middle Ages, which is the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 C.E.).
The developed Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which according to convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological stimulus or technological imperative to a strict understanding that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the country-wide road network does not pay off for just a few cars, so new ways of manufacturing have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars leads to more accidents on the roads, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care to treat injuries.
In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerge that are consistent with the physical residence of society, and are therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Costantinopol was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 C.E. to approximately 1100 C.E.
The status deteriorated in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had greater value than that offered by the Byzantine market.
At this time, the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of Gothic style was in the period from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication, styles in the west lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of that era as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons on clothes.
Self-sufficiency in agriculture is the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seed indigenous to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers engaged in self-sufficiency agriculture, which is still true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subcultures often display their own distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the methods most often used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite examples of accidents of children who did not undergo socialization by adults during adulthood, either as a result of neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultivated or wild. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, abandoning a child is a consequence of the parents' refusal to let their child have severe intellectual or psychological impairment.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are presumed to have been raised by animals, and some supposedly lived alone in the wild.
If fully raised by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within body boundaries) that are almost entirely similar to the behaviors of the animal that raised him, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
>>bos_Latn<< While learning on a project should make learning easier and make it more interesting, placing scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method, but rather a support for individuals facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as well as an animated staple that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
>>bos_Latn<< Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to examine, refer to, and explain procedures that may pose too much of a challenge for the student to solve on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for various reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but it does happen.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is required to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should meet all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"When researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships" as new motivational aspects."
The use of video has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to discern whether a particular person is lying by a correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, argues that persons who cannot understand speech due to brain injury can nevertheless accurately assess its sincerity.
He hinted that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: veiled and pronounced.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of pronounced variations.
>>bos_Latn<< Segregation and recombination in each generation shift the variability between the two sources.
In savannah primates with a human-like digestive system, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: less growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most available plant resources were protein from leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal foods ( ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but contain large amounts of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
"Given everything, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved the ""protein intake"" issue in almost the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah."
Interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal period of sleep and going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to come to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you realize that you are shutting down the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which makes you get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is correlated with the amount of tension of her body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can experience enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the center of Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and enlightenment awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the war, differences in systems, procedures and cultures led to hostilities between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be run for truly empowered armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and restructure along the Romanian bridge defences.
However, these plans failed almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Poland and created a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by boat is certainly the most efficient way for a large number of people and a large amount of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time disabling the ability of the enemy to move its people and goods.
One of the most recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport manpower and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
>>bos_Latn<< At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were kept by so-called goats, usually children or adolescents, which is a name for shepherds who keep goats. These livestock methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn cart tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden rails for wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed horses to haul wagons at a higher speed and haul a greater load than would have been possible on slightly more rugged roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually seen that the rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first fully iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (the upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal gait occurs at australopithecines around 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements and we can even be activists to reduce suffering somewhat in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not looking for a solution that is only temporary, we need to find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems are growing due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After Congress adopted the manuscript draft on July 4, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, he was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printery.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon, on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall building.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and he read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today.
Many do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many of the features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
>>bos_Latn<< They have scales and claws on their legs, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs as T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container with drugs or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, look for special first aid instructions related to this poison.
The term beetles is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from well-known bed bugs, insects that have adapted very well to parasitizing humans.
Killer bedbugs and common bedbugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living quarters they live.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or the best interest of their child.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
When adopting, biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by a scientific method. This method is actually a guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to this method, experimentation, or experiments that present tests for the elimination of one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Latin-language Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge about the Greeks waned, the West severed ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not just a response to external cyclic stimuli, have been detected in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of free cycles even if there are no external signs.
>>bos_Latn<< The experiment performed by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They performed two experiments that pointed to DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material and whether the cells of the germinal line are affected.
Only mutations in sex cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and travel to work by car as they pass by those whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport scenario, everyone is somehow connected to the private car-based transport system and supports it.
Science now states that this cumbersome carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges are rare.
Why are traffic systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something much bigger?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
For a better view of traffic flow, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape from enemies more easily and find food and steam more efficiently.
Most insects have this advantage that they can bend their wings backwards along the body.
This allows them a greater number of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can not bend the wings of a dragonfly and waterflower.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced to the contrary - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
>>bos_Latn<< That seems reasonable because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is infused with water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids were built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, who were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest population.
>>bos_Latn<< The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have long known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and dill because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
>>bos_Latn<< Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pen thus became a close companion to a large number of people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer ways of writing, the pen has lost its status and is being used less and less frequently.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, so they don't even need a pointer.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
>>bos_Latn<< A physical bomb operates on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and sharing the core releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to decay when gently pushed or without pushing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the lunar seas area, and thicker in the plateau area.
On the near side, there could be more dark areas because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growing up.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what makes them appear in an environment to do or not to do something.
>>bos_Latn<< Two popular theories of content are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can come to light in the event that the leaders begin to manage former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain ""part of the team.""
This type of leader encounters difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, assigning authority, and calling persons to account.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done so far and do it his way.
The leader of the team is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
>>bos_Latn<< Members of virtual teams often represent a touchpoint to the closest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than classic team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which the local administration may not understand.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
“Invisible team” represents a team of management to which each of the members corresponds. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through a lengthy process of establishing a learning organization again? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After efficient use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, an organization's process that seeks to overcome an obstacle through collaboration can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
>>bos_Latn<< Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data presents physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by research by scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science-fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of the machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves making machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and making schedules, being able to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now widely used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because it is embedded in some computer software applications for home use and video games.
Excursions are a significant part of every class. Often, a teacher would gladly take her students to places for which bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers a solution for virtual tours. Students can view exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual tour sharing is also a great way to think about the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site changes, but old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills. When they start running a blog, students often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience corrects this in most cases.
>>bos_Latn<< Since students are the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins to strive to improve writing in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them". The need to encourage audience interest inspires them to be imaginative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to transfer learning outside of traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively reacting to materials from the Internet, students can define their point of view in the context of other people's writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).""
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Slightly to the south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to pristine natural beauty in the Muskoka region and beyond.
>>bos_Latn<< Because of all these things, Ontario foreigners experience essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited by wildlife.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have connections with France and are famous luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, which had deep roots in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area surrounds the Sahel to the north, or Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
>>bos_Latn<< Women: It is recommended that women on the trip tell that they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
>>bos_Latn<< Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Resolutely refuse men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is not right regardless of cultural differences!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and in the time of the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, to leave it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to him by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least-interesting shopping spots in Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as bakeries, pots, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gomu was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, and especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma need to be explored to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking options in Africa.
A point-to-point (moto taxi) can be used for a tour of Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands."
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it owns an airport, Timbuktu is today an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List of Threatened Sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main venues where Henry Louis Gates stopped while filming a special for PBS, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more admixtures of the Arab than African world.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies to the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, its southern border being the Crocodile River.
The area of the park of 19,500 km2 is divided into 14 different ecozones, and in each of them inhabits a different kind of wildlife.
>>bos_Latn<< It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, it is necessary to pay daily nature conservation fees and tickets.
It might also be useful for someone to buy a map of the joker that allows entrance to certain parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is a major center for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the panorama of Hong Kong is comparable to a shimmering column chart, which is even more noticeable thanks to the sea in the port of Victoria.
For the best overview of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
>>bos_Latn<< The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is densely clustered on the rugged land along the northern coast.
That place was claimed by British colonizers so if you're looking for evidence of colonial past territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans is declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last places of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one third is covered by water-wetlands.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now estimated to house 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave all day from the intercity bus station (via the river), but most, especially those heading east to Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that the intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
>>bos_Latn<< In most districts, small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses run that are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and pleasant way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
The bridge over the Oyapock River connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The height of the free passage under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017 when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community inhabited in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced self-sufficiency agriculture.
The Chaco province was home to other native tribes, such as the Guaycurs and Payagus, who lived from hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
After the Spanish conquerors met the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay was created, previously known as the "Greater Province of India".
The Spanish began a period of colonization lasting three centuries.
Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asuncion in 1537.
The Argentine national team and the players of the half are among the best in the world.

Smaller tournaments and matches are also held in other parts of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for half matches check out the Association Argentina de Polo page.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equal to the British pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, they probably don’t accept credit cards, but they may accept British and American currency; check with the owner in advance to find out about an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and moisture creates a feeling that it is colder than the thermometer shows.
"There are no special ""rain"" or ""dry"" seasons: the amount of rain is mostly the same throughout the year."
Although many animals in the park are used to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park administration, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters to bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters to other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they may seem, buffalo, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept the appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them places.
In addition, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking foods with strong odors, and keep the camping site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
An infamous naval battle took place in the port in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except one British cruise ship, and nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, during a peaceful gathering in the city, the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III took place.
There are many beaches in Auckland. The most popular ones are found in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All beaches are sandy, it is safe to swim on them, and many shade the Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the port of Waitemata, in the affluent districts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches where there is sometimes a crowd with a large number of shops that extend along the coast. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number One". Beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta"."
There are plenty of French wines to try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be better for you.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are timid, you will easily find bottled water.
"The term ""flat white"" coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black coffee is ""espresso"", cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk. "
Hot chocolate is at the level of Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the above causes are rare.
Still, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and stick to safety warnings.
The wasps appear near the beaches and river mouths north of the city in 1770 from October to April.
Sharks exist, but they often attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance takes the load off the passenger’s back because he knows he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized airport transfers or even flight and hotel combination packages.
They may also keep your booking if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents necessary to arrive at your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the festival venue and most consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you will have to come early to take the place.
Note that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you travel in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin because passing through the ice creates a terrible noise that is heard more in certain cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are not required to have a visa (check conditions).
Casinos usually strive to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the facility.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness reduces the ability to judge and all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there’s little friction and you can’t drive like you’re on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard in the short term, enough snow can fall to get stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or carried by wind, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many states, but traffic mostly takes place without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest lure for tourists in Africa and the best experience for numerous visitors.
The term safari in everyday use refers to land travel with the purpose of touring stunning African wildlife, especially in savannas.
>>bos_Latn<< Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
"Pedestrian safari (also called ""walk bushem"", ""mountain safari"" or ""safari on foot") consists of walking that lasts from several hours to several days."
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules due to coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were due to take place.
Tickets for most of the events are expected to cost between 2,500 euros and 130,000 euros, and regular tickets will cost about 7,000 euros.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing. Many hotels will rent you an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if it is at hand.
Make sure that the fabric does not overheat (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough for water to boil for one minute, and in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if in doubt, buy water in closed bottles from reputable companies.
Passengers may encounter pests they are not used to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, transmit poison or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by the use of force are not usually classified as plagues.
Buying in duty-free shops is an opportunity to purchase products free of taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travellers travelling to high-tax countries can save a significant amount of money, especially when buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most demanding driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving along country roads, be alert to everything: steep slopes, narrow passages and sharp bends prevail.
>>bos_Latn<< The prescribed speed limits are visibly lower than in previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile service here is better than on many other sections of the road, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite good and varied in Bavaria, as with the southern neighbors of the Austrians.
Pastries made with fruit dough are common, for example apples that are added to desserts all year round and cherries and plums that are used in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. With popular cakes, a cup of strong coffee often goes well.
If you want small but generous snacks, try what depending on the region they call Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be ""dry"" or ""wet""."
Yogurt is a common ingredient in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But, if used without further supplementation, the term denotes food that was originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, and consists of a number of simply spicy dishes in which the Javan people's favorite flavors of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices predominate.
Steep are the supports for the rider's legs hanging from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but also involve certain safety risks as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his leg is stuck in the stirrup, the horse could pull him if he runs away. To reduce the risk, certain safety measures should be taken.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Ktome, some saddles, and especially English saddles, contain safety frets that allow the strap of the stirrup to be untied from the saddle if the rider pulls it backwards in a fall.
>>bos_Latn<< The Cochamé Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as the South American Yosemite due to the variety of large granite cliffs and cliffs.
From the peaks are breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports with downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve downhill skiing or snowboarding.
"Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as ""ski lovers"" plan their vacations around skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is very old - paintings in caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first club of recreational skiing.
Traveling with a backpack on the back and on skis: it is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is associated with alpine skiing or hiking although it does not usually include them. Hiking usually takes place on steep terrain and requires tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little more distance than by walking, but very rarely you will achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the arranged trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean repeatedly applying for a visa and passing passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without passing passport control.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state individually, which saves time, money and reduces the amount of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiquities. Some tax administrations define antiquities as goods older than 100 years.
There are geographical differences in definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Hand-made products can be called antiques although they were created later than similar mass-produced goods.
Room management is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also important for many people of other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sami people were involved in large-scale breeding of reindeer but lived on fishing, hunting, and the like, and reindeer were mainly used for towing.
Today, many Somiji are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami area, Sopmiji.
"Although the word 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially among non-Romanian peoples, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Roma."
If the country you are travelling to makes the list of countries for which an alert has been issued, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can consult governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often brief, general and overly simplistic in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any phenomenon of dangerous weather with the possibility of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of dangerous weather conditions, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, showers, and cyclones.
>>bos_Latn<< Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are advised to be aware of the possible risk of bad weather occurring in their area as this may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
"If you do an intense search with the keywords ''course for enemy areas'', you will find the address of the local company."
The course generally covers in more detail all the issues discussed here, usually with practical experience.
>>bos_Latn<< The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many lessons related to first aid and sometimes weapons-handling training.
Many books and magazines deal with wilderness survival, but editions that handle war zones are rare.
Travellers planning a gender reassignment operation abroad must bring valid return documents with them.
The willingness to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
>>bos_Latn<< The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Searches at checkpoints also became more drastic in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery are unlikely to go through the scanner without violating privacy and dignity.
>>bos_Latn<< A recoil current is a feedback surge of waves breaking off a shore, often about a ridge or the like.
Due to the underground topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and it is possible to create a fast current to greater depths.
Death mostly occurs when a person gets tired trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim so that you do not get electrocuted again or, depending on your skills and whether someone has spotted you, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning to your culture occurs before the culture shock. The stage of enjoyment is shorter, the shock lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to re-adapt to their native.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits that belong to your culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country needed time to adjust.
People may not expect patience and understanding when returning home.
The sound and light show on the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, the sounds of tourists and merchants are heard. The story of sound and light is similar to a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is in the role of the background and the narrator of the long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases - sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island on which the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of the still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land region is south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge into a plateau, and then rise again and form a 360-mile-long chain of Ellsworth Mountains intersected by the Minnesota glacier.
On the northern part of the Sentinel range are the highest Antarctic mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote places where there is no signal coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to make a phone call outdoors and the satellite has to be in your sights to make the call.
The service is often used in freight forwarding, on recreational vessels, but also on expeditions that have the need for remote data and voice transmission.
The phone provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with those who leave school because it allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a year off can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
"Finland is a great destination for boating. ""The Land of a Thousand Lakes"" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
For the archipelago and the lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough to sail yachts, sailing smaller boats or kayaking offers a completely different experience.
>>bos_Latn<< Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, having one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most known Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days, and at night return to sleep on board.
If you are travelling to the mainland as part of a boat trip, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Brochures of some cruises include Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrible experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
This is not to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and repulsion that many people feel towards some other things.
Understanding how the plane works and what happens during the flight can help some people overcome fear based on unknowns or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver shipments quickly. Often time is of the utmost importance when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but the problem has arisen with other routes and smaller companies.
If cargo were shipped by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes would take days.
The only way to get through this faster is to send things as checked luggage. According to the rules of the air carrier, luggage cannot travel without passengers, and that is where you perform.
It is understood that you will be able to fly first or business class if you allocate a thicker bundle of banknotes for this privilege (or, even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost you up to four times the usual cost of an economy class seat, that is, eleven times as much for a first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know well that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable trip, and therefore set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the population is Romanian but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The Orthodox faith is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna (Izmir) is today a modern, developed and bustling commercial center surrounded by mountains lying around a vast bay.
Wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with classic red tile roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere of the city resembles Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
You can see the nearby island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvok, and there is an unusual octagonal church in it.
In the churchyard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over individual tombs.
It is worth a half-hour walk in an intriguing village.
To the north is the easily accessible romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which has become known to foreigners after a brilliant display of its beauties written down by Lord Byron.
Bus Scotturb 403 regularly drives to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the Great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Altar), a place of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Keep in mind you are visiting the location of a mass grave that has almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still a large number of men and women who survived, as well as those whose loved ones were killed or worked to death there, whether Jews or not.
Treat this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not scold the site with painted or carved graffiti into existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the characters are in Catalan only because it is the same law as the first official language.
Yes, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements on the metro are in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced through the automatic system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
>>bos_Latn<< Parisians are reputed to be rude and arrogant egocentric.
"Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is to behave nicely, that is, to behave like someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-bred). This will significantly facilitate the stay."
The harsh exterior of the Parisians will suddenly disappear if you show some basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, and the most common are beech, spruce and fir trees. The park is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park inhabits a particularly wide range of plant communities thanks to different microclimates, soil types and variations in altitude within the park.
In this area live extremely diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse can be found here, along with many other more common species
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees as well as clothes that cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have headgear for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your headgear, especially in bright colors, a monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each visitor so you may not be comfortable wearing them. The sizes are universal!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar zones of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
Well amb Oli is a favorite simple dish that is especially eaten in summer: it is bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any addition that is at hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns, but also the pronoun ""Sie"" which means ""You"", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
>>bos_Latn<< This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
No doubt makes it easier to read, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a named form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
The letters to pay particular attention to are c and g because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, and carro means car.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar beginner will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know some Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know some Spanish can easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be taught separately.
Pre-modern observatories today are most often outdated and used as museums or educational sites.
Mild pollution in their best days was not a problem as it is today. They are usually found in cities or campuses and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
State-of-the-art research telescopes are huge objects in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Looking at the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where the favorite flower was a plum flower.
In Japan, the first parties the cherry blossoms were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial palace.

Several buses run north to Hebron, a cemetery where biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried according to tradition.
Make sure you drive the bus you want to travel all the way to Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic for rest.
For example, a visit to castles in the Loire or Rhine valley, a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a cruise along the Erie Canal.
>>bos_Latn<< They also establish routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as Jesus’ birthday.
>>bos_Latn<< Many of the traditions characteristic of this feast were adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
As usual, the Easter night is kept in an open place to see the sunrise.
For this tradition, of course, there are Christian theological explanations, but perhaps it is a pre-Christian fertility rite in honor of the coming of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil is often held on Saturday evenings during Easter weekend, and communities begin celebrating Christ's Resurrection at the stroke of midnight.
Most animals originally came to the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals could not reach the island, so the giant turtle became the main ruminant on the Galapagos.
Since man came to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not appear above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the polar light because the sky will more or less constantly be dark.
Since areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese culture of work is considerably more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are worn at the workplace, and co-workers call each other by their last names or position at work.
>>bos_Latn<< Style in the workplace is crucial - the emphasis is on collaborative effort rather than glorification of individuals' achievements.
Workers must often seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without question.
