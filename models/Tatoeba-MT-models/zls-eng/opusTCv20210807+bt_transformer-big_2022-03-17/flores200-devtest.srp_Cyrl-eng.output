>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and president of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association, has warned that the research is still in its infancy.
Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured, noting that these findings have no relevance for people already suffering from type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sarah Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, publicly announced during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden that the committee, having failed to reach Bob Dylan who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, had stopped trying to reach him.
Danius said: “We’re not doing anything right now. I called his closest associate and emailed him, and I got very friendly answers. For now, that’s certainly enough.”
Ringo’s CEO Jamie Siminoff had previously commented on how the company came about when he couldn’t hear the doorbell from his garage shop.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said he made WiFi chimes.

>>srp_Cyrl<< In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on QVC, a TV shopping channel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ring also reached a court agreement with rival security company, ADT Corporation.
Although one experimental vaccine appears to be effective in reducing mortality from Ebola, so far no drug has proven adequate to treat an already existing infection.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A cocktail of antibodies called ZMapp initially promised but official studies showed it was still not as effective at preventing Ebola mortality as expected.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a starting point and compared three other treatments with it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We agree with the USOC statement that in the interest of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, it would be better to continue with significant changes within our organization, rather than come to dessertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could reveal how the misuse of proportion, bravely described by the victims of Larry Nassar, could have remained undiscovered for so long, and accepts all necessary and appropriate changes.
The U.S. Gymnastics team and the U.S. Olympic Committee have the same goal - to make gymnastics, like other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes follow their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils in principle cannot, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown at the top and pale or cartenoid-colored on the undersides.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur's feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of the feather - barbs and barbs - the researchers concluded that the rachis probably arose in later evolutionary development compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation and pointing. The researcher's view is that, although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample suggests that it is the feathers of an adult, and not a cub.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The researchers stated that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual and not the fluff of a bird.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A car bomb that exploded at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

>>srp_Cyrl<< They concluded that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system was prompted by their light and rotation and nothing else.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gloss and rotation are used together to determine Rosby's star number, which refers to the plasma flow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The smaller Rosby's number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

>>srp_Cyrl<< The standard 802.11n operates at both frequencies of 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This will ensure compatibility with older versions - 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11c, if the base station has dual radio stations.
The speeds of the 802.11n standard are noticeably higher than those of its predecessors, with a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 600 Mbit/s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Duval, who is married and the father of two adult children, did not make a strong impression on Miller, who the story concerns.

“We will make an effort to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020 compared to 2005 levels,” Hu said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He did not set a figure for that reduction, saying the amounts would be brought in based on China's economic output.
Hu encouraged developing countries to “avoid the old path of pollution first and cleaning up later.”
He added that “they should not be asked to take on obligations that go beyond their stage of development, responsibilities and abilities.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Iraqi Study Group presented its report today at 12.00 hours GMT.
He warns that it cannot be said with certainty that a certain course of action in Iraq at this point will end the war between factions, increasing violence or increasing chaos.
The report opens with an appeal for open debate and consensus in the United States on policy towards the Middle East.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The report highly criticizes almost all aspects of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and appeals for an immediate change of direction.
The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be launched before the end of this year to secure Iraq’s borders from hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with neighbors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Current Senator and First Lady of Argentina Cristina Fernandes de Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidential election yesterday evening in La Plata, a city that is 50 kilometres (31 miles) away from Buenos Aires.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ms Kirschner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre, the same venue she used in 2005 to start her campaign for the Senate as a member of the Buenos Aires provincial delegation.
The debate was sparked by a controversy over aid costs and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, which some fiscal conservatives have humorously dubbed the Bush Good Deal for New Orleans.
Liberal criticism of the rebuilding effort focused on awarding the rebuilding contracts to Washington's influential "insiders."
More than 4 million people went to Rome to attend the funeral.
>>srp_Cyrl<< So many people were present that it was not possible for everyone to attend the funeral at St Peter's Square.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Since the Federal Government interfered in the desire to take over funding of Mersey Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania, the state government and certain federal MPs have criticized this act as an opening maneuver in federal elections to be called by November.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But Prime Minister John Howard said the act was only carried out to ensure that the hospital facilities were not degraded by the Tasmanian government, giving an additional 45 million AUD.
According to the latest information, sea level readings indicated that a tsunami had been created. Certain tsunami activities were registered near Pago Pago and Niue.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Major damage and injuries were not recorded on Tonga, but there was temporarily no electricity, which reportedly prevented Tongan authorities from receiving a tsunami warning issued by the PTWC (Pacific Time Zone Weather Forecast Center).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fourteen schools in Hawaii located on or near the coast were closed throughout the day on Wednesday, despite all warnings being withdrawn.

>>srp_Cyrl<< The work done is mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written so as to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The effect the team was looking for would be brought about by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By the same principle by which the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects another dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of halos, and is made up of a multitude of tiny particles.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Television reports show white smoke coming out of the power plant.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Local authorities warn residents near the nuclear power plant not to go outside, to turn off air conditioners and not to drink water from the tap.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Authorities speculate that this indicates that containers containing uranium fuel may have ruptured and leak.
Dr. Tony Mol has discovered drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new strain is "extremely problematic and disturbing because of the high mortality rate".
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr. Moll thinks some patients may have contracted it in the hospital, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low - 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected at any given time in South Africa.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Police stated that the body was probably there one day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The first cases of the disease this season were reported in late July.
The disease is present in pigs, and then it is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The outbreak of the disease has led the Government of India to take measures such as deploying pig catchers in heavily affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets and spraying pesticides.
The government has also promised several million doses of the encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare health facilities for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the most historically affected regions this year have been delayed due to a lack of funds and low priority over other diseases.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1956, Slania moved to Sweden, where after three years she began working for the Swedish Post Office and became its chief engraver.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It has produced over 1000 stamps for Sweden and for 28 other countries.
His work is so recognized, quality and thorough, that it ranks him in the ranks of very rare "known names" among philatelists. Individuals specialize exclusively in collecting his work.
His thousandth stamp was the magnificent "Great Works of the Swedish Kings" by David Klocker Erenstrahl in 2000, which is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He has also been involved in engraving bills for a number of countries, and recent copies of his work include portraits of the Prime Minister on the front of new Canadian $5 and $100 bills.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Fire rescue teams eventually put out the fire around 11:35 p.m.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Upon the dam's construction in 1963, seasonal flooding was halted which spread sediment through the river.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sediment was necessary to create sandbars and beaches, which served as habitats for wild plants and animals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This led to the extinction of two species of fish, and two more became endangered, including the humpback maple.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although water levels will rise by only a few feet after the flood, officials hope this will be enough to restore eroded sandbars located downstream.
No tsunami warning was issued, and according to the Jakarta Geophysical Agency, it will not be issued either because the quake did not reach the required 6.5 scale.

>>srp_Cyrl<< The diameters of all entrances to the cave, called "Seven Sisters", range from at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
Infrared images showing differences in temperature day and night indicate that these are the most likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the adjacent surface, while at night they are warmer.
"Their thermal behaviour is not as consistent as in the large caves on Earth, which often retain a fairly constant temperature, but it is clear that this is so given that these are deep holes in the soil," said Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological and Astrogeological Survey team and the University of Northern Arizona at Flagstaff.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters are alone in the booth and put a printed ticket with a marked selected candidate in an envelope.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When officials confirm the voter's identity, he inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs into the ballot box.
The electoral law of France very strictly codified the protocol.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Nintendo president, Satoru Iwata, at the Tokyo Gaming Convention's main presentation on Thursday, presented the design of the joysticks for the new Nintendo Revolution console.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Like a remote control for a TV, this control uses two sensors located next to the user's TV to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving devices in the air.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Giancarlo Fisichella lost control of the car and finished the race shortly after the start.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His club colleague Fernando Alonso was first during most of the race, but finished it just after the pit-stop, and the cause was probably a poorly placed right front wheel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, due to the damage incurred during the collision in numerous duels during the race.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is very sweet and also sings beautifully, he said, according to the transcript of the press conference.
“I was always deeply touched when we practiced this.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 3 minutes after launch, a camera inside the aircraft showed a multitude of pieces of insulation foam separating from the fuel tank.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, it is thought that they did not cause any damage to the shuttle.
NASA shuttle program chief N. Wayne Hale Jr. said the foam had fallen "after a time around which we would be concerned."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Five minutes after the event begins, the wind starts; after one minute, the wind reaches 70 km/h... Then the rain moves, but so strong and so abundant that it hits the skin like a needle; then the city falls from the sky, and people panic and scream and trample over each other.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I lost my sister and her friend, and on the way there were two disabled people in a wheelchair, people jumping over them and pushing them," Armand Versace said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariva nuclear power plant in Nigata Prefecture is operating as usual.
Hokuriku said it had not suffered any damage from the quake and that reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 9,400 homes in the region were reported to have run out of water, while about 100 were left without electricity.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Three more bombs exploded near government buildings over a period of two hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to some reports, eight people were officially killed, and official reports confirm that up to 30 people were injured. The final numbers are still unknown.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both cyanuric acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of pets who died after consuming contaminated pet food.
The two compounds react with each other to form crystals that can block kidney function, researchers from the university said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Researchers have noted that crystals form in cat urine by adding melamine and cyanuric acid.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The composition of these crystals matches that found in the urine of the affected animals, when compared with the infrared spectroscope (FTIR).
>>srp_Cyrl<< I don't know if you realize it or not, but most of the products from Central America came to this country exempt from paying customs duties.
And yet eighty percent of our goods have been taxed through duties in the states of Central America.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It didn't seem to make sense to me; it certainly wasn't fair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All I tell people is that they treat us as we treat them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature made a full-fledged law prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill requires violent video games sold in the state of California to be marked with an "18" sticker, and that their sale to a minor be fined $1,000 per offense.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Public Prosecution Director Kier Starmer, a royal lawyer, made a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Hyun and Price.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hyun has resigned and will be replaced in cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over as Minister of Economy who remains vacant after Davey's departure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hyun and Price were scheduled to appear before the Westminster Misdemeanor Court for February 16.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nicholas Alden, 25 and Zachary Kudebeck, 21st Kudebeck was in the driver's seat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Edgar Vegila sustained hand and jaw injuries, while Christopher Schneider will need reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon braked while it was pointed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider constantly feels pain, is blind in one eye, lacks a part of the skull, and his face was reconstructed with the help of titanium.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Schneider testified via video link from a USAF (United States Air Force) base in his homeland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championship.
Her first was Slalom, where she finished her first race with "It's Not Over". 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In her second race, the Great Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's gray group, with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyongi Dani of Hungary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Four of the sitting category skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 giant slalom skiers failed to make the race rankings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police of Madhya Pradesh found a stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, “We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her cell phone and laptop.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The accused have been named as Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police Superintendent Chanda Shekar Solanki stated that the slugged appeared in court with covered faces.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although three people were in the house when she was hit by a car, none of them were injured.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed as ambulance services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was initially hospitalized at James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was subsequently moved to Adenbrook's Hospital in Cambridge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is in custody where she is awaiting sentencing and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses may be compromised given that her picture was published in many media.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts find posting photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, said: “Journalists appear to be walking a dangerous line if they post pictures of suspects or something else.”
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, which has general jurisdiction over the prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comments until at least the indictment was issued.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to a debate over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Other covered topics reportedly include the future position of Jerusalem, which is a world for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authorities agree that the presence exists for only five years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Archers in action for supplementary pest control were to be under strict ranger supervision, given that the action was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thanks to a partnership between NPWS and a corporation called the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were hired within the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Mick Offlin, Acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The new election commission (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is Martelly's fifth election commission in four years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last month, the presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to propel the country towards new elections.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This commission was Martelli's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sometimes violent protests are caused by not holding elections, some of which have been on the line since 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPod devices were reported, leading to a total of six fires, but also lighter burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-significant.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the report “really regrettable.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT zone).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ronaldo Mendoza shot tourists from his M16 rifle.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Photographers later took the place of an aged lady as she needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot down with a firearm.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Liggins set out in his father's footsteps and began building a career in medicine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
>>srp_Cyrl<< While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if hormones were administered, fetal maturation of the baby’s lungs would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" on Wednesday containing flight records.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: “Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two months. Pretty uniquely like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldast" Rannels commented, "The moon was just as strange as me...maybe more...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard contended during the 2010 federal election campaign, that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of respondents share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints cast doubt on his fitness.
He couldn’t take the painkillers he needed because they were banned from the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, unveiled the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and on Tuesday it was announced.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Comets may have been a source of water that made it to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and allow life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth since ancient times.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cuomo, who is 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said the rumours were "political chatter and nonsense".
It is rumored that he will run for president in 2016.
>>srp_Cyrl<< NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, and to save on millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It uses satellite technology, in contrast to earlier technologies whose basis is ground-based radars, so that air traffic controllers can determine the aircraft's more precise position and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport placed on overhead trains will stand at Wembley, and parking lots and “park and drive” facilities are not available above ground.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian islands of Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved over only two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the settled cactus finch, Geospiza conirost.
Gold can be processed in all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be processed in the form of a thin wire, which can be twisted or twisted. It can be processed with a hammer or rolled in the form of sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate images in books known as "illustrated (illuminated) manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
pH is the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are stripped (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders together and then squeeze them into the ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange feeling and form a kind of wrapper.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet cups in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The remains of the sewer system were found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where in the same society were men and women together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you’re using a satellite.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A satellite in space receives a call and then sends it back down almost immediately.
The rocket sent a satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has allowed us to transport much easier and faster.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Finally, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that each cat performs and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social among cats, and live in large groups known as packs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pack consists of one to three adult males in kinship, compared to as many as thirty females and cubs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Females are usually closely related to each other, making up a large family of sisters and daughters.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb a tree (though not well), swim, skip great distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but is more like a sentence full of cutting, shouting words.
The ocelots love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and if they can birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are far less than he himself.
Scientists think that ocelots track and search for animals that will eat (poultry) by smelling a place on the ground they were on.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision, and also move very silently. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment, and then rushing to their prey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger rival than previously needed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The original population has not changed a bit, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment it becomes less and less like another population,.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Plants make the oxygen that people breathe, and take the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide us with a shade.
We make houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mosaurus was the top predator of his time, and they feared nothing but other mosaurus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His long jaws were laced with more than 70 teeth, sharp as razors, along with an extra set of teeth on his hard palate, meaning nothing that got in his way could escape.
We can not say for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish and other mosasaurus, and maybe even was a cannibal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He also attacked anything that would get into the water; even a huge dinosaur like T-rex wouldn't equal him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some of their own strange or unusual things to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another difference was that while poor people and women would eat their food sitting in chairs, rich people liked to arrange banquets where they would lie on their hips while eating their meals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ancient Roman meals could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered to be the house of that god.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to please the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Once special towers in the form of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the daily life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open stalls overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the tree was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But regardless of his discovery, there were Eskimo tribes already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the map is drawn slightly against the background of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere at the beginning of its creation this large document on parchment (its dimension is 293 4 inches by 241 2 inches) is clunky to store.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Well, most likely the mark was added purely as a markup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the “higher” French. These were the French who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and joined with them instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was dubbed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of Free France had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in collaboration, i.e. society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is associated with the Latin civis, meaning citizen and civitas meaning city or city-state, and this also somehow defines the size of the community.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable expansion.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, so they are often not recognized as true civilizations.
While the war for independence was being fought, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Treaty of Confederation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative in the implementation of all their legal documents.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before members could change, and states took central administration so lightly that their representatives were often absent from the session.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, were the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 World Cup winners.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical depictions.
Taiwan began as early as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilya formos", or beautiful island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1624, a Dutch company from eastern India established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of Aboriginal grain production practice, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which gave Japan sovereignty over Taiwan which it ruled until 1945.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun and Three-Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, the most common photo format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its ratio of width and height was inherited by image sensor formats on digital cameras.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide, and 24 mm high.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ratio is thought to be the dimensions of this format 3:2 (divided by 12 to give the simplest ratio in the form of an integer).
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly equal to this scale.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The rule of thirds that is often abused and often ridiculed is a simple instruction that creates dynamism, while retaining a measure of order in the image.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It states that the most striking place for the main object is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
>>srp_Cyrl<< During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be supervised.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion connected European markets, despite differences in language and customs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With her inexhaustible power, she affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties in the last two centuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because responses to these tactics were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the 1920s, the prevailing views of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After seeing horrors and war atrocities during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In order to take a job at New York's Edison Company, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at a previous job) intended for Thomas Edison.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each period of China or each family that was in power represented a special dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous period of all was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms which lasted sixty years between the Han and Yin dynasties.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During this period there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in a huge palace in Si'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also after the Occupation Revolution, they were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were outside of his ordinary life. He went to think often in a cave that became known as “Hira” on Mount “Nur” (light).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cave itself, which has survived various times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find it, even if someone knows it exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation occurs.
Nothing more can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of a number of large pyramid buildings that pay tribute to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The label "with an arc" looks like a V, and "a string of arc marks" like a stapler or a square that lacks a bottom.
"Up" means you need to start from the top and push the string, while "down" means you start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lifting the strings usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the strings produces a stronger and assertive one.
Feel free to pen your labels, but remember that the printed signs of the strings are present for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to retire to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, and were forced to do so by a mob of women from the market.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats addressed to the king and queen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mob ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At one point a member of the mob waved the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrified queen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The war costs of American imperialism when conquering the Philippines were paid for by the citizens of the Philippines themselves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to settle most of the costs and interest on securities circulated by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of course, the enormous profits resulting from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represented the basic gain of American imperialism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of order.
The era in which these events took place is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The peak of the Middle Ages was preceded by the working Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages period which officially ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperatives to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself goes a way beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
And yet, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mass possession of the car also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures would appear related to that geography, and they, in accordance with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until around 1100.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, carrying gifts, like silk and spices, that were more valuable than those the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, due to slow channels of communication, styles in the west could be at the back of some 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of that time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Consumer agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food only for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic system, that uses conserved seeds, domestic in a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Historically, most farmers engaged in independent farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Subcultures may be particular due to age, ethnicity, class affiliation, location and/or gender of members.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The traits that define the subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Subculture members often appoint their membership through recognizable and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms and jargon.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to refer to some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "brutal" or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of children occurs because parents refuse to accept serious intellectual and physical shortcomings of the child.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The feral children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or having fled.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely resembling the behavior of those animals who cared for them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through a scaffolding system goes a step ahead.
Metacognitive support is not a method of learning, but rather a support for individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of supporter, but so is the little man-sender in Microsoft Office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Virtual props are an integral part of software and need to rethink, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to implement on their own.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it does happen anyway.
We consider the foster care system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, ongoing education, and reliable health care.
Family placement of children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communications.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The unique features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important uses of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "maintained connections" as new motivational aspects when researching audience reactions to websites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is especially claimed that, if you interpret microexpressions accurately, you can spot if a person is lying.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Oliver Sachs in his speech to the President indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He even believes that such abilities in understanding human behavior may also have animals like domestic dogs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation fund.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variations between two funds in each generation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive tract hardly meets the amino acid needs from plant sources it has at its disposal.
Even if this is not done, there can be serious consequences: the growth of depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The plant resources that are easiest to access were proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us hardly digest them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin ( ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in about the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal period of sleep and falling asleep shortly after that (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you into a conscious state without waking you up completely.
If you reset the watch during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which makes a man get up to urinate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the paths of comprehensive love.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Along with kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries being feuded.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It is planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be real, through the conflicts of smaller countries that represent the interests of larger military forces, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba as well as in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern areas of Poland by violating the Peace Agreement in Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements so as to make multilateral
>>srp_Cyrl<< Overseas shipping is convincingly the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large amounts of goods overseas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, and at the same time to prevent the enemy from transporting its people and goods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most notable, recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and weapons across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been as capable of conquering Britain as the rest of Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Goats appear to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or young, similar to the more famous shepherds. These methods of keeping herds are still used today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Roads for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull higher loads than on slightly more uneven roads at the time.
Rail sills were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This became an established practice, but iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagon.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, rails made of full iron were used for the first time.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. People began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their predecessors, the australopithecines did not walk upright as usual.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Perfection in bipedalism has been found in australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem, and extinguish them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing press.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Danlap’s side”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< John Nixon was the first to read this document publicly, on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 read to his troops on July 9 in New York. One copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap documents that are still known to exist are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original that was handwritten is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
It does not have to be immediately obvious that it is an internal poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open package of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
See the sticker to see specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This term comes from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, and these are insects very well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both killer bugs and common bedbugs are species that stay with their parents for a long time, are adapted to life in the bed or home of the host.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known throughout the United States, making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which make up the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have symptoms of MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or the best interest of their child.
These couples may decide to plan the adoption of a baby.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When adopting, biological parents waive their parental rights so that the other couple can be a parent to the child.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method. This method actually manages most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observing also lead scientific research.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's understanding of all scientific questions, including psychology, was respected.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many notable rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Periodic biological rhythms that are not just responses to periodic reversal of external influences have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with the free-running period, even if there are no external signs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells that are affected are reproductive cells.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, and for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the wildlife and wildlife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Field activities include for example: hunting, fishing, photographing, birding, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Every morning people leave small rural places by cars to go to their workplaces, whereby they pass by those whose workplace is located just in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Science now indicates that this high-carbon economy has moved the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has aided human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The flow of traffic is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because the behavior of the driver can not be predicted with 100% certainty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable consistent range; therefore traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be presented roughly mathematically.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To better represent the flow of traffic, connections have been established between three main features: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These relationships help plan, design, and operate facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to be launched into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most insects have the advantage of being able to collect their wings along the body.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This gives them a greater choice of different small places to hide from predators.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The only insects today that cannot bend their wings are dragonflies and water flowers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some people believed that he was right, but many also believed otherwise; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
>>srp_Cyrl<< This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its six-mile width.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the world’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholic.
From ancient times, people were familiar with basic chemical elements such as: gold, silver, copper, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily excavated with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that everything was made up of a mixture of only one or several of four elements. These are earth, water, air and fire.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that they turn into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are also alloys consisting of a small amount of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stoge was a good friend to many people when she appeared.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the pen was pushed to a lower status and less used.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People are now writing messages on a computer screen without ever being near a notifier.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer comes along.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The fission bomb works on such a principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's about like pushing heavy carts up a hill.Recutting the core then releases a certain energy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thinner is under the lunar sea, and thicker under the hills.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Content theories are aimed at finding out what drives people or what they like.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These theories indicate that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured into adults.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These theories study what it is in certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things from their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to stay “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the other end of the spectrum a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the team's success and failure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Virtual team members often function as contact for their immediate physical group.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, since their teams can meet according to different time zones for which the local leadership would have no understanding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
An “invisible team” is a management team that each member reports to. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for applying the concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, an organization’s process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the needs of the customer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge that is shared and organizational learning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the research of cognitive abilities. Therefore, the field of research is narrowed and this makes it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior underpins the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes we have never seen before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This provides us with a lot of data and materials to make simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI draws a strong connotation to science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications, as it is embedded in several home computers and software applications for video games.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Excursions are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places that bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours. Students can watch museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire the beautiful art of sitting in their class.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Visually sharing experiences from a field trip is also a great way to think about an experienced field trip and share experiences with future classes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, every year Bennett School students from North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital, every year the website is remodeled, but old versions are kept online to be able to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing in students. Although students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, audience attendance changes that mostly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins to make an effort to fix the writing to avoid criticism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful in terms of the world around them". The need to foster audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day as well.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through active responsiveness to materials from the internet, students can define their views in the context of other people's texts, as well as to present their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, and possesses a whole host of art galleries and museums depicting Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All this highlights Ontario even more as something that foreigners basically consider Canadian.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or related to France, and are known as beach resorts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely received at Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape from Europe to India.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Women: It is recommended that all travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Be decisive in rejecting men and don’t be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s okay!).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities to buy in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagini, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of dranguli, but all this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2002, the Goma was destroyed in the lava of the Niragongo wolf, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits from outside Goma should be well investigated to understand the state of the fighting that still continues in North Kivu Province.
This city is also the base from which the ascent to Mount Nyiragongo begins, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a point-to-point (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ?500 Congolese francs for a shorter ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation places it in tourist attractions, and there is an airport in it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to the threat of desert sands, Timbuktu was added to the World Heritage List in 1990.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stations during the filming of Wonders of the African World on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the state, since there is more Arabic than African shrew.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main attraction of South African National Parks (JANParks).
>>srp_Cyrl<< As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
You should also consider buying a joker ticket, which allows you to enter certain South African parks or all the national parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong a name and it is a place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The array of buildings that make up Hong Kong’s skyline has been compared to the dazzling tape graph that the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour makes apparent.
To see Hong Kong in the best way, leave the island and head for the coastal area of Kowloon on the opposite side.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely crammed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This place was taken by British colonizers as their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of a colonial past of territory, there’s a good start.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, and stretches 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sundarbans extends over an area of 3850 km2, one-third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Boomtanga, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As long-distance buses are often full, it is advised to purchase the ticket a few days in advance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the district is served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Oyapoc River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge.It spans the Oyapoc River to connect the towns of Oyapoc in Brazil and Saint-Georges del Oyapoc in French Guiana.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, and the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide each.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 meters in size. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it is not open to traffic until March 2017.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bridge is planned to be fully put into use in September 2017, when customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side are expected to be completed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Gurans were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters engaged in self-sustaining agriculture as well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guikuru and the Pajagua, which survived by hunting, collecting, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Divine Province of India", was founded in the 16th century as a result of a meeting of Spanish invaders with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Canjitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and matches here in other parts of the year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For all tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Polo Association of Argentina (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange the money at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although the British currency and the United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency off the island, so exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; in the summer months temperatures over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity combined provide a feeling that it is much colder than the thermometer says.
There are no special "rain" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the park's management, keep at a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Regardless of their tame appearance, bison, North American and European moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep their proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition, know that smells attract bears and other game, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with a strong smell, and keep the camp clean.
Appia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The port was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk, nearly two hundred American and German lives lost.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chief Tupu Tamases Lealophi III.
Since Auckland spreads over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular are those in three areas:
>>srp_Cyrl<< The beaches of North Coast (in the North Port area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe beaches, and on most of them there is a shade that makes trees pohutukave.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tamaki Drive beaches are in the port of Whitemate, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-run beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich range of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer "Number One" is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for the trip.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you’re afraid.
To Australians, coffee is a "white double espresso with milk" side term. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes highly topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but exceptional.
Throughout the year, a multitude of trips to the ridge are organized, and injuries to which lead any of the above reasons on the ridge are rare.
Still, accept the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Quarterly jellyfish appear near the beaches and near the mouth of the rivers from October to April north of the town in 1770. They can sometimes be found outside this time frame.
There are sharks, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim as far away from you as possible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance makes the traveler feel at ease that he will have somewhere to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, though you may be able to book other forms of accommodation through them such as campsites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, provided transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangement.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to consider an offer or they can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. a visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to a travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to come early to secure a camping spot close to the music.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Remember that although the music on the main stages may have stopped, there may be parts of the festival where music is played until late at night.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some festivals have special camping sites for families with young children.
If you’re crossing over the northern Baltic during the winter, check out the hut’s location, since passing through the ice causes pretty terrible noises for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg cover the time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money that visitors spend. Windows and clocks are mostly gone, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to stay in the facility.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served at the expense of the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, gripping is weak and you can’t drive like you’re on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow may fall in a very short time to get stuck.
Visibility can also limit falling or flying snow, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic takes place mostly without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to land trips in which you can see stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to slowly approach cars, so standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "nature walk", "walking safari" or "walking tour") consists of walking, which lasts for a couple of hours or a couple of days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The expected price of most tickets for the events will range from 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, and the price of typical entrants will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps wet clothes to dry. Numerous hotels allow you to rent irons and ironing boards, even if you do not have them in the room.
If the iron is not available to you, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, then you can try to use a hair dryer, if available.
Make sure that the fabric does not become too warm (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, frying).
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are more ways to purify water, with some giving better results than certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, and in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you are worried, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in a closed bottle.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worse case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force do not usually become pests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excises in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a fair amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The road between Point Marion and Fermont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, as it often passes through isolated rural neighborhoods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The published speed limits are noticeably lower than at previous and later sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than otherwise.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Interestingly, however, the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, e.g. at the Pennsylvania Wilds Reservation.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, much like that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fruit buns are common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what depending on the region is called berliner, funkuchen or krafen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of fluid.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In areas in the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in currys; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Given that it covers 17,000 islands from which to choose, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a large range of regional cuisines throughout the state.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But, if used without additional determinants, the term usually denotes food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a host of simple spicy dishes, among which are the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Uzengies are supports for rider's feet hanging from both sides of the saddle.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They provide greater stability to the rider, but may pose a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse, but his leg is stuck in a uzengia, he can be distracted if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, a number of preventive measures can be taken.
>>srp_Cyrl<< First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety barriers that allow the skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled by the rider at the moment of falling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks provide breathtaking views. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the vast potentials of the sides of the mountain.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as “ski bums” plan entire vacations spent skiing in a special location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing has existed as a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Mountaineering with skiing: This activity is also often referred to as rural skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is connected to, but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Imagine a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to travel a little more distance than you would on a hike - but very rarely will you reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on the arranged trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean that you would have to go through a visa application and passport control multiple times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen zone functions much like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without re-passing through passport-checking checkpoints.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply specifically for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products older than 100 years as antiques.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places such as North America compared to Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Products of handicrafts can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cultivation of reindeer is important for the life of Lapps, and culture within trade is also important for many who engage in other professions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, even traditionally, not all Sami were largely devoted to breeding reindeer, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and reindeer were mainly used for towing and carrying cargo.
Today, many Laplanders are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, an area located in the Lapland region.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and erroneous conclusions about Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel recommendations, it may have an impact on your health insurance or travel insurance in the event of cancellation.
You may also want to listen to the advice of the governments of other countries, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The reports are only brief summaries of the political situation in one country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or lead to the loss of human lives.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and consequences of strong weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spills and cyclones.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regional and seasonally hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the area they are in, as it can affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that could be called a war zone would have to undergo professional training beforehand.
If you type “hostile environment course” into an online search, you’re likely to get the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover in much more detail all the issues discussed here, mainly with practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons-handling training.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Passengers planning a sex reassignment operation abroad must be checked to see if they carry valid return documents with them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify which person is gender (X) or documents that have been updated to match the desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is equally different.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Checks at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the era after September 11, 2001.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Preoperative transgender persons should not expect to let them pass through scanners with intact privacy and dignity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cut currents represent a return flow from waves that separate from the beach, often present on a ridge or similar places.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to underwater topology, the return current is concentrated on several deeper parts and a fast current to deep water can be created there.
Most deaths are due to fatigue when trying to swim upstream, which may be unfeasible.
As soon as you step out of the current, swimming back is not as difficult as it otherwise is.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Try aiming for somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you may want to wait to be rescued.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shock on return occurs earlier than culture shock (the shorter the period of the honeymoon phase), lasts longer and may be more serious.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Travellers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their home culture.
On your return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your habits from the homeland culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People may not expect that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A show with sounds and light in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, the sound of tourists and sellers is always heard. The story of sound and light is like a story book.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of the long story.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scenes are shown on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the South Shetland Islands which were discovered in 1819, many nations lay claim and have the most bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is the island of King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Others include Livingston Island and Disepsyn where the flooded caldera of the still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Elsworthy's Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, and then reappear to form a 360-mile chain of Mount Ellsworth, divided by the Minnesota glacier.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the northern part of the Sentinel chain are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In faraway places, without mobile phone signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a phone call, you need to be out in the open and have your satellite in clear view.
This service is often used when traveling by boat, including yacht, as well as for expeditions that have the need for remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is especially popular with those graduating from school, as it allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during the year when it is paused can improve the prospects for progress towards higher education in the country of origin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mostly there is tuition for enrolling in some of these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. “The land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Boat ride is a national party in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is from one to forty).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most different Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, and come back and sleep on board during the night.
If you are going ashore only as part of a boat excursion, you do not need a special visa (since 2009).
The brochures highlight Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes about other things that just a lot of people have.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For some, understanding how the aircraft works, and what happens in flight, can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or the inability to have control of events.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On some routes larger companies have their own aircraft, but for some other routes or for smaller firms it was a problem.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through the baggage faster was to send the luggage as logged in. The airline regulations will not allow them to send the luggage without passengers, where you enter the story.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a fat pile of money for that privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as a normal business economy ticket, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there’s no point in even looking for discounts for business and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra to have the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and therefore charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered as a result of ethnic conflict.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good traffic hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed and bustling shopping center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The village of Haldarsvik offers views of nearby Eisturoy Island, and has an unusual octagonal church.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the gate of the church are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the intriguing village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after the great story of its beauties was recorded by Lord Byron.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Scoturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, in the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place known around the world for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please note that you are visiting the site of mass graves, as well as a place that has almost incalculable importance to a large part of the world’s population.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are still many men and women who have survived staying here, and many more of those whose loved ones have been killed or have been exploited to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do not destroy the site by making marks or carving graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and in fact everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the designations are in Catalan only, since it was established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and in other facilities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regular notifications in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are published automatically in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make your coping much easier.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The unkind behavior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is abundantly forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It has an extremely wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, soils that differ, and varying levels of altitude.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This area is also the habitat of an extremely large number of diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species can be found here, including the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cats and large grouse, but also many more common species
When visiting monasteries, women must have skirts under their knees, as well as cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have provided skirts for women who came unprepared, but if you bring your skirt, especially with bright colors, you will cheat a smile on the face of a monk or nun at the entrance.
As a rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
And you can borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each dress, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, it is a universal size!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil as a whole.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available side dishes such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie", which means the word "You", are always written in capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and an object.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It can also be said to make it easier to read, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine if the verb or attachment was used in the form of a pronoun.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced the way they are written.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The basic letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the accompanying consonant.
Also try to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "karo" means dear, while "karro" means carriage.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly proper grammar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Therefore, reading this grammar letter would help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and to better understand the phrases.
Needless to say, if you speak a Romanian language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, people who speak little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not have to be taught separately.
