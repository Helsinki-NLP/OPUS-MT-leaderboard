Welsh MPs worried they will "look like Muppets"
Some Assembly Members (AM) have been stunned by the suggestion that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become the object of ridicule.
One parliamentary MP from the Labour Party said his group was concerned about the name being "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means goofy, and pwp means goofy.
A parliamentary representative from the Party of Wales (Vel. Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee that is currently preparing the bill to introduce the name change said the following: "Of course the final decision on how the parliamentary deputies will be titled will be up to them."
The 2017 Wales Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that met with broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what the MPs in parliament will be called, the Committee was fond of the name "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Parliamentarians are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way parliament functions, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentary deputies will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The aim of the vote is to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
>>bos_Latn<< The bells of St. Martin's are silent as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The older people I talked to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr Adams said.
“There’s no one or the other today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Today people are coming together in a different way,” he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and “sooner or later it will be found again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace apartment buildings with apartments housing people who would not help the remaining churches in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day will come more quickly when these churches will close completely because the residents who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches."
>>bos_Latn<< Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
>>bos_Latn<< The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that held worship services nearby took ownership of the building.
>>bos_Latn<< St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the helm also leading a boycott of the 125th Street retailers, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since Reverend Johnson's parishioners had planned its rebuilding, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
>>bos_Latn<< The Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing the larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
>>bos_Latn<< Mr Merriweather said St Martin's had not replaced him.
>>bos_Latn<< What has been taking place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom brought lay leaders of the church and others an episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish composed of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "seek to shift costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old man while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
>>bos_Latn<< The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and then rowed with the group to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was excitement about the lobster being caught, but then he realized that he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
“I yelled for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct an investigation and safety for swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style beauty counters and hiring specialized retailers.
As part of the UK’s large entry into the beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow alongside the decline in sales of clothing and home equipment, larger beauty counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetics is one of the ways supermarkets strive to take advantage of the shelf space that was once intended for TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
Representatives of Sainsbury’s said they would double the size of the cosmetic offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands, similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its range of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger buyers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will trial concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and getting back to buying small amounts of food every day at local grocery stores means supermarkets need to make more of an effort to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlet will look more and more like a department store as the supermarket chain seeks to resist affordable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlet stores to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because two years ago it bought both chains, thereby allegedly incentivizing the sale of foodstuffs and making these acquisitions more profitable.
>>bos_Latn<< A previous attempt by supermarkets to refresh their cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of drugstore income in his supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetic divisions to give our customers a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be on hand to give advice to customers.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination to buy cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quits her 11m-pound contract
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones left to “cook with rage” after TV host Holly Willoughby dropped an 11-million-pound contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand has been compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the show Dragon’s Den by Peter Jones to cook with fury by pulling out of the joint profitable business at the last minute to focus on her own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the gold girl on television during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their brand of homewear and fashion accessories to Truly.
This business was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire stunned everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that with the departure of show host This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions in losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and a possible additional delay in starting the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as CEO in March.
The couples spend their vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m a Celebrity ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Difficult negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the newspapers for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
said Trump, mimicking the voice of a news anchor.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North had not noticed the U.S.' "adequate response" to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that the U.S. has not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the rally.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results - stopping test launches of missiles, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining US troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena to enter, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
>>bos_Latn<< Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for using international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not seeking international help, so it’s all a bit problematic,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the Office for National Disasters, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
Given the constant tremor of the ground in Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
>>bos_Latn<< Although shelters in the case of the tsunami were built in Aceh, it is not something that is common in other parts of the coastal line as well.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time travel between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's decaying structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are being held next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battle in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores for a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in a Premier League match against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 score for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left foot before kicking it towards the opposite tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaja Arrizabalagaja who jumped towards it and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn’t think about it too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half time after hitting Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovačić during that game before turning somewhere in the half of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
>>bos_Latn<< Kovačić made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
He then directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot into the net on the opposite stand next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome Videoton to the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state's disaster office said early Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that large numbers of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was fatally stabbed.
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like to be approached by anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived on the scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said that the procedure of informing the victim's next of kin is also underway.
A cab driver living on Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were now told it would take several hours until they could return to their apartments.
>>bos_Latn<< A police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
>>bos_Latn<< A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were located in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police stood within the fenced area and oversaw the apartment block.
All those with any information were asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, referring to minutes 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the midst of a debate on the "end of history"
>>bos_Latn<< His persecution would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban's destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the debate that is currently being held over the removal of the statues it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster should become the subject of debate.
>>bos_Latn<< The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or enforced.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the way of thinking of the 19th century and part of a person's historiography that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single identifiable figure representing one side of that division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honor and commemoration."
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
A man with only the surname "Yuan" has been found dead of a severed artery and covered in blood near a stable at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder was about to vaccinate pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig bit the breeder to death.
The Evening News of Guiyang states that a relative surnamed "Wu" stated, "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, attacks by pigs on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They are just being played.
They're nibbling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains over the next few days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 05:00 Eastern time, Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure is being created over the Pacific and is shifting toward the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture north to southwest of the United States.
>>bos_Latn<< Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy precipitation to occur in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential flooding, mudslides, and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation to be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to go to the desert on foot because of the risk of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local gale-force winds and dust gusts.
>>bos_Latn<< Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation in an amount greater than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less muddy torrents and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
Dispersed tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning before covering the wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah borders on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, early October is expected to be warm with 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political showdown continued, with reporters interrupting the regular program to notify the last-minute reversal that Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was completely sure Kavanaugh was touching her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a glowing testimony that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
Friday's hearing was also likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number cited in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>bos_Latn<< No viewership was immediately available for other networks that carried the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen typically also has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better picture, this is an audience that is similar in number to the one watching the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest viewership with an average of 5.69 million during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood staring down while protesters showered him with insults in front of CNN cameras.
“I stand here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were monitoring live when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote across the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which were demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then several other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview in the same issue with her on the cover continued to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs duties was "total nonsense".
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dytheon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of gunman Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reported WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A US$350,000 bail was requested.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The Police Department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and the area's citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for "persevering and seeking the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
>>bos_Latn<< The 183 cm tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge in which his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
“That’s what we’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash on Mexico City
The ash that ejects the Popocatapetl volcano reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
>>bos_Latn<< The center was followed by multiple rumbles and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash on anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined anti-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists intercepted by riot police began throwing eggs and paint at police officers, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would otherwise be inundated with tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day when police used batons to calm the brawl.
Over the course of several hours, groups advocating independence chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and opposite them, Unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
Tensions in the pro-independence region have not subsided even a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has declared illegal and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence even though turnout was low as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop polling at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent a night on the streets on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations took place, but demonstrators were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a key, albeit narrow, victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year as their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, announced he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after crashing into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after driving into a house in Londonderry on multiple occasions.
>>bos_Latn<< The incident occurred on Thursday at around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow from a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menge's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to concede his only second loss of eighteen games at the head of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team aligned with the Iberian in seconds.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league trailing by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against mortified guests
Holt's team was to lead well before they scored, since their directness in attack caused a whole host of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but was too slow on his way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only widen the ball after slipping to intercept a head-on kick by Craig Halkett towards the goal.
>>bos_Latn<< The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause difficulties for the guests
And this is how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi together who hit mid-goal.
By this point, the Rangers were mostly in control of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the kick.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs got in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow delivered a wide kick from another organized Livingston attack.
>>bos_Latn<< Long passes failed to cross the Livingston goal line, and no two elevens were awarded - after Halkett's clash with substitute player Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
"Great" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC at the Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed expectations on this entry route.
>>bos_Latn<< Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return among the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
"Captain Halkett was a great front-runner and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall take a break throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
>>bos_Latn<< They were far from the standards they set by a good game under Gerrard.
They only opened a hole in the home team once and it is a kind of a call to snap for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles when the leader of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of the president's supporters showed up nearby to see him.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - have raised their voices by condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The confrontational demonstrations reflect the divisiveness caused by a visitor who is celebrated as a hero by some German Turks and attacked by others as an autocrat.
Road collision in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, on a road with heavy traffic in Deptford to the southeast of the city at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after a collision and the getaway of the driver from the crash site on Chiders Street, about a mile from the Saturday crash site.
Police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus traffic was diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
The prison authorities said six police officers were injured in riots at a male prison.
>>bos_Latn<< Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" troops were brought in to suppress riots involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
Police officers were provided assistance on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been hired to resolve an incident in progress at Long Lartin Prison.
>>bos_Latn<< Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend longer behind bars."
The Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison warden had ended up in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to jail to deal with a serious situation where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (possible benefit for arid areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa sweeps through the Desert Southwest with its remaining strength and brings the danger of torrential flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the area from western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
>>bos_Latn<< Rosa is scheduled to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross directly over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm at the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rockies and the Great Basin, there is a 25 to 50 mm chance of precipitation, with possibly isolated totals of up to 100 mm.
For those not at risk of torrential flooding, Rosa could come as a rescue as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these precipitations could be useful because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. map of arid areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” Weather.com reported.
>>bos_Latn<< The hurricane's course first approached the coast along Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm encountered cooler waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
>>bos_Latn<< Therefore, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening by the force of a tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm," Weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass over Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California Peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
At about 04.00 BST on Saturday an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during a night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called in anyone with a video of the incident.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the wrath and malice of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic side during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and decisively and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault when they were teenagers.
>>bos_Latn<< Christine Ford also testified at the hearing on the charge she made.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to endorse Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to endorse one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service," he told rallying supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of getting Republicans out for the midterm elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
>>bos_Latn<< That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
An aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami Continues to Rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them being dragged off by huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves as high as six metres hit the coast, dragging many of them to their deaths and knocking everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately and were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everyone on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived,” he said.
>>bos_Latn<< Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake matched the two-fold strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city located at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are thought to be missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal."
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that personnel and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a plethora of criticism for failing to provide information that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials claim the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard panicking to warn people down the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed ashore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications around Palu to cease, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still needed food and other necessary supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
A tsunami in Indonesia claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision staff from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Palu where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they forwarded the destruction scenes along the way," Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign aid workers have been prevented from coming to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supply and hiring of personnel from other countries can only begin if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster' we can receive international aid, but that's not yet been declared."
When the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami fell on Pal, the friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
>>bos_Latn<< Some among those trapped in Roa Roa's hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my many years in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread through the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu participating in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole US$26,750 from Brink's employee who was charging at an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In a statement, Detective Dennis McCarthy said the car driver was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy doing so, another man "came behind Brink's employee in the race" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses noticed multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "A living being officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live in which he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's creators said it replaced singer Ariana Grande, who had canceled due to "emotional reasons".
>>bos_Latn<< In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in an interview earlier this year about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, that’s us.
It started with Kanya, which means “the one,” in only Ye- it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
>>bos_Latn<< He is one in a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And a former associate of West's, Jay-Z, toyed with versions of his name without a hyphen and with a hyphen and written in capital letters.
Mexico's Amlo vows not to use military against citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square promised to "never use the military against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during a peaceful demonstration in that square on October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
>>bos_Latn<< He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities attract young criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI research,” said AI investor and AI expert Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans regarding artificial intelligence although the U.S. lacks in principle a formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
"A doubling of investment could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will come to the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that beat the best American game player Othello, and later served as a director in Microsoft's research department and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders, it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on artificial intelligence research over recent years.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the United States boost its artificial intelligence efforts.
“I believe that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other state organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve business partners and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than US$100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Greece from opening accession talks with the European Union and NATO.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership while accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
>>bos_Latn<< While the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko joined a referendum on changing the country's name in Strumica on 30 September 2018, paving the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the parliament in Skopje set up a small stage and received chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "positive" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will enter the referendum, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defence of Brighton to score
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and took the win for Manchester City with a score of 2-0.
Aguero made the win insanely easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
>>bos_Latn<< The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the attack.
He broke through three players of Brighton's defence and then made it to the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's space.
He then added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball from the first attempt to Aguero who threw the right pick ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero is having some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that he scored at that point."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting edge in the Premier League clash.
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's court during that game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling towards the tripod.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before slipping into the out.
Manchester City are battling Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to stop the Rockies from advancing
With the Nationals players eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't too much reason to insist on a new start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes for a Sunday win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make the playoffs.
On Friday night, the Rockies won 5-2 over the Nationals at least to secure a place in the wild-card playoffs, but they still hope to win their first title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, we can at least throw in knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would be playing at the highest level I would have witnessed this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly willing to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching space on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-winger from Washington scored 18-7 this season, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds of changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, the president vehemently commented on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's only five weeks until one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones - I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control.
Democrats, he says, have a mission of “resisting and interfering.”
"You've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, evil, crooked and lying."
He referred to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
>>bos_Latn<< No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer takes different opinions into account.
Does not tolerate personal statements
I was not too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the latest in a series of Labour Party MPs who have been told they are not welcome - all because we said what was on our mind.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
On Friday, the announcement of the Labour Party's meeting said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years that I have worked as a local Labour Party MP, Friday Night General Council meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, nowadays many meetings take a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started not long after Jeremy became leader, since the associates I thought we shared similar political opinions began demanding of me a drastic change of opinion and taking positions I would otherwise never agree with - be it national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a torrent of insulting words on social media calling for my impeachment, denying the center's policies and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have been luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is tolerating offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each proposal of mistrust or change of election rules we become an increasingly narrow-minded party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud, and told that everything would be all right then."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, driven by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government that left my school's multi-purpose classroom to decay, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled as to my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is gripping towards Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political gain will deter me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr - Melrose: 38 to 17 undefeated Ayr heads to the top
Two late attempts may have affected the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they have reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated of the ten teams.
After all, the top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Club Melrose said: “All the best to Ayr, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try realized by Frazier Climo brought Ayr into the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was ruled out of the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose a chance to lift the score, and Jason Baggott took advantage of the unrealised attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by eleven before, at halftime, scoring and realising a solo attempt to change the score for Ayr at 17 : 5 before the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, made by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was then a long pause due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott who was carried away on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued the good game with a Stafford McDowall attempt made by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, with Bruce Colvine's unrealized attempt at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to demolish Clima who did not have the ball; from the penalty kick line, MacPherson performed a touchdown behind Ayr in full swing of penetration.
Climo realised, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe received a high kick from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry into the home team's fifth try.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, appears ready to continue working in the service industries after it was revealed that he was appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series, co-starred by his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to be screened, and Kiernan appears to be planning to devote himself to life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though one source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the sea center filled with cranes in La Paz.
There is an ocean-coloured flag on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are plowed with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring him back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favor of Chile during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive - just like the longing for re-floating in the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1st, after a five-year process, those hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, an optimistic expectation of an outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Numerous Bolivians across the country will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor and that little would change if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ruling by the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “wasn’t complex,” said Paz Zirate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may well have set them back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been claimed by the current Bolivian leadership," Zérate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has buried all the goodwill of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
>>bos_Latn<< Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most beloved presidents - had used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to get past the past.”
North Korea says it won't achieve nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during a meeting between the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
He made the comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "letting the imagination run wild" and that U.S. opposition to the declaration of ending the Korean War will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without first taking concrete steps to disarm Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of big headgear is on its way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely cover the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the catwalk presented a line of wacky giant headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats swept Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that attract attention to the runway.
The specimen that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that has quite "taken over" the head of the model.
Other bulky additions included melons decorated with jewelry, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but these additions aren't designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion pieces.
One of the creations resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion expression - happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of approximately 60 cm that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered social media has sent another big creation to the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit who wore it.
The muted orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was an exhibition specimen in the 2019 Jacquesmus' La Riviera summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist of celebrities and celebrities, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories."
John Edward: the language skills that the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and the added weight is given to this by individual and joint successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement the aforementioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot just use English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by the participants of independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent grade for Mandarin, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered just as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives her an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
>>bos_Latn<< In Scotland each school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a variety of choices in independent schools, as well as teaching staff who are expert in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide a learning environment for children to prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
One cannot ignore the fact that in today’s global business world, language knowledge is very important for the future of every country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be viewed as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer language choices, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play in the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
>>bos_Latn<< Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted a tweet that James was unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers preseason consisting of six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't really need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia, channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with numerous rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned rallies Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has yet to cast his vote for a new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as there is a risk that Republicans will lose their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have sparked controversy over sexual abuse allegations. The Senate's affirmative decision has been on hold for a week until the FBI investigation is complete.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain the upper hand for the November election.
So Trump’s campaign headquarters said five rallies scheduled for next week were aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Most in Congress are so important to the president’s plans that they will travel to as many countries as we embark on a tumultuous campaign,” an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from "Ohi and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month. In that state, he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate Republican candidate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in the polls," political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left heart on the field ahead of Sunday's individual skirmishes
After three one-sided sessions, Sunday afternoon's clash of pairs may have been exactly what needed to turn Ryder Cup around.
“The Wheel of Fortune is Turning” is a saying that is especially valid in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Who's got the wheel of fortune now?
“They had a six-point lead, and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead by four points, while there are 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in his back and encouragement by his game paired with Justin Thomas, with whom he scored three out of four points after a full day's play.
>>bos_Latn<< Spieth played killer from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
Fan celebratory cheers grew louder as Spieth and Thomas came two points behind, and it all culminated in a key way in which Spieth came up with a draw.
The putt that won the game by 15 holes was followed by a similar cheering roar in which one can recognize hope and faith that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just have to focus and think about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
>>bos_Latn<< The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a Ryder Cup sensation.
European strange, but irresistible couple has the maximum number of points and can not go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who did not lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari show that they are exactly the players to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris' Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
>>bos_Latn<< Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly nailed Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's game of doubles.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playing field buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they failed to dig themselves.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
>>bos_Latn<< It is fascinating to watch the games of the pairs closely because you can see the interactions of the players in the pair, hear the tips they give and the ones they do not give, as well as study the strategy that can change in an instant.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and enter the final day with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the team of the United States has the necessary combativeness, which some, especially the Stateside, doubted.
Europeans enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a lead of 10:6
Europeans after Saturday's doubles games in the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the US of 10 : 6.
Dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy that eluded her in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs achieving a score of 3 : 1.
The U.S. team showed greater combativeness in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk's team is to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debutant from the European team to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to score four points in a doubles game in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved to be overwhelming in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 victory.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourballs and doubles and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to the doubles game with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
However, not everything worked out for Europeans on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set the ladder high for their American team.
They first defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was four points behind managed to return to individual games, although Furyk's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
>>bos_Latn<< After two days behind, Sunday counterattacks seem to be hard on them.
North Korea says 'no chance' of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill,” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear testing station and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security either.
While Ri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "progressive" approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made a promise to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has conditioned Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons before then.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure through sanctions to forcibly achieve its goal, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is only a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that continuing sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in have held as many as three meetings over the past five months, adding: “If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea and not by the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Minister Rio’s speech was vastly different from that of last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a “man rocket” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea completes denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearization and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until there is complete, final, and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop financing Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him out after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex, which will happen if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these “appropriate measures” relate to the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has allowed all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of the course after giving a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did I only find out about this now, in my last year of college?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Harvard University professor of psychiatry and executive director of the university's health service, Paul Barreira, says the university has decided to introduce the course after students were observed to have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks involves taking a picture of a dorm where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important the sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in all-night learning before exams continues to exist, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against weight gain because lack of sleep affects the brain, inserts it into a state of starvation and provokes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first year of Harvard classes.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1 : 0 : Menga's goal defeated Gerrard's boys
Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menga's shot cut off Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with a Livingston victory with a score of 1:0.
The Ibrox team wanted to achieve their first away victory after a February triumph and a 4:1 score at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now eight points behind in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time, and the Rangers seemed to have run out of inspiration and did not seem to tie the score.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third with only one scoring margin behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for Rangers after line judge Calum Spence suffered a head injury when an item was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks and thus rumbled past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston line-up that took the Hearts measure last week and would have been delighted that his well-designed line-up had stifled any attempt by the opponents.
The Rangers may have more ball in possession, but Livingston scored more with it.
They had a chance to score as early as two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game which opened up space for Scott Pittman to move on to Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed that chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise blow to the back ranks.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that a judge should have awarded him a penalty in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not honor Columbia's request.
Rangers were only able to point two balls to goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's one head kick by Lassan Coulibaly and a tame kick by Ovie Ejarija were not a big problem.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play slowed the game down, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers again missed to take advantage of a deep Jacobs return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his composure and selected Menga for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The substitution almost had an immediate effect as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett took one long shot after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the closing moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide sweep from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for the eleven because he tripped Jacobs, but Thomson looked away this time too.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now follows a page from our Almanac in the show "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ...day of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
A majorstay of science since that time, the Geiger counter has also become a majorstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado in which seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the lead:
Man: “What in God’s name is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
>>bos_Latn<< When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals."
He said, “Look at that, you can hear it.”
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ bad cells
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
Cells are treated to be able to "recognize" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected into the patient
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer receded for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to know how to “recognize” a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and their "learning" how to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the debate on Saturday Night Live and supported Trump, wearing a hat that read “Make America Great Again.”
It didn't go well.
Kanye West booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-up performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap with the caption "Make America Great Again", he went on to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people and they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual abuse claims.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's speech was transmitted to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock was trying to make fun of West by publishing it.
>>bos_Latn<< Also, West complained to the audience that he was being predeceased backstage for the hat he was wearing.
“I was being bullied from behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been bullied!
>>bos_Latn<< They said I sank," according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the bottom?", and said he would put on his Superman cape because it meant they couldn't tell him what to do.
Try it with love."
Variety wrote that his comments had caused public outrage at least twice, and members of the Saturday Night Live show appeared to be embarrassed, while one person told the magazine, "The whole studio went silent."
West was called in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had passed away a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier mineral water, astounded many.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous people in the world: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE MAFIA.”
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West had simply "been himself and it's absolutely wonderful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his “art”) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
>>bos_Latn<< So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "going to be officially known as Kanye West".
>>bos_Latn<< He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, which is also known under the names Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
The 45-year-old man was charged with the attempted murder of a man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
Police reported that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will consider the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has taken on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor lashed out at the macho hero stereotype, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel they have to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones, has admitted he wants to “very decisively” tackle the problem.
"Personally, I feel very determined at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, in relation to the problem we are now seeing?”
>>bos_Latn<< Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these particular traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time, how can we change that?
“Something must have gone wrong for the kids.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming sequels to Game of Thrones after it ended next summer and said he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard's play True West, the story of a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he thought getting to know his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming this series, which gave me my family and future life,” he revealed.
>>bos_Latn<< Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow in the fantasy series that won the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
>>bos_Latn<< Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that people who become infected with HIV in this way are almost absent.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Studies estimate that due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of its efforts to tackle the problem, the Chinese government promised in 2003 free access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public's staff provided information about GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic MP assures that these claims are being spread by individuals of the "ultra-right wing", as well as by websites.
“Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The released data reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
>>bos_Latn<< Information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address revealing the source of the disclosures belongs to the office of MP Waters, as well as information about the MP's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations - is by no means responsible for the leak.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and absolutely false."
>>bos_Latn<< Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something they didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He has to be calm and steady."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom they accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also took to Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had informed "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are detected and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Back on the Job" - not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights against spies
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and this seems to be the case in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel, titled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screens in 2011 with the title "Johnny English Rides Again".
Will the twisted own satire on how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
Incompetent Johnny English with his eyes peeled off and his rubber face again has a license to complicate situations, while his name more than anything tells him that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is of course a wacky secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to "diluted" glamour resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr Bean's character and is somewhat reminiscent of that fellow who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His character is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man whom Atkinson once played in now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
>>bos_Latn<< There are one or two good-looking moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly struck his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" themselves offer elements of comedy.
In my opinion, Johnny English's wacky episodes are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent gags embodied in the character of Mr Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker entered Britain’s most secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the dismay of the acting agent, played by Kevin Eldon.
This has spilled over the prime minister's patience, a haughty and belligerent character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying hard to faithfully portray the character he is supposed to represent to Theresa May, but she hasn't exactly gotten the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard, who is currently employed as the headmaster of a fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few good-looking gags here because English teaches rock-and-roll spying.
The English are quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where they meet again with Bough, a former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova who was embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: disguised as waiters set fire to a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht, and English causing complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headsets to find out what the inside of Volta's house looks like.
Everything has been done properly for this last sequel, but no matter how appealing and ostentatious the film may be, it still contains a lot of childish elements.
Quite a central accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I wondered again, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
Labour denies working four days a week and getting paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which Britons would work four days a week and be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources state that the idea could "fit" into the party's economic program and plans for the country to bow to workers' interests.
The trade union congress supported switching to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times newspaper: "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day workweek will not be achieved overnight, but it represents a tendency that fits into the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to lend its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this aspiration.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power out of the hands of "wicked executives" and "profits" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire stake because the Labour government could make "deductions" based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of private companies' capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court bid for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility the FBI might discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegations were made, and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, is as if carved in stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh and it would really take a strong accusation to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it all decisively," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
>>bos_Latn<< I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission - ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that it has 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way of persuading people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called "clictivism" - where people feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet they are really changing something?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters that sought to achieve a number of different goals.
He argues that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its activities, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the insured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and contractors in the UK that advocates “helping children develop to their full potential”, with a pledge to provide $35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens of the world.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told an audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will provide dietary interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we’ll fail.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
>>bos_Latn<< The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monye belong among some of the performances at this year's event in New York to be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as 'blockade' to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington may, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where it operates at the call of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in this area, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance which presents itself in the US as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, saying they were in fact the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "using the same trick" in fossil-fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as the Trump administration's intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will 'seriously consider' running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the helm,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center, fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent voting for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 run for president are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "general issue" and said of his son and other war veterans "they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have given for this country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with reporting domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who disputes the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys-at-law who supported Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing pervasive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the Immigration Board’s 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be resolved on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court's friend said in a report.
Lawyers further argued that a policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 degree earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulders, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' by 'propaganda ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement of the China Daily in Iowa's top-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a Reuters statement as a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register newspaper, Branstad states that China "now doubles that harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic trajectory as the media is under heavy pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused an offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
With Kavanaugh’s debacle, Republicans distanced voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding the event were very stirred, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to cast their vote.
Such things cannot be brought back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, said of the article published Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) latest insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, "November is coming!", protesting in the Senate hallway as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond expectations,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news agency.
“People say they are already on a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts hinted that there could be a negative reaction if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was put on the reserve bench, it’s also about the way the Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony to be true, while 35 percent said they certainly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the decision about who can access what information is entirely the user's.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Medium post on Saturday that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the decoration of the priests of the First World War with the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honour of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
>>bos_Latn<< However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received Britain's highest military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he received this recognition.
According to a report by the official London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal "through very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
He later rushed to the front lines and, with "incredible courage", led the unit forward before rushing to the Polish cannon without any help and cutting down three of the military detachment.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve, and it inspires humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and they got Piglet Peppu instead.
Imagine this: you stay up all night watching a string of Bellator 206 matches to finally be prevented from following the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main roster, and in the UK it was shown live at night on channel 5.
At six in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in the UK were left in shock when the transmission was interrupted by Piglet Peppa.
Many were not at all impressed after just for the sake of fighting they remained awake until the early morning hours.
One fan described the interruption on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Yup, Peppa Pig."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I consider reruns, I think we can probably sort something out,” Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences circulating that were not friendly at all.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't.
I can promise you next time it won't come to that.
We'll keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority in comparison to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he started high school, he was unaware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as an apostate on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others during his adulthood because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference from others have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.
He says he wanted to prove he was “someone and something” so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent figure advocating for LGBT people and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he thought he was happy to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re so young, you’re going through so much,” he said of his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he breathed, and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally became aware that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for Heather Small 's first song 'Proud ' , which echoed in him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which he is always chilling at .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to completely regain form to avoid an awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who plays a record-breaking twelfth time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and quadruplets.
>>bos_Latn<< Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and devising his game on the practice field in hopes of correcting what was troubling him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National pitch, where a long uneven pitch routinely punishes imprecise kicks.
And if the terrain itself is not scary enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week, in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
>>bos_Latn<< Furyk said he had confidence in his man - more than that and could not say.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to joke around with people, and he’s a great guy for that,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where captain Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their win with a tight margin of 141–2 131–2.
“You are constantly reminding us that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow margin,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win by a score of 5 - 3 on Friday and yesterday lead by a score of 10 - 6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play at full strength.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing is over until the billboards are advertised.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who stands opposite us - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted by his players' performance on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of a ball in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the big day, and that’s completely different.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re there as an individual, your golfer abilities are ultimately tested.
That’s the message that you have to pass on to the players, and that is that tomorrow they have to give their best.
Now leave your teammate because he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those major turning points on the final day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players before the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start, like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When this rush goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our lineup and placed the boys as if we were, you know, going to try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to attempt a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the top half.
I decided that this group of guys goes in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship put on hold
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military spokesman.
>>bos_Latn<< The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrisome problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period, where it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years without returning to the home ports.
However, constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - said to allow Germany to show power abroad - will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unlucky F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
>>bos_Latn<< This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would make the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically overweight which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
>>bos_Latn<< The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (US$3.6 billion), compared to an initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of ships capable of deployment".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as old ships were put out of commission and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Foundation eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Endowment for Scotland (NTS) will follow common and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile screenings using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's voting and what kind it does.
A habitat map and report will then be made to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
>>bos_Latn<< Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
>>bos_Latn<< They are threatened by construction and landscaping work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flytraps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on the trajectory of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
>>bos_Latn<< There are ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species inhabit Scotland live.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal area for them.
“Here at Threeve we have a huge space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress."
It stresses the importance of checking for the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for the Scottish Bats Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population is progressing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese-Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after reporting the charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good guy" who was let down by the "one percent".
>>bos_Latn<< The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to overturn the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer transferred to Italian giant Juve as part of a 100 million euro move.
Brexit: UK will ‘forever regret’ losing carmakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production delays at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal over the possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more supplies in its Derbyshire factory than needed in a single day, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
“We have to come to an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful series of supply chains.”
At Toyota, they could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs go away, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as fighting continues over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus threaten Mueller’s independence has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
>>bos_Latn<< Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be delayed by another week taking into account everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a consequence of the TV reporters' aversion to "theatrical behavior," though she said, "I'm not going to stand up to the fact that they flaunt themselves."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more questions-answer meetings than any president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We analyzed the figures.”
Short speeches will continue to happen, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States a question, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and you've seen that in the last few weeks, and it's precisely that you can talk to the president of the United States that will replace brief speeches to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
Health minister writes to EU workers at National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over Brexit fears
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the cost of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31–27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He got to the playground line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
>>bos_Latn<< Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further searches.
A representative from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that he has "no details about the type/scope of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing time, plays his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five tackles before exiting the game, thus reaching a total of 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Under the Conservatives' new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s bid to attract young voters.
The tax increase will be imposed on non-taxpayers in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be charged by individuals and non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts to fight homelessness.
The additional fee - which is added to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago to other homes and properties bought for rent - can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital city - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused major construction firms of maintaining high property prices by taking but not taking advantage of the land, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable real estate to fix the "disgrace over the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced the proposal of a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unprovoked evictions.
>>bos_Latn<< He also wants to give councils more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream - that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable Britons.
The dream of owning a home has become too far for many people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to one day become Scotland's governor.
Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the Major League, three points short of the leading.
>>bos_Latn<< This summer he moved to Stadium of Lights after leading St. Mirren to the Scottish Football Championship again last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always drew me back.
But that opportunity could only come true if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors in the post of Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no fear because he inherits such famous names at such a large club, having previously declined calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could take the club there again.”
Ross is only finishing the third year of his management career, after a period during which he was assistant chief at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from dropping into the third category and led St. Mirren from the brink of dropping to the next season's title winners.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled taking over Alloe.
“I really believed it was more about managing than playing.
It sounds strange because I managed well, earned a solid income and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
>>bos_Latn<< I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but managing it seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to research
The summer heat wave increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw revenue increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the Business Advisory Office of the Chief Business Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of good weather and the participation of England in the World Cup which lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mainly served made much higher gains on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where mostly food is served have also suffered from the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, liquor sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales declined by three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s rest and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the biggest factors when it comes to selling on the outside market.

One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" sites
The news has increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "master" account that they show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, open secret accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts  - a reference to a photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they used a cleaned "main" account to show off to their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who was inciting other words: “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Headmistress (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teens are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of an athlete' at Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual governing body assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of the athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic golds, and is now a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischemic seizure could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he completely recovered, he learned to walk again today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement.”
Opinions on the Internet about an advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertising that compares nursing mothers to cows that have stirred up opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be "the world's first silent wearable traitor", consumer technology firm Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to the music of "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not a udder, these are my breasts."
Then there is the refrain: "Pump, pump, I feed the baby with it, pump, pump, I husband your ladies."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that they steal their children a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Traitor Elvie discreetly fits into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
The second person comments: “Understandingly traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitorous mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, “It’s a totally crappy commercial.”
Others defended the commercial, with one woman admitting that her song was "ridiculous".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Giving away milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I got it the way it is.
It’s a great product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at moms who issue milk (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
>>bos_Latn<< This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they have all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who issue milk say that they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even get out during the betrayal.
Ana Ballarin, Mother’s partner and executive creative director, commented: “Traitor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to put betrayal and all its challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new betrayer will bring.
This isn't the first time the traitor Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on a runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had signed up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr Albenze said.
According to shelter workers, with the aim of speeding up proceedings for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard previously.
Many will appear through a videoconference call, rather than in person, to bring their case to the immigration court for legal status.
Those who fail to meet the criteria for help will be quickly deported.
According to statements from shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
>>bos_Latn<< Advocates have said that these concerns are expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is highly likely that signs that a child is being tortured will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause the trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
>>bos_Latn<< The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for Syria's reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive Russian-backed attack by Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members soon to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to a revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr Trump should win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
>>bos_Latn<< There are currently no signs of viewer fatigue.
As of 2014, prime-time ratings more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about the secretary of government who becomes president after the Capitol bombing.
Nell Scovell, comedy author and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Because it makes me laugh,” said Mrs. Scovell.
In chaos there is entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of abortion laws stemming from Roe v. Wade’s trial, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet you surpass the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of “deep backgrounds” for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (“a garment full of brashness,” writes the Washington Post), and the implications of these intimate descriptions.
I, for example, Super Maria will never see the same eyes again.
“Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawnshop, about the rotating cast and day-to-day plots of the Trump show.

He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside is pouring into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a reshuffle of congressional districts resulting in two candidates running for the same seat.
>>bos_Latn<< This recently reshuffled district of suburban Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb ? who won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps greatly with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally tailored in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign finance fight between major party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely followed special March election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
>>bos_Latn<< Political analysts gave a slight advantage to the Democrats.
Should El Salvador be punished for supporting China?
>>bos_Latn<< Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, narcotics control, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include reduced financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
History
Next in line could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly arranged with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If a majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps ultimately with a jury of his peers.
There are many such “ifs” and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable - nor those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler, only for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or delayed.
Americans now face several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year that he had secretly suggested filming the president and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the FBI's recently commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
>>bos_Latn<< If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a swastika cross.
With a legacy like that, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic about facing Rapida from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapida from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in a season to a 2x2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game believing we could do something and we scored a point.
We may have been able to steal the match in the end, but, generally speaking, the draw is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can’t sleep because they’re worried about retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study respondents said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that will help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth.
Arrange your legal documents: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Hire health care representatives to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Give details in a written plan to be ready.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications cut off, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the province of Donggale, an area north of Palu that is closer to the quake's 7.5 magnitude epicenter.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal regions of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reporting domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by an Alaska state trooper.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty "of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could be in prison for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
>>bos_Latn<< His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcohol-related condition.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed

Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to attack a bike path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed down pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in New York’s southern district.
Both of these points lead to the eventual death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of Saipa's struck a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov had carried it out as "despicable, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnumer," the statement read.
>>bos_Latn<< Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's Southern District last prosecuted the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City, in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty to life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics ? since one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a motorcade in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "come out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is being highlighted by Tories inclined to remain, who join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain her Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the reaction and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bone said at a Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to “reject Chequers”.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out the Chequers."
Addressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain completely inaccurate."
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, addressing reporters with the words: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
>>bos_Latn<< Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must make themselves "feel the pressure" if they are going to let down the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us people and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘it won’t work’.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remainder marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Crowds of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for the smooth state of the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“This is all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to 'seriously consider' running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at an immediate gathering with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been at the center of speculation for some time now that it might be up against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
>>bos_Latn<< Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that implies a woman at the helm."
Arrest for the murder of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
>>bos_Latn<< On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday at 247sports.
Wayde interfered to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a weapon and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimetre-high third-year student growing up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in 10 first-team games last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title after order secures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a major role in the race".
>>bos_Latn<< From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to enter the trade at the back, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered boxing one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the free interior in danger of falling behind after a double move in the defense of the third corner.
>>bos_Latn<< Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran much of the race as he relied on his tire to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve a formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and nasty and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at leaks and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you released the information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public - ‘ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we release ... No, we didn't," he added imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t make her story public,” Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which is what she was looking for.”
However, her denial was not met with the approval of the president, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: “Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the meanness, the disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5x3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
>>bos_Latn<< The Dundee Stars made amends for defeating the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning in Dundee on Saturday by a score of 5 - 3.
The Giants came to a two-goal advantage in the early minutes with kicks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the homers to a tie, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe team, who came from behind and beat Dundee by a score of 2 - 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams' season, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game came in the fourth minute, more precisely at 3:35, with Kendall McFaul's assist, with David Rutherford assisting to double the lead by hitting Beauvilliers four minutes later.
In the rushing opening game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to an equaliser in power play with a goal at 27:37.
>>bos_Latn<< Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to Dundee's first lead late in the second third, and he made sure of the win when his team was already halfway through the final third of the game for the fifth time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, host teams from Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Plane Passengers Avoid Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he was killed while ensuring the safe take-off of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower which was rocking strongly.
He stayed behind to ensure the safe take-off of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
He then jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise, as many bodies are still in ruins and many could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
Waves reaching up to six metres in height have ravaged Pala, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
>>bos_Latn<< Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles bring in bodies every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and said: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not trace one of the passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
>>bos_Latn<< Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to make their way through the water that stretched to their waists to the exit in the event of the plane sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
>>bos_Latn<< The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to repair the pier also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 feet of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades, but that none of them were involved with Air Niugini.
Analyst reveals timeline of night in which woman was burned alive
Prosecutors on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a U.S. Department of Justice analyst, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the whereabouts of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was reportedly with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
>>bos_Latn<< Sanford testified on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from the phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based singing group The High Breed claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and a reference to social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, comparing the charge to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when, upon her arrival on her first day of work in 2016, she learned that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEE ANOTHER BLACK GIRL,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an “inconvenient” situation, and fired Ms. Maurice, for what she claimed was that their then-ex-nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job poorly, and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Maurice now sues the couple for dismissal compensation and seeks $350 per day in damages for the six months period for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do these things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple countered claims that they were racist, saying that ending Maurice's employment was reasonable, over fears that she would not be trusted later on due to the insult.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in that situation.
"That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with the talking teddy bear, a new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is going to read the book for the first time.
>>bos_Latn<< It's very entertaining what we now know about Paddington's tremendous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before the teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a braggart,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt like an achievement of your own: you’re proud of him even though none of it is really your doing.
>>bos_Latn<< I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit solely to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it was really bad and to believe he wouldn’t get away with it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be joining you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding and then everything went out.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all inside.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I put my head down, and the tears flowed down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a great sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
>>bos_Latn<< Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy."
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have a negative impact.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards “so people know there’s someone you can go and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom of it - when the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eyes or want anything else."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
>>bos_Latn<< But we will go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought maybe we could bring a little unity if we could really get something like what he wanted - a limited investigation in both time and scope," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" amid a entrenched party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is driven by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term election comes in just five weeks, November 6th - if, as is expected, Republicans do not fare well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break with the deciding vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'declining' under Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and higher tariffs that traffickers charge people.
>>bos_Latn<< Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
>>bos_Latn<< The vast majority of defectors from the North eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected DMZ zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South - which are still technically at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for failing to make any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is out of the question that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated smear" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work, as he showed he was prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by making such statements and by the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed down.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only capable of being on the Supreme Court, he’s also not capable of being in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or an abortion bill stemming from Roe v. Wade proceedings, as she was considered a conservative judge.
>>bos_Latn<< In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether to overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticisms, anger that has accumulated for months and years - all this can not be got rid of without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be an executive and who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but developed the technique that when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she’s talking to says the following: ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'"
And then she continued.
>>bos_Latn<< And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was how, on one occasion when I was crying out in unspeakable rage, an elderly woman - a cold manager I was always a little afraid of - dragged me to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
>>bos_Latn<< They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair aboard Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign had already moved on, she fell behind on fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of the supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, only gave her $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she was saying she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so consumed with emotion ? gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism ? that her throat was squeezing.
“You’d think I’d had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled of the media’s reaction to her.
“You’d think Kleenex would be my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what they would put on my tombstone.
“She was crying.”
How a trade war between the U.S. and China could be good for Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war has resounded loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (150 billion pounds) worth of products, in fact taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, and recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on 60 billion U.S. dollars of goods.
China has promised to strike back at the U.S., and the world’s second largest economy will surely not give up anytime soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse to begin in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a strategic think tank that focused on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding a country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water on the first kick, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and has become one of four players ever to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player on the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with a career-high 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop the tears.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have won the cup again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He relays the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, by a score of 2&1 in Sunday's individual games.
“I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm said.
>>bos_Latn<< Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
>>bos_Latn<< The unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
