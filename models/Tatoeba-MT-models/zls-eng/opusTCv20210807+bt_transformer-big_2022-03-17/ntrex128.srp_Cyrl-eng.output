Welsh Assembly Members Concerned About ‘Similarity with Muppets’
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some Members of Parliament (AM) were overruled by a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
>>srp_Cyrl<< This came about because the name of the assembly is planned to change to the Welsh Parliament.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of the assembly of all political affiliations worry that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
One member of parliament from the Labour Party said his party was concerned that the abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
>>srp_Cyrl<< For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means wacky, and pwp means feces.
A member of the assembly from the political party Plaid said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A Welsh member of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to changing the name, but noted that MWP is pronounced similar to Muppets.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently working on a draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When it came to the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission opted for the option Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the broadest support in public consultations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Assembly members are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could give the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Reform laws will also include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules for disqualification of members of the assembly and a board system plan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of the assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate over the said bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the country's new name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province under the name Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of a neighboring northern state represents its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have died down, and the churches of Harlem are fighting for survival.
“The old people I talked to say that there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There’s no one else today.”
He understands the disappearance of the bar.
“People are hanging out in a different way today,” he says.
“Coffees no longer have the role of living in neighborhoods where people regularly go.”
Concerning churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be back to square one.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries from the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will accelerate the closure of these churches because most of those people who move into these housing facilities are unlikely to become their members."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both churches were built by communities composed of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The original white Methodist community moved away in the 1930s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The black community that performed worship nearby took ownership of the building.
>>srp_Cyrl<< St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street merchants, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The fire of 1939 caused great damage to the building, but since Father Johnson's parishioners decided to rebuild it, they commissioned an organ.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the organ “the organ of the poor.”
The expert who played the organ in July called them something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that they were the first organ in the world played by some black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr. Meriveder stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< What has taken place in St. Martin's over the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have brought world leaders to the church, and others to the episcopal diocese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The parish administration - the governing body of the parish, composed of world leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs" to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in hiring architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some parishioners complained about the intransparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old During Lobster Hunt in California
>>srp_Cyrl<< The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived in search of lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he overheard the boy's calls for help, and then along with the group he rowed to him to get him out of the water.
Hamel said he first thought it was just a rush to catch lobster, but then “he realized he was yelling ‘She bit me!
She bit me."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of the assembly of all political affiliations worry that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘A shark is in the water!’” added Hamel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is not known what species of shark attacked him.
Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a statement that a few weeks earlier the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it was determined not to belong to the dangerous species.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic upper hull injuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Officials closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in the town of Encinitas.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sainsbury's shopping chain plans to enter the UK beauty market
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sainsbury's becomes a competitor to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with departmental department store-style cosmetics staffed by expert assistants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As part of a significant breakthrough into the UK cosmetics market turnover of 2.8 billion pounds, with that figure rising as sales in fashion and home equipment markets decline, larger cosmetic products departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will open in more stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetics comes as supermarkets find ways to use the shelf space after lawsuits over TVs, microwaves, and home furnishings.
The Sainsbury’s retail chain has announced that it will double its range of beauty products to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The existing product range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The supermarket is also relaunching the Boutique Makeup Palette to make most of the products suitable for vegans - as demand is on the rise when it comes to younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test retail outlets at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to daily small-scale food purchases at local stores means supermarkets have to make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's retail chain, stated that the department's outlet will increasingly resemble self-services as the supermarket chain tries to hit back at sales facilities with large discounts to Aldi and Lidl with multiple services and non-food products.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sainsbury's retail chain has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and a number of Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which it says has increased food product sales and procurement profitability.
The previous attempt of this supermarket to modernize the departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended in disrepute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots Store in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after taking a win in the revenue sharing of pharmaceutical products stores in its supermarkets.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The new strategy takes effect after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company three years ago with 281 stores to the company Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lloyds was said to have a role in this plan by presenting an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty departments to provide a better environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an indispensable destination for beauty products that sets new standards for how to buy.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of 11-million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of the series "Dragons Den", "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the business worth 11 million with his personal brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
>>srp_Cyrl<< Willoughby does not have time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The company of this couple collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, star of the series Dragons Den, by pulling out of a last-minute lucrative deal with their brand to focus on her own new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones was “outraged” when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of new offers worth up to 1.5 million pounds, there was no longer enough time to devote to their brand of home and accessories Truly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The company cooperated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and was projected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of 11 million pounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When Willoughby, 37, announced via the social network Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones went from Britain to one of her cottages.
In the words of the source: “Holly put the Truly brand at the top of her priority list.
It was going to be her long-term plan to make money from over the next few decades.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Her decision to withdraw stunned everyone involved.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The warehouse at headquarters in Marlow is packed with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the program "This Morning", one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household equipment, as well as possible further postponements of the launch date.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Willoughby, who is the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Willoughby founded Truly with Kapow in 2016, and was joined in March by Jones, 52, as the company's CEO.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After the tough words, "sympathies arose"
He drew criticism in the media for comments that some said were “not worthy of a president” and for a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump pulling out so much?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“We are not withdrawing from anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “appropriate reaction” by the United States to the initial North Korean disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States is not lifting the sanctions that it is constantly putting pressure on.
Trump made a much more optimistic point of view in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests were completed, the hostages were released and the remaining US troops returned home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He defended this unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake ravage the island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so we are facing some difficulties,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign staff can work in the field.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pal to determine whether international agencies will be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that are shaking Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they can rarely be found on other shores.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The loss of life was also probably contributed by the apparent non-advertising of a tsunami warning siren in Palu even though the warning was in effect.
Travel between numerous Indonesian islands and otherwise presents a challenge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A hospital ship that was stationed on Lombok Island to indicate aid to earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the site of a new accident.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure and spared no money for roads and railroads.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, a lack of funding hit Mr Yoko's administration, and he is due to be re-elected the following year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr. Yoko also faces pressure creating long-lasting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
See: Daniel Starage, Liverpool player, manages to score an even point against Chelsea
>>srp_Cyrl<< Daniel Starage saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday by a shot in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Staridge received a pass from Gjerdan Shaqiri at 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He first moved the ball to the left, then kicked towards the farthest part of the net.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ball went high above the goal in the direction of the right upper corner of the net.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She eventually flew over goalkeeper Kep Arizabalaga who jumped to catch her and stormed the net.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was just trying to set myself up and set myself up for a kick, and players like Shaqiri are always playing forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible," Staridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I touched one ball and just kicked it, without much thought.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chelsea led 1-0 at half time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Azar in the 25th minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Blues striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovačić on the fifth, then turned in the middle of the field and ran to half of Liverpool.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kovačić exchanged several short shots in the middle of the field.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then directed a brilliant center shot, leading Azara to the goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hazard overtook the defence and directed the final left-footed shot into the furthest part of the net alongside Alison Becker, a Liverpool player.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Liverpool play against Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.

Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
>>srp_Cyrl<< The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to a disaster management agency statement on Sunday morning.
There have been numerous reports of people trapped in the rubble of buildings struck by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves as high as 6 meters, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, has been buried by the remains of collapsed buildings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police arrested the man, 32, on suspicion of murder after the woman was stabbed to death
>>srp_Cyrl<< A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Berkenhead, Merseyside County.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Muse on John Street, and the 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police called people in the area who had seen or heard anything to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would call anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
>>srp_Cyrl<< A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Berkenhead and was found on the property.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This afternoon friends who think they know this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The investigation is ongoing, and police have stated that they are currently informing the victim's next of kin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that everyone was barred from entering and leaving the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Residents were told they would only be allowed back in a few hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was rumoured that a police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< At 2 p.m. two police vans were in the cordon with another van in front.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several police officers stood in the cordon overseeing apartment blocks.
All who have some information are invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and provide the record of 247 as of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate about the monuments due to the contention of "falsifying history"
>>srp_Cyrl<< Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-style destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts conducted by his fanatical Puritan followers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was an inevitable goal in the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cromwell neither issued an order nor conducted iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the part of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Turniccroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure which, according to many, still deserves to be magnified.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to have defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case of course, monarchy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The reliability of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this mid-17th-century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell as an individual is a recognisable figure representing one side of that divide.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His successes as a holder of the title of Lord Protector also deserve to be magnified and kept from oblivion."
Killer Pig Injures Chinese Farmer
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to local media reports a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Juan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The owner of the pig farm is preparing to inject injections with pigs in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He reportedly came with a relative from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His cousin found him dead the next morning and noticed that the door of the neighboring pigpen was open.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said there was a large male pig in the pigsty that had blood on its mouth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 250-pound pig caused mortal injuries to the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said a relative referred to by the surname Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so it wouldn't attack anyone else, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, there are already recorded cases of attacks by pigs on humans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting critical injuries on the man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig had kept a Welsh peasant pinned to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer from the province of Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a “trigger” for them.
“They’re just playing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They like to nibble, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You just need to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Rosa will bring in showers in the coming days north of Maxique and southwest of the United States that will lead to flooding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 137 km/h, on Saturday morning at 5 am Eastern Time, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of the settlement of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward, toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push high tropical moisture northward, to the southwest of the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to certain parts of Mexico on Monday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low pressure field approaching will lead to widespread showers in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential flooding, spreading debris with water and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will intermittently cause rainfall of about 5 to 8 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Possible torrential floods with a sharp deterioration of the conditions due to the unbridled nature of tropical rains.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It would be extremely reckless to walk into the desert while threatening tropical rains.
Due to heavy rainfall, the canyons can turn into frenzied rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to violent winds and dust in the air.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The low pressure field approaching will bring locally heavy rain to certain parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation amounts of over 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause minor wear and tear of the debris and slippery tracks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It will be the first rain in the region for their rainy season.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Local tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday evening and Tuesday rainfall will cover the wider area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The showers will spread to the area of southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico on Tuesday and will take until Wednesday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In October, large oscillations in temperature are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, while in tropical regions, rather warm weather will remain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature at small distances.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A great example are the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees.
The long-term summer heat will grow and expand again in the next few days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The temperature in New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels on Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with television companies ending the regular programming scheme for Friday due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake according to which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure a drunk Kavanaugh was touching her and trying to undress her at a high school party.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh, in poignant testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
That was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She tallied average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The figures were not immediately available for other networks showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In doing so, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of viewers in the offices.
By comparison, that number of viewers can be matched by the audience following the football game of the playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, with Opinion hosts who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, recorded the highest viewership of any network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake was the central personality of the drama that took place on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After giving a statement from the office of a moderate Republican that they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CCTV television stations CNN and CBS recorded protesters yelling at him as he tried to connect with the elevator for a hearing of the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He stood for several minutes looking down as they insulted him, which CNN carried live.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and so many women are helpless.’”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All cable and television outlets carried live events for hours later when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate's decision making.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Flake said he only agrees to it on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which was persistently demanded by a minority of Democrats.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake was partly convinced by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After talking to Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election had weight because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing politics' in Brexit case
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conservative Party conference on September 29, 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, previous foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Brexit plan, calling the proposal for a single customs zone for Britain and the EU "completely meaningless".
Wade Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspected Dytheon Simpson for University of Louisiana Player's Death
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of gunman Wade Sims, a 20-year-old University of Louisiana basketball player.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Daitheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police found glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB channel attached to the CBS network.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After questioning Simpson, police stated that he admitted to fatally wounding Wade with a gun shot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was given a $350,000 bail, the lawyer said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The office of the parish's pathologist in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday citing a gunshot wound through the head to the neck as the cause of death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Credit for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest is attributed to the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Capture Task Force, the State Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents.
University of Louisiana athletics director Joe Alewa thanked local law enforcement for “preaching and pursuing justice.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simms was 20 years old.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two-foot-high winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last zone scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ashes ejected by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This center has recorded more mild seismological activities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Images on social networks could be seen of thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in the municipalities of Mexico City, such as Hotchimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after independence supporters clashed with riot police, as thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on secession split by the population.
A group of masked separatists, who were restrained by the intervention police, egged them and threw paint into the powder, and dark clouds of dust were created in the streets that are usually teeming with tourists.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Later in the day, there was also a brawl that police officers restrained with pendreks.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" as they faced Protestant Unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fourteen people received help due to minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions in the pro-independence region have not eased even a year after the October 1 referendum, which separatist Catalans celebrate even though Madrid has declared illegal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was small since the crowd of people against the secession boycotted the election.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, leading to violent clashes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independence-minded groups camped out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police force.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we had one of the brightest moments.
>>srp_Cyrl<< My parents were crying with happiness that they could vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation," he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to continue in the same vein this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and prosecuting the vote.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest on the phone in support of the police, said the conflict was being fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, has announced he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Running for European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after slamming car into house
The three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonery.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 Ballynagar Crescent Street British Summer Time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings stated that the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the house.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Menge's shot brings Livingstone a 1-0 win over Rangers
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dolly Menga secured the victory with the first goal for Livingston
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingstone, upon moving to the senior league, surprised Rangers by forcing Steven Gerard to concede only a second defeat in 18 games as the club's manager from Ibrox Stadium.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dolly Manga brought changes with his goal as Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian elsewhere.
Gerard's team remains without a win in the Premier League this season, and next week he meets with the leaders on the table of the Harts, who are eight points behind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Before that, Rangers come Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, Livingston extended the unbeaten streak in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not yet suffering a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed his chances against uninspired guests
>>srp_Cyrl<< Holt's team should have led long before the shot he scored, since with the offensive game he was making trouble for Rangers at all levels.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scott Robinson broke through, but carried the ball in front of the goal, to be kicked by Alan Lithgow past the net after he stepped in to receive a kick by Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hosts gladly let Rangers players play in front of them, knowing they could give the visiting team difficulties with the actions played.
That's how they scored the key goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers made the offense, and Livingston opened the game after performing a free kick by having Declan Gallagher and Robinson combine to hire Menga who passed the ball into goal from the middle of the sixteenth.
In the previous part of the game, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but could not break through the host defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the same style, it continued into the second half, although Kelly had to defend one stroke of Alfred Morelos.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Alan McGregor, Rangers goaltender, deflected Scott Pittman's attack and Lithgow kicked past the goal in Livingston's second-inning action.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingstone defended several centrists, and two sought-after penalty kicks were rejected - after Halkett's objection to replacing Glenn Middleton and one to playing with his hand.
"Phenomenal Game" Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
>>srp_Cyrl<< Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All players, without exception, were outstanding and again exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Since their return to the front row they have hardly changed the style of the game and the people, but great credit should be given to Holt for the way he has brought vitality to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Captain Halkett was unsurpassed in leading top organized defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warral on standby all along.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Rangers was not inspired.
As good as he used to be under Gerard, he fell well below that level.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They couldn't score - they only broke the host defense once - and it's a sort of alarm bell for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met with a mixed reception in Kolonja
The meeting between the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They disagreed on issues involving human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Erdogan then headed to Kolonj to open a huge new mosque.
This city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters found themselves near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - have also been heard to denounce Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Controversial protests reflect a divided opinion of a visitor who some Turks in Germany have branded a hero and others accuse of being an autocrat.
Road accident in Depford: Cyclist killed in collision with car
>>srp_Cyrl<< In a collision with a car in London, a cyclist was killed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 UK summer time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The driver of the car stopped and paramedics showed him help, but a man was killed on the spot.
A few months before the crash, another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash, which the driver struck and fled.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six prison policemen were injured in a riot in a men's prison with a high level of security, the prison facility said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The riots still ongoing occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British summer time.
A team of "Tornado" specialists was brought in to overcome the unrest, which was reduced to one wing and in which eight prisoners participated.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police officers were shown assistance at the scene due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Especially trained prison officers have been brought in for the ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear our view that responsible persons will be reported to the police, which is why they could be held behind bars for longer."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Her Majesty's Prison Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the state.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In June, it was announced that the prison warden was undergoing hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In October last year intervention police were called to jail for serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential flooding (which can come well in drought-affected areas)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert to the southwest, carrying with it the risks of torrential flooding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and her approach will announce rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hurricane Katrina (1967) struck a region 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm, with amounts of up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert to the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5-5 cm, with possible total amounts in isolated places up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential flooding, the rains that Rosa will bring can be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious cause for concern, rain will be welcome in some parts because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the U.S. drought surveillance agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected at least by extreme drought, a second-order category," reports weather.com.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa, which still had hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind gusts of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico and moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it has lost power.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Therefore, landslides in Mexico are expected to occur when the storm reaches tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible that brings a significant flood risk.
“Total rainfall of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora State, with as much as 10 cm possible,” weather.com reports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and reach southern Utah on Tuesday late into the night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rain in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. desert to the southwest," the National Hurricane Monitoring Center said in a statement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This rain is expected to lead to torrential flooding life-threatening and raging water in deserts and landslides on hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
>>srp_Cyrl<< After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 British summer time.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were arrested during the night, the Avon and Somerset Police Service said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police have asked anyone who possibly has footage of this event on mobile phones to contact her.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the mischief and fury” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the merciless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the mischief and fury” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh denied in an energetic and emotional testimony before Congress on Thursday the claims of Christine Blaise Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At this hearing, Ford also testified about her claims.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have seen all of Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage."
"A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-rate biography in the public service," he told rallying supporters in West Virginia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump concluded that the Democrats were on a mission of “providing resistance and interference.”
The Senate floor's first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a senior GOP aide.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami leave hundreds dead, and numbers are still rising
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 384 people were killed, with many being swept away by giant waves that washed up on beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a large earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hundreds of people gathered in the town of Palu for a beach festival on Friday when at dawn waves six feet high hit the coast, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything that came their way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The tsunami was accompanied by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of immediately escaping and therefore becoming victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, said in a statement to the Jakarta media.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some people climbed trees to avoid a tsunami and so survived, he stated.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
The aerial photos released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges skewed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Subsequent tremors struck the coastal city again on Saturday.
In the area where 2.4 million people live, a series of earthquakes was felt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy of the devastating earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is possible that the geographic features of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a greater tsunami strength," he said.
Nugroho said the damage had been “huge” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nugroho stated that greater losses and damage were possible along the coast 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were completely cut off and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," the statement said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The agency received criticism from various sides on Saturday that it had not issued a notice that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at a time when a warning was issued.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In an amateur video shared via social networks, a man on the top floor of the building is heard shouting from the stains, warning people on the street on a tsunami approaching.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Within minutes the water wall had hit the shore, taking buildings and cars away.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the footage.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake and tsunami led to a power outage that caused communications around Palu to cease, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but that the evacuated people were still in need of food and other basic supplies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The city's airport has been reopened only for assistance arriving and will remain closed until October.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
The staff of the humanitarian organization World Vision arrived safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the employees hide in shelters made of waterproof canvas placed in the yard of the office and on their way to the city were greeted by scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Even when aid groups began taking the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Palu.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Indonesian regulations, an influx of overseas funds, supplies and people is only possible if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be characterized as a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national catastrophe, we can provide international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that struck it on Friday, friends and family of the missing still harbored the hope that their loved ones would miraculously escape the sad fates of the victims of natural disasters.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rescuers released a woman under the rubble who was trapped next to her mother's body for two days on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr. Gendon told how, hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel crash reached the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were attending a beach festival.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, his messages carried only one grey mark, instead of two blue ones.
"I don't think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 during ATM charging at Newport on the Levee
>>srp_Cyrl<< The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's company employee who was charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and was preparing to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “ran behind a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of cash he was supposed to put into an ATM.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Everyone who has information about their identities is invited to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to 'Ye'
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rapper Kanye West changed his name - to "Ye".
Announcing the change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: “It’ll be known as Kanye West sometime.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which came out in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live", in which he is expected to announce a new album "Yandhi".
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am all of us, that’s us.
From the name Kanya, which means ‘one’, I have gone to just ‘Ye’ (you) - which is the personification of everything good, bad and unclear in us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This album is, essentially, a reflection of who we are."
He is just one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, who is known by the nicknames Puff Daddy, Pee Diddy or Diddy, pointed out this year that he would like to be called "Love" and "Brother Love" (Brother Love).
>>srp_Cyrl<< A former West associate, JAY-Z, used the nickname with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians in the face of the country’s 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador made a promise in a square in Tlatelolco that he would "never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people".
>>srp_Cyrl<< On October 2, 1968, troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were based in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving financial aid to those studying each month and opening more free state universities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said unemployment and the inability to acquire education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These comments came after various foreign U.S. governments announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“For starters, it would be a good idea to double the budget for AI research, as all other countries are making so much money for the United States, and we are looking for new progress in this domain,” Lee said.
Duplicating the funds could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Super-Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is working as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the U.S. Defense Department’s “Robot Challenge” of New Technology Development Agency (DARPA) and asked when the next one will take place, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Lee said.
“It’s not the academic leaders going to China, it’s the big corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years employed prominent minds from universities to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lee points out that changes to immigration policies could help the U.S. strengthen its aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In July 2017, the Chinese State Council outlined a plan to develop a new generation of artificial intelligence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The China National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will include partners from the sector and the academy, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation.”
On the other hand, the National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked their bids for European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern state represents its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would threaten the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot reads: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that was created by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The state election commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went to vote for my children because we belong in Europe," said Ljoše Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev voted in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zorica and son Duška, in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country that should pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and sets up chairs in front of the tent set up by opponents of the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upright heads, not through the service entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be ‘yes’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result "for" would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would vote, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, concluded that 57 percent of voters would vote in the referendum.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For a referendum to succeed, it takes half of the registered voters plus one to go to the vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it seized power in May last year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes entire Brighton defence and scores goal
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defence on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England by taking a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seemed too easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Argentine striker received the addition in the middle of the field from where he started the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He ran between three Brighton defensive players, so he mowed everything in a row in the open field.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then Aguer was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He outplayed one defense player, so overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The English winger immediately returned the ball to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by kicking into the right side of the net with his right pick.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point."
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the initial advantage to the Skyblues in meeting the Premier League was brought by Sterling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He scored in the 29th minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Aguero received the ball in that action deep in Brighton territory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He directed a beautiful addition to Leroy Seine by the left flank.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sein had several contacts with the ball before employing Sterling on another easel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sky Blue striker threw the ball into the net, to then immediately slip outside the boundaries of the field.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Manchester City meet Hoffenheim on Tuesday afternoon in a Champions League group game at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scherzer wants to play against Rocky a game with no competitive significance to the Nationals
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs competition, there was not much reason to insist on another game.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the competitive-minded Scherzer hopes to take position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in play-off play.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Rockies secured themselves a "wild-card" spot on Friday night with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals, but are still trying to win their first division title.
“While we can’t get anything, at least we can get out on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team is likely to be at the highest level against any points I would play this year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why wouldn't I participate in such a competition?"
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nationals has not yet announced the starter for the week, but they are reportedly considering letting Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scherzer, to whom this would be the 34th time he opened the game, held training on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he otherwise rests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A right-handed Washington player this season leads 18-7 with an average earned runs of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
>>srp_Cyrl<< The president briefly referred to the situation his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, is in, during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved will be at stake in November.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These are some of the biggest - even though I am not running personally, I am actually running and that is why I am fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
They are determined to regain power by not choosing the means, see the mischief, dirty games.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “produce resistance and disruption.”
“You could have seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, spiteful, disgusting and insincere.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< He mentioned Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Ugh, what.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No, no, I'm waiting for him - it was very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn't surprise me at all.
I am only the last in a series of members of parliament from the Labour Party who have been told they are not welcome - just because we have expressed our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan River, went through the same thing because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, the irony is that these are similar topics that Jeremy disagreed on with previous leaders.
A notice to the Labour Party meeting in East Nottingham on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive".
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament from the Labour Party, Friday Night General Committee meetings have mostly been just that.
Unfortunately, meetings are rarely held in this spirit today, and the promise of a “nobler, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if there have ever been such aspirations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought shared similar political views began to expect me to change them from the ground up and take positions I would otherwise never agree with - whether it be national security or the EU single market.
Every public address I make, no matter what I say, follows a tirade of abuse on social media that calls for the annulment of my election, condemns the center’s policies, and says I don’t belong in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
I’m aware that I’m luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments I’m getting are usually political.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis without ever being distracted by it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The real truth is that we no longer accept different views and with each vote of mistrust or change in the rules of election, the party becomes more and more alienated.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised, urging me to lower my head, to keep my opinions to myself, and then I would “be fit.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< But it conflicts with my political goals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from a school bench, caused by the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government that allowed my school classroom to literally collapse, I have sought to fight for the provision of better public services to those in need - either as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my political commitment, not even in the last election.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and the topics around which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just like to say that, at a time when our country is rushing towards a Brexit that will threaten households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to the Momentum organisation of Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to the annulment of my election will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for East Nottingham.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two late essays may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr took a deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are now at the top of the table, as the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the end, the home team took the lead thanks to the superior defense, as well as the greater number of chances used and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in previous games and we haven't lost yet, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said: “All praise to Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, which was converted by Frasier Klimo, brought Ira an advantage, but the yellow card for Scotland's captain, Rory Hugh, whom the Warriors had taken out of the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott seized the unconverted essay.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Klimo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, at half-time, scoring and turning a solo essay for Ayr to come up with a 17-5 score at the break.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was then a longer hold-up due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was taken out on stretchers, and Ayr further increased the lead with an essay by Stafford McDowell, converted by Klimo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then Ira's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player more by having Bruce Colvin fail to convert the essay, after a short fierce pressure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the host side returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for wrestling with Klim without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson entered a touchdown behind the Ira mall in the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Klimo converted the essay, which he did again almost immediately into a sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent off Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth essay home side.
'Still Game' star prepares for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning he has been named CEO of a company that holds licensed restaurants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 56-year-old interprets the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he is a screenwriter and stars alongside long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of the show's broadcast and Kiernan appears to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
Bolivia stripped of access to sea, hopes court will allow it back into Pacific
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On public facilities, the flag of the color of the ocean is flown.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: “We have full right to the sea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We are obliged to bring him back."
>>srp_Cyrl<< In Bolivia, which has been stripped of access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it a longing for another voyage across the Pacific Ocean.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These hopes are perhaps the greatest in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia’s current development is going hand in hand, it is governed by a spirit of unity and tranquility and, of course, awaits the outcome in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the ceding of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For Eva Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin - who is expected to fight for re-election next year - the verdict to be handed down on Monday also carries a lot of risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed in late August.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia's favor - and that little would change if it did.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final arguments have been heard indicates that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And not only has the Bolivia case not progressed, but the previous four years may have set it back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Morales' belligerent rhetoric killed off any affection for Chile, she pointed out.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - had used the issue of the sea as a political base.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“This judgment is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen If It Doesn't Trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never dismantle the nuclear weapons program unless they have confidence in Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ri made a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit in talks between the conflicting leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to restart stalled diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ri says that it is only dreams that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, there is general skepticism when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness regarding giving up its nuclear arsenal which his country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows feature the latest lines of bulky head covering accessories you’ll soon see on the nearby main street
If you want to enrich the collection of hats with bulkier models or completely block the sun, the search is over.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of freaky huge head accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that eclipsed everyone at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely impractical hats set Instagram on fire this summer, and these designers showcased their impressive creations on the catwalk.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was an overemphasized beige hat adorned with a broad feather-like rim that swallowed the head of the model with its size.
Among other bulky additions were melons decorated with jewelry, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple - but they weren't designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks at the right time for Halloween.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many colorful masks had sutured lips and were more befitting Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled scuba diving equipment complete with a snorkel and mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cornet.
And if you’re building on the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details, you’re in luck.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Those who follow the trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn along the nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat "La Bomba" with a two-meter-wide perimeter that has been walked by many celebrities - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cult label on this impractical hat, which flooded social networks, stood behind another large creation featured on the runway - a straw beach bag almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
In Jaquemous’ collection “La Riviera” for spring/summer 2019 at the Fashion Week in Paris, the most prominent was a bag of raffia in the color of burnt orange, trimmed with raffia and with a white leather handle on top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will arrive in the main street next summer - since the designer has made such a boom, it would be hard to ignore that much demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test scores, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will get into their head.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you talk in his native language, it will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Based on the recent results of this year's tests, we see that languages are at the top of league tables with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade of A from Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In a 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey, of the reasons employers cited as the underlying problems when filling vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of knowledge of the language.
That is why language skills are given more and more importance in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given more potential business opportunities that require languages, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned another language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess a skill like this for life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks multiple languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language to speak a double-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
In every school in Scotland, different languages will be taught.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are thought to be most important for the United Kingdom viewed in advance in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be more languages available in independent schools to choose from, with teaching staff who are expert in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
It cannot be denied that nowadays, in the global business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so they must have their place in education as well.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered “the skills of international communication”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and exceptional achievements.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It comes to an end waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a week-long preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But his exact minutes have yet to be determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Laker reporter Mike Trudell posted a tweet that James was likely to have limited minutes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Donald Trump begins a series of rallies tonight as part of a campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for next week, with stays in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a delayed vote to confirm his nominee for the Supreme Court seat, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it goes to the polls in November.
What time is Trump going to hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch him online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia continue online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected Senate confirmation vote delayed by a week until the FBI completes its investigation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, this series of rallies is being held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the face of November elections.
Therefore, as part of President Trump's campaign, the five rallies to be held next week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The importance of Congress's control is so great for his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible at the start of the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016, will be his second in a month.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to raise it in the polls," Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination in the fight to stay in the game to meet singles matches on Sunday
>>srp_Cyrl<< After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon couples' tournament is perhaps just what Ryder Cup needs.
Although the variability of the momentum is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, and especially in competitions of this type.
So whose side would you say the momentum is on now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now four, so you can say that momentum is on our side," said Jordan Spitt.
Europe is, of course, ahead of us with four points of advantage and twelve more in the game.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although Americans, according to Spite, get a little wind in their backs and have a lot on their side, especially form Spite and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each have three points out of four.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Spit was lethal from first to last blow and gave everyone a homework assignment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cheers of delight grew louder throughout his round, to eventually play a key final kick and get a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas fell behind by two after two.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His final kick that won the 15-hole match was met with a similar scream, which reflects the belief that the American team is not out.
“Basically, you just have to do your best and take care of your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all these players can do.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 18 holes to leave a stamp.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are no doubt the story of the Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An unusual and at the same time charming European couple won all four matches and played without error.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who did not play God's shots on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the second half of Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience have solidified them as the top favorites on Sunday and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory at sunset over the Le Golf National club grounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European celebration.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bug Watson and Web Simpson quickly overcame Serge Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never even managed to spring.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although, on Sundays, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
The four-ball game and the couples tournament are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the tips they give and don’t give and the ways in which the strategy can change at a moment’s notice.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great lead ahead of the final day, but this session of the doubles tournament has also shown that the US team has a desire to fight that some doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads by 10-6 ahead of the final day in the Ryder Cup
>>srp_Cyrl<< Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, having gained a 10-6 advantage over the United States after Saturday's matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took first with two wins over the disgruntled Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on the grounds of the Le Golf National Club to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which struggled to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in a four-ball game this morning and won the series 3-1.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The United States put up more resistance in the pairs tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jim Fourik's side must win eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then combined splendidly and overcame pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Deshambo with an even more convincing 5-4.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, gleamed at moments, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball game and in a doubles tournament and seven in a row.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning's four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the pair's tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka - first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not go as planned on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Three-time Majors tournament winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They racked up a 2-1 victory over John Ram and Jan Poulter in a four-ball game, to later come back and beat Poulter and Rory McElroy 4-3 in the pair's tournament, after losing the first two holes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only twice in Ryder Cup history did some team come back after a four-point gap before single matches, although Furik's side, who defend the title, have enough draw to keep the trophy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, after already two days in second place, it seems that Sunday's counterattack would be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says 'no talk' of unilateral disarmament if no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country would by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "significant measures over the past year to show goodwill", such as suspending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“There is no response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no talk of us being the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for its steps, his statement was significant because he did not throw unilateral denuclearization out of the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States is not giving up on ‘denuclearization first’ and increasing the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its goal by force, even opposing ‘the declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“That they think sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But the problem is that extending sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If we were negotiating this problem of denuclearization with South Korea, not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such a dead end.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Rio’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he said at the UN General Assembly that shooting at the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said there was still more work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea carried out denuclearization.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump said on Wednesday that he had not set a timeline for this, saying, "If it's supposed to take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and without caveats until full, final, confirmed denuclearization occurs.”
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to prevent the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made and North Korea would condemn him after just a few hours for making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile test site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” required by Trump are security guarantees in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Get Enough Sleep
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning "all night long with the help of caffeine".
>>srp_Cyrl<< One academic noted that the number one university students in the world are often ignorant of the basic care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The idea of this course was given after a speech he held on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“One girl finally came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year of study?’
>>srp_Cyrl<< She said that no one ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is held for the first time this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports performance, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was noticed that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course covers a range of interactive tasks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In one section is an image of a room in the dorm and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the second part, participants listen to how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But we believe they have the right to know that - just as everyone has the right to know what the health consequences of smoking cigarettes are," added Professor Chaisler.
A culture of pride in “sleeplessness all night long” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and a quality one, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep the brain goes into starvation mode, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Chaisler design the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He says this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance at the campus level.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The next step, as it is hoped, would be for all postgraduates to be required to undergo a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students think about setting the alarm in time for sleep and wakefulness and take care of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerard's team with a goal
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers had another drop in guests when Dolly Menga kicked Steven Gerard's scattered team into a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The team from Ibrox Stadium sought to take the first away victory after a February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard as manager only a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind unbeaten Ladbrokes Premier League leaders, the Harts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Menga kicked seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' uninspired lineup never came close to an even.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone climbs to third behind Hibernian just because of the goal difference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers may face additional problems after line judge Calum Spence had to be shown help due to a head wound after being shot on the side with an object.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gerard made eight changes to the team that had outgrown Ayr and placed in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took a point to the Harts last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He missed a little to score just two minutes after Meng's first pass into empty space sent Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a big chance and kicked past the goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kegan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow kicked past the goal at the second easel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last line gave off more hope than faith in themselves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received the penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers made only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox Stadium goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, defended the kick with Lassana Koulibali's head without major problems and tamed the shot that directed Ovie Eyaria.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true power ratio during the game, no one can dispute that he was credited if for nothing else, then for the effort put in.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers again could not cope with the deep-played action of Jacobs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher slipped the ball to Sloto Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the winger hired Morelos, but an impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Livingston continued to get guests to play just as they suited, with long balls from Lithgow and Halket.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held on well and defended the Jacobs attack, and then sent Lithgo from the corner with the ball past the goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Glenn Middleton, Rangers' replacement, was looking for another penalty at the end of the game when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not react again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the mainstays of science, Geiger counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Bells, starring seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Evans: "Look, it's really being heard!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to recognize and kill depraved cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then re-inject them.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer retreated for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that occurs in many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has proven itself well in treating one type of leukemia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kanye West joined the fierce attacks in Trump's defense, wearing a MAGA-labeled cape, after a guest appearance on the SNL show.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for some political office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, "Ghost Town," with a "Make America Great" catchphrase, he gave a ferocious speech against the Democrats and once again supported Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who would say, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The SNL show aired a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blazey Ford's sexual abuse claims.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted a video of West's heated speech to social networks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of Vesta with this announcement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of the cap he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They threatened me!
>>srp_Cyrl<< And then they say I sank," he said, reports the Washington Examiner.
The news continued, “Would you like to see what it looks like?” adding that he would “put on Superman’s mantle because it means you can’t give me orders.
Then spread the love."
The audience at least twice booed his remarks, and it seemed as if the members of the SNL show were uncomfortable, Variety reported, while one of the attendees told the magazine: “The whole studio was in pain.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The news at the last minute replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, passed away a few days ago.
The news confused many with his performance of the song "I Love It", disguised in a bottle of Perrier water.
The news received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOT BEING RESOLVED TO VIOLENTS.”
However, Karen Hunter, the host of the TV show, tweeted that West was simply “his own and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and extols an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "going to be known as Kanye West".
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is not the first performer to change his name - before him it was done by Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in Belfast restaurant
>>srp_Cyrl<< A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The incident occurred on Ballyhackamore Street, police said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defendants are expected to appear before a misdemeanor court in Belfast on Monday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The public prosecutor's office will consider the aforementioned charges.
Game of Thrones Star Keith Harrington Condemns Devastating Macho Culture
Keith Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy full of violence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of such on-screen roles, young men often feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith stated his view that "something went wrong" and addressed how to deal with the problem of devastating macho culture in the #JaIto era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m quite troubled right now by the question: What did we do wrong with representing masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading the pernicious macho culture due to portraying characters posing as men.
He added: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain mold of a man’s behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the main issues of our time - how do we change that?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Because obviously something went wrong with the young man."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the "Game of Thrones" prequels or sequels upon its completion the following summer, saying he was "done with battlefields and horses".
Kit will star in Sam Shepard's "True West" from November - the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his current wife Rose to be the best thing the Game of Thrones series has brought him.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rose played Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this fantasy series that is the Emmy-winning winner.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase
>>srp_Cyrl<< China has announced a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS of 14%.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus is transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China in the past as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Transmission of HIV through sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people is very widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Transmission of the virus also often occurs due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters has denied allegations that any of her staff have released data on GOP senators, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
>>srp_Cyrl<< U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has denied allegations that any of her staff published personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat pointed out that these claims are made by experts and websites of the “ultra-right wing”.
“Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, of Utah.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Commission hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The disclosure came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address identifying the source of the announcement was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate claims - is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Waters' statement quickly sparked condemnation on the Internet, which was also made by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is exasperating,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When someone is accused of something he did not do, he must not be angry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He must not be impertinent.
It does not question the prosecutor’s motives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He must be calm and calm."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, whom critics accused of acting too furiously at Thursday's hearing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters's shift in the midterm elections, also made an appearance on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” he tweeted.
Ms Waters said her office had informed “appropriate competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Review of the film "Johnny English - Back in Action" - lukewarm satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for the subtext of Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this continuation of the satirical action comedy franchise about Johnny English - which started back in 2003 with the creation of "Johnny English" and came back to life in 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Is an ironic autosatry about what obvious trash we are going to be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the obnoxious, incompetent Johnny English with a face like a tire got another opportunity to mess something up - with his name more than anything else revealing that it is a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinema audience English is not their native language.
It is, of course, about a cunning secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries within him a little Clouseau, a speck of Mr Bean and a crumb of that boy who played only one note within the themed melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was also originally based on a traveler and a mysterious man in international frames whom Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this latest installment on Johnny English, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked the one where Johnny English walks up to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly rattle about his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially considering that “serious” movie brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, now regularly include comic elements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Humor leaves the impression as being intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's freakish mishaps are not as inventive and elaborate to a tanchin as Atkinson's gags in the style of silent films when he interpreted Bean.
It is now a very topical issue that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of an agent on duty - unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character designed after Theresa May, but the script is quite poor.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies are compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
It's head-and-beard Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of the film School of Rock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< English returns to Whitehall for instructions after the emergency procedure and reunites with former patient, sidekick Bow, who is re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bow is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, in an interpretation by Vicky Pepperdine that is somewhat redundant.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And so scruffy and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's Secret Service and luckily the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Bouletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< English and Bau begin their odyssey of comical adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant, real chaos by smuggling onto Volta's luxury yacht and English launches a real anarchy by trying to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house using virtual reality headsets.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into that last sequence, but no matter how sympathetic and cheerful, the entire film seems to have been made for children.
Pretty average quality.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with some role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
Labour denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and be paid for five.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the time they save thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an extra day off.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend - but would still receive the same salary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sources say that the idea would "fit" into the party's economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that there will be a review of the legislation before the end of the year.
“Change will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that includes access to a party’s funding to turn it into an industry-wide benefit.”
The Labour Party was not the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party has made a commitment to a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, such a trend is currently not shared by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party's spokesman says, "The week after yesterday's work is not a part of the party's agenda, and the party is not a part of it."
Shadow Minister John Macdonald used the recent Labour Party conference to lay out his vision of a socialist revolution in the field of transport.
Mr. Macdonald pointed out the determination to get as much as possible out of the “wicked directors” and “pro-fitters” in the public sphere.
The Shadow Minister's plans also suggest that the current shareholders in the offshore companies may not be able to get their entire share because they would be a bulwark.
He also confirmed plans to add 500 employees to the management board of the company and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds, through which 10 of them would be owned by private companies.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 minutes" if they can reconsider the FBI investigation into the Cavanaugh case.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh would have sent her away less than a day after the final vote on his appointment as a member of the Supreme Court.
In an interview aired on Sunday, the show's "60 Minutes" director Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Greem if the FBI would consider it a good idea to do so.
Kennedy was more open than his counterpart in South Carolina.
“I think so,” said Kennedy.
“I said, going to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when he pressed charges, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, he was settled, he was unambiguous."
It seems, however, that Greem's voice was cast into the stone.
"I have made my decision on Bret Cavanaugh and it would not have been changed by a more serious accusation," he said.
“I don’t know what it was with Dr. Ford, but I know this: Bret has all decidedly refused,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blaisey Ford.
"And no one she can recall can confirm it.
That's from 36 years ago.
I wouldn't say something new is going to happen."
What is the “Global Citizen” Festival and has anyone contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the home of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a long and impressive roster of performers and nothing short of an impressive mission.
The seventh annual Global Citizen Festival, and the next big thing in 2030, would be Central Park, and it would be visited by tens of thousands of people, and they wouldn't just enjoy the spectacle.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012 to promote the country's economy, is leading the way for the creation of a project to eradicate global poverty, for the first time in the world, and for the first time for the first time in the history of the world.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the visitors of the concert had to do a series of back-to-back, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending them to the event.
But how much success has the Global Citizen achieved, given the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding a blind date to a blind date the right way for people to convince them to ask for an action, or is it just another case of a so-called "click-through"?
Global Citizen’s organizers claim that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million actions of their supporters aimed at achieving a number of different goals.
They claim that these actions are helping the world's leaders survive by 2030 by establishing goals and targets worth more than 37 billion dollars that would affect people's lives.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 goals and goals that had emerged from its actions, for which it had already paid or collected less than 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the collected funds have so far been directly impacted by 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key programs include the Power of Nutrition, a partnership with investors and contractors based in the UK in order to "drive children to grow up in their full capacity".
“With the support of the UK government, the donor, the national government in 2018 and the citizens of the world, like you, we are socially disadvantaged in terms of not being able to transform into a citizen.”
The group also stated that it had more than five thousand targets and that the United Kingdom was called upon to better feed its mothers and children, the government said.
It's one of the many questions we've asked on our website, which are the voices "for what reason do you think we should be able to exorcise extreme poverty?"
A global citizen responds: “It will be a long and hard road, and it will be a failure and a fall.
But as great human rights have been chosen before us, and as they have succeeded in correcting the opposition to apartheid, we will succeed because we are together more capable.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monnet are some of the performers who will be performing at this year's event in New York City, whose hosts will be
U.S. could use Navy to block Russian energy, Interior Minister says
Washington may “need” to rely on its Navy to make it possible for Russian energy to reach the holiday market, including the Middle East, he said.
Zinki has made it clear that Russia’s engagement in Syria is where, in particular, it is intruding on the call of the legitimate authority to explore new energy markets.
“I think it’s because of their presence in the Middle East that they want to sell their energy, much like they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.
And according to this official, there are ways and means by which it can be stopped.
"The United States has the possibility, with the help of our sailors, to secure the opening of the sea lanes, and to require them to block them, so that they can secure the passage of the sea lanes."
Zinki addressed those present at the event in the organization of the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that calls itself the "Voice of Energy Consumers".
He further promoted Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, arguing that they were essentially the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and re-energize,” he said, telling Russia that he was “the one who knows” about three of them.
These statements come at a time when Trump's administration is trying to tell us about its current natural gas in Europe, which is replacing Russia.
Because of this goal, officials from the Trump administration are being made by the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, trying to convince the Germans to "let go."
Moscow's more like it. It's 110 mil. It's worth 11 billion dollars. It's supposed to double its capacity.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s brutal stance on this one-stop-shop project has been underscored by economic woes and overtaken by an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we need to make sure that the energy we use is used to exert pressure, and that the consumers need to have the opportunity to choose a source of energy.”
The U.S. has provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has invited the United States not to meddle in the energy policy of the European Union and the European Union.
“I’m very concerned about the interference of the third countries in our supply of energy,” said Dieter Cemff, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) in a statement.
Elisabet Waren will "think well" about the 2020 presidential bid, according to a Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “think twice” about running for president after the midterms.
At a meeting with the city administration in Hollok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and join our dysfunctional government, and that includes the woman on top,” Hill said.
“After November 6th, I’ll think twice about running for president.”
During her meeting with the city administration, she criticized President Donald Trump, saying that “he is leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
He has been openly critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “We need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that even in her own electoral district, most of the voters did not think that Warren would need to vote.
I've had five out of the "credible" voters in Massachusetts say the senator shouldn't be running for office, according to pollsters at the University of Massachusetts.
Three hundred and twenty-two percent supported such a bid.
The poll showed support for ex-governor Deval Patrik, with 38 out of support for the presidential candidate and 48 out of votes against.
Other soundings from the period of the democrates, which were mentioned in connection with the possible candidate for 2020, include the former vice president Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make the official decision by January, passing it to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Commemorates Post-Traumatically Stressful Disruption of Palin's Truck at Donald Trump's Rally
Truk Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with an incident involving violence in the family.
"That's what my son is going through, that's what's going to happen to me" is coming back, and I can tell you about other families that have been affected by PTSD and some of the things I've been through since then.
He described his approach to them as a "second example of a great problem that everyone ignores and says about his son and the other wartime: "They're coming back to the other one."

18 States and the District of Columbia Maintained Reexamination of New Asylum Provisions
Eight states and the District of Columbia have maintained a proper examination of the new U.S. legislation that provides for the refusal to provide asylum to victims who have fled the country.
On Friday, the heads of 18 states and the Colombian district submitted a petition through a “friend of the court” in support of an asylum seeker who wants to share the paperwork, CNN reported.
There's a lot of regrets in the Gray's Opposite Porch, and the counter to the U.S. Code has been broken by the U.S. Covenant on Civil Liberties.
She said that her partner "and his sons, gang members" had been mean to her, but U.S. officials on June 20 rejected her request for asylum.
She's being held in Texas.
State attorneys who provide legal support to Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, countries where a large number of asylum seekers have come from in the United States, as well as in the United States.
The new U.S. law on asylum was repealed in 2014 by a decision made by the U.S. Board on Immigrant Claims, and by an immigrant who was not a resident of the United States.
The top lawmaker in Columbia County, Charles Reysin, said on Friday that the new law “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all decisions on all asylum claims be made on the basis of specific facts and circumstances presented in the request, and so on.
The lawyers further stated in the document that the regulation by which the immigrants were to be removed was detrimental to the U.S., saying that they were more likely to appear to be those who were left behind by the immigrants and "the
Top lawmaker Jeff Sessions has called for immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who abandon their ancestral land because of persecution or fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, or belonging.
The purpose of asylum has never been to solve all the problems - even serious problems - that people all over the world face all the time.
Desperately trying to save the city of Paloo, the number of dead doubles as long as the race for survivors continues.
The survivors were faced with an increasingly dire situation.
“It’s very up,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusum, pacifying her little boy who is crying feverishly in the Evacuation Center in the desolate city of Palu.
“Emergency car on every minute of the body.
There's not enough clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up after scraps of stuff, and trying to save as much as they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude quake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwya Harris, who suffered spinal and temporal injuries, lay outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients had been treated.
His eyes filled with tears told him how he felt as the ground shook violently the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It was not the time to be saved.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for a wedding celebration.
“I’ve heard my wife talk about it, and then it’s quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Crime by Misdemeanor'
A week later, the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page report in a daily newspaper in the United States, highlighting the widespread benefits of trade between the U.S. and China.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned that he had been paid to work at the Tea Party at the Demoyne Registry in Iowa, and that he had sold the list to the U.S. government.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election are what U.S. officials have described to Reuters as a new phase in the Washington campaign.
Even though it's normal for the U.S. government to publish a campaign statement in order to facilitate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war in the United States.
The goal of China’s retaliatory customs in the early phase of the trade war was to make expatriates from countries like Iowa, which maintains Trump’s Republican party, and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged the country's economy.
As Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of the Demoyne Register, China “now makes us even more public with its scandalous editorials in our own free time.”
“I spread my propaganda, the Chinese authorities use the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, publishing a pay-per-view
“On the other hand, in a newsstand on the street in Beijing, you’re going to have a little bit of conflicting voices, and you’re not going to see any real conflict of opinion.
He added that “one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused an offer to publish” his article, but he did not say which one it was.
Analysts are urging Republicans to alienate themselves from women's suffrage before a midterm election, for the sake of screwing Judge Cavanaugh.
Although many from the top of the Republican Party maintain and defend candidates for membership of Bret Cavanaugh's Supreme Court, they face higher charges of sexual misconduct.
The emotions associated with this situation are extremely strong, and for most Republicans, they already know they want to give him their vote.
Such things are impossible to bear,” pointed out Grant Richer, professor of political science at the Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Richer has expressed the suspicion that instituting Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) on the FBI investigation in the last minute will be enough to appease the injured voter.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget tomorrow, or in November,” said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior advisor to the president.
On Friday morning, the Demonstrats shouted, "Come November!" as they marched into the Senate corridor, after the Republicans, who control the Justice Department.
“Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will reach unsuspecting levels,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-Western political activist, told this news site.
“People say it’s already on the high ground, that’s right.
But it can continue to grow, especially among the indecisive female voters of the suburbs and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote, in spite of their age.
Even before the public testimony in which Ford's office had detailed the allegations of sexual misconduct against a candidate for the position of a member of the Supreme Court,
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” he said recently to NBC News’ Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
“It’s not just about the vote, it’s about the final vote, it’s about whether or not it’s going to end up in court, it’s about the way the Republicans have done it, and it’s about the way they’ve done it.
However, it does seem that the Americans have been divided on the question of who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with some of the more recent ones being
A new poll conducted by the agency, JuGov, shows that 41 percent of respondents believe definitively or likely to believe that Ford's testimony is true, while 35 percent of them believe that Ford's testimony is true.
In addition, 38 of them said they thought he had lied about Ford in all his testimony, while only 30 of them thought the same about Ford.
Insisting Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as one person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford's report came just after the incident. She was told by the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh was in an alcoholic state when he attacked them.
Ramirez claims that her bid for a member of the Supreme Court showed her genius for the party they attended during Yale’s studies in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup project that aims to become a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent design of this technological backdrop, Inrupt, is the company built on the Berners-Left platform of the open-plan Solid.
Solid users will be able to choose where their returns will be stored and who will be able to access which information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company magazine, Berners-Lee found that he had a clue who was hiding behind the Inrupt project.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the building.
“This is an historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their “personal space for online storage back then,” or after.
It may contain contacts, background lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
It's just that the only thing that's personal about online storage is that it's only dependent on the user to access the information.
The company called it "personally based across the board".
The idea behind Inrupt, as Gen. John Bruce says, is that the company provides resources, processes, and answers to skills that would help everyone to make a difference.
The company is currently meeting from Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several of them permanent contractors engaged in the operation.
Starting from this week, I've been demonstrating all over the world that I can do with my own decentralization applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a full change to who their business is going to be.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a post published on Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help to protect it."
In 1994, Werners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been one of the influential voices in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Although the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Endowments Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the network,” said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Adoration to the Priest of the First World War, bearer of the Victoria Cross
To the only priest of the Church of England, who has been awarded the 100th Cross of Victoria as a fighter for the time of the First World War, he pays his respects in his home town.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van served this award on September 29, 1918, in the same manner as Belangliz and Leokur.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never knew he had received the most British military distinction.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a piece of cloth in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the tablet was discovered exactly 100 years after he had served it.
Before the London Gazette, on the 29th of September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van took his baton over to Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog, beneath the
Then he stormed the fire line, and with the "greatest heroism" he led the way back to where he had single-handedly attacked the artillery and pulled the gun out of his three-man squad.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it's something that causes a great deal of pain."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, were also awarded the award after a pair led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "it's going to be very much appreciated for what he did in the parade" and added that "he's the hero of the game."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, and instead got Pep Prase
Imagine that you stayed awake all night trying to watch Belator 206, and that you were incapacitated to watch the main event.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The San Jose event involved 13 tackles, including a six in the main and in the UK he was featured live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., the darkness when Gerard Musasi and Rory Macdonald were getting ready to face each other, the views in the UK were lost when they were passed over by a skirmisher in Peppu.
Some of them were told after they stayed awake until early morning to fight you.
One fan described the cartoon’s rendition of a child on Twitter as “a kind of sick joke.”
“According to the state code, that 6 a.m. content wasn’t locked up, so they had to fish out the kids,” said Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president at B.C.C.
"'Pepa Pig', yes."
The president of the company, Belator Scot Coker, said he would work on his pro-gramming scheme to include a UK audience in the future.
“I think as far as the re-prize is concerned, I think we’re going to be able to do it right,” Coker said.
“But there’s a six in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to get that done until the week after our time, the week after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when he crossed the line, he made a lot of calls, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical issue.
But it wasn't, it was a problem to the state.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're going to hold on to the five fights we've been able to do for six -- as usual -- we've tried to make sure that we've done more of the usual and the only thing we've ever done.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There is an unfortunate situation at stake."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Felt 'Inferior' About Sexuality
Olympian Tom Daley says he's grown up with feelings of inferiority in one way or another for the sake of his sex life - but it's given him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old says that until I started elementary school, I didn’t realize that “they’re not all like him.”
In a talk on Radio 4's first issue of Desert Island Discs with director Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay making it so that he could give someone else a "day."
He also said he was less concerned about winning the Olympics since he was a parent.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off from illness.
In the first broadcast of Laverne, Daley said that he felt "less worthy" than others until he had grown up because "it wasn't social."
He said, "Until today, it feels like I'm worth less and I'm different, those were the things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “something or nothing,” he said, as if he wouldn’t have told everyone when they were about to learn about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent fighter for LGBT rights and has taken advantage of his appearance at this year's Olympic Games in Amsterdam.
He said that he had spoken because he felt happy that he could live in the open, without a trace, and because he wanted others to "come".
The world’s three-time champion says he was “surprised” by his love affair with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley's been married to a widower who's 20 years older than he is, but he says it's not like he's ever had a problem.
“When you go through it so much at such an early age,” and at the first Olympics he went away for 14 years, and his father died three years later.
The two of them became parents in June, they had Robert Ray Black-Daily's son, and Daley told him to "read the prospects."
“If you had asked me about it, it would have been just ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what’s more important than the Olympic gold medals.
Robby's my gold Olympic medal."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being discovered to have cancer.
Daley says his father didn't accept that he was going to die first, and that one of his last questions was whether he already had a ticket to the 2012 Olympics in London.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t live to be in the first row,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he was breathing, and it was only when he was breathing that he died that I finally realized he wasn’t needed,” he said.
Next up, Mr. Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew for one thing that what I had dreamed of all my life was going to happen to an audience at the Olympic Games, it didn’t feel any better,” he said.
This sentiment also inspired his selection of the first song “Prude” by Heather Small, who was with him in preparation for the Olympics, and from which he continued to pass.
The TV show Desert Island is being broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. on British summer time.
Michelson due to fall out of the form on the bench for Saturday Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a date on the Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to go back to the game to avoid a chance.
Michelson, who is participating in this two-year-old engagement for the 12th time, captain Jim Furrick has been sent to the bench for Saturday's game with four balls and a game to play.
Instead of being in the middle of an action, like he used to be so often in the United States, a five-time champ will do part of it as a cheerleader and part of the team.
Since even at the height of his career he was not the most precise in his many strokes, this 48-year-old is not the ideal candidate for the narrow field of golf.
And if I'm still in the field, it's not enough to encourage him, Michaelson is in his ninth match in a week, facing off against the British champ.
If the Americans, who are four in arrears, start 12 singles, they'll have a tough start, Michelson's match could be absolutely judgmental.
Furik pointed out that he had faith in his own man, although he couldn't say anything else.
“He fully understood the moment he had today, he patted me on the back, he hugged me and said he’d be ready for tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame, and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and then this week.
I guess I didn't plan on him playing two swords.
I've planned more, but that's how it worked out, and that's the path we've decided we should go.
He wanted to be there as much as anyone else."
Michelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most of the weekly matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the height of his personal record.
Michelson had 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven fumbles, but Furrick said his absence was felt in the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to joke with people and it’s great to have him in a team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to watch him, and this time around, it was fun to watch.
He's a lot more than just a game."
European Capt. Thomas Bjorn knows that a great transition is about to happen.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant past is on the eve of the last day of the singles at the Ryder Cup that he can easily preempt.
Danac was fated in 1997 in a match at Walderham, where he was the one who led Seve Balestrer past the five-point mark at Americans, but he's still in the middle of it.
“I’m constantly thinking about how we had a great time in 2018 with Walderham; we had a great time in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderham, where we had a great time.
So, the story will show me and everyone on that team that there's no end to it.
We're going full steam tomorrow.
Let's get out there and do what we have to do.
Nothing's ready until you get back on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to conquer this trophy, and that will remain the focus.
I keep saying that, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what happens to the opposite sides - the best players in the world."
Fueled by the game of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run over the ore for that.
Tomorrow's something else entirely.
Tomorrow's individual effect is coming to fruition, and that requires a different game.
It's nice to be there with a partner when they really need to, but when you're there alone, then your golf cap's full.
It's a message you have to cross with the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he has to come out and do everything for himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furrick's team captains are looking for their players to do better than the one they've done with their partners, except for Jordan Spitt and Jordan Spitt.
And Furik himself was on both sides of these great crossroads in the last day, first as part of the Brooklyn team, and then as a loser when the European team went "Miracle in Me."
“I remember literally every word of it,” he replied, asking how Ben Cranshaw, a 1999 captain, had raised the morale of his players while they were on the move.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important swords, but it would be good to have a fast start like the one you’ve seen in Brooklyn and the one you’ve seen in Medina.
When you cross that line in one direction, there's a lot of pressure on the middle of the sword.
We're making our post here, and we're making the guys what we think they should be, you know, trying to do a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a counter-offensive, and he's facing Rory Mackilly in the final match, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Joni Tomp.
“I was going with this group of guys in that group because I think we’re doing it that way,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual month.
A New Retreat for the New German Warship
It's the latest on the German Navy. It was supposed to go into service in 2014, so it would replace the old warship ships from the Cold War, but it wouldn't.
Rainland-Falz, the lead ship of the new freighter, Baden-Wirttemberg, has now been rescheduled to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after the delivery of the supplies damaged the future of this ambitious project.
The four ships that Mr. Mornaritz ordered in 2007 were Budden-Wirttemberg, two of whom were retired from Bremen.
It's been known that he's gonna be able to hold a cannon, a string of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as a certain amount of technology, like in the past, in the course of his career.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of work without holding the event - it should be possible for the most recent flyovers to take place within two years of the event.
However, the constant delay means that these ships of war will be in service, and it is necessary for Germany to be able to project its power into the sea.
The ill-fated F125 has made it to the newsstands in New York City after a year in which a German Navy official refused to take it in and return it to the ship.
It was the first time the Navy had ever returned to the shipyard on a ship after delivery.
Little is known about the return, but the German media have made more crucial "defections on software and hardware" that would make these warships the ship of choice.
Software shortages were particularly important, and it would have been much more difficult for the Baden-Wirttemberg to manage than about 120 seafaring people.
Also, it turns out that the weight of the ship is a drastic crossing, which would have reduced its capacity and limited the possibility of the Navy to it later in the year.
It seems that the Rhineland-Falz weighs 7,000 tons and is twice as heavy as the ships that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In addition to the fickle hardware, the cost of the entire project - including on-site training - also started to get in the way of the problem.
They say that it has reached a new 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - from an initial 2.2 billion euros.
He's having trouble with his latest frigate, and he's obviously coming to show off in the light of some of the most recent warnings about reducing German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the board of directors for the German parliament, confirmed to the Navy that they had "repeated the ship's service".
This official pointed out that over time, things are getting more and more serious, because the ships are happy without the introduction of alien craft.
He expressed regret that none of the Budden-Wirttembergs had been able to join the Navy.
NATIONAL FUND Eavesdropping on Secret Lives of Blind Mice
The new research that is being done on a single property in Scotland is aimed at discovering how bats use geographies to match the terrain in their search for food.
The researchers hope that the new light will shine on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and assist in directing future activities towards them.
STUDY OF SCIENTISTS FROM THE NATIONAL FUND FOR SCOTTIAN FRIENDS WILL BLIND THE BLIND MUSCLES, LIKE THE LONG-EARNED LILLS AND THE LUNCH IN THE INVERSE
Special imaging devices will be placed at key locations across a wide range of assets in order to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
Staff and volunteers of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) will also undergo extensive testing with hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the blind mice's voice and what kind of work they're doing.
Then a detailed map of the area will be prepared, along with a report on how the image of their behavior in the other area would be obtained.
Rob Djouar, conservation advisor to the Fund, hopes that the results will reveal which regions of the population are the most important for the bats and which cause them to become extinct.
These informations will contribute to determining the future of my community's landscaping, such as landscaping, as well as the way in which forests can best be managed.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has dropped significantly in the past century.
They are preceded by construction and natural works that affect their nesting and loss of habitation.
Vetrogenators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as sticky fly runs and some types of chemical treatments of building materials and home remedies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Blind mice in fact are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They rely on sophisticated echo-locating techniques to pinpoint the exact position of the cut and cut in the way they travel in the summer.
The NTS Fund, which is responsible for the care of approximately 270 buildings of historical significance, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious.
The fund has a number of trained experts who perform research in a regular manner, check the nesting grounds, and sometimes rescue operations.
This organization has even created the first and only national reservation for bats in Scotland, with Trive in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, which is at about eight o'clock in the morning.
David Thompson's property manager says this property is ideal territory for them.
“Here in Trive, we have a great blind spot for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, enough old trees, and in general good housing.
But there's a lot about bats that we still don't know, and we're gonna work here and we're gonna have other people to help us better understand what they need to know so that we can help them.
He understands the importance of verifying the presence of blind mice before carrying out work in a store of property, because by the accidental destruction of one nesting place
Blind mice are protected and it is counterproductive to kill them, harass them or disturb and destroy their nesting grounds.
Elisabet Ferrell, the Scottish official at the Blind Mice Protection Fund, encourages the public to include their contributions.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don't know how to deal with the numbers."
RONALDO REJECTS RAPE ACCUSATIONS, ADVOCATES AGAINST THE CASE AGAINST THE GERMAN CHASE
Christiano Ronaldo described the accusations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying that people “wanted to promote themselves” by using his name.
His attorneys are asking to sue the German magazine Speagle, which published you here.
An attacker from Juventus and Portugal has been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Turning 142 million of his friends into "Instagram Live" video after the indictment was announced, Ronaldo (33) dismissed the report as "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
That’s what they said today, fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“They want to use my name.
That's normal.
He wants to make sure he's as famous as he's gonna say my name, but that's what he's doing.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Speagle over the allegations, which they described as “an unacceptable report of suspicion in the private sphere.”
Advokat Christian Scherz said that the football player would be looking for “moral damage in an amount that matches the weight of the cross, which is in the balance of the cross.”
The incident happened in June 2009 in an apartment in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were sent back to the player's room, where he had been subjected to an accidental act of violence.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, fell on his knee, claiming that he was "99 good guys" but that he had let go of those "one of them".
In the documents, he claimed that Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was on a good basis.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police with photos of her injuries done in the hospital, but that she eventually accepted the extrajudicial offer because she felt the "terror" of the hospital.
This 34-year-old says she wants to break the deal now because she still has a trauma about the incident.
In the time of the attack, Ronald was just a step away from Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this year he was in Italy for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would never have made a loss’ to car makers
The UK “would never have crossed over” if Brexit had lost the status of the world’s leader in the car’s last production, says minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "concerned" by what Toyota UK had said to the BBC that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal had been reached, it had inadvertently broken up in the vicinity of the B&B.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer said it would be borderline in the Brexit case without agreeing to cause a loss of jobs.
The factory in Barnaston - which produces thojota auris and avensis - has produced nearly 150,000 cars in the past year, of which 90% are exported to the rest of Europe.
“My point of view is that we’re going to have a booty sale in the factory if Britannia makes her way out of the EU,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota’s factory in Barnaston.
Other car makers in the UK, including Honda, Be-M-We and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreeing on a functioning cross-border deal.
Be-M-We, for example, says that after Brexit, one month from today, he's going to shut down his factory at the Minnie Marks in Oxford.
The main concerns about them are the risks involved with supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers say.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “just in time” principle, where parts of the ordering car arrive every 37 minutes from the UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement of 29 March, it can come to the border where industry leaders say it can come to the delay and the end of the world.
Tojo couldn't store an inventory for more than one day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company announced, so the production would have been completed.
Clark says that Tereza May's plan for Checkers is in a relationship with the future EU "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks."
“We need to have a consensus. We want to have a fourth-best consensus that will make it possible for us, as I would say, not just a momentary success, but also the use of it.”
“The evidence is not just from Toyota, it’s from other contractors, and they say we absolutely have to be able to do what we’re told.
TOYOTE CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH IT WOULD TAKE TO LOSE THE CONSTRUCTION, BUT IT MAKES IT LONGER TO MAKE THE COST
Peter Cuvalaris, who works for 24 years in Barnastoun, and who is a functionary of the Union of June in the factory, says that his members are all more concerned: "My experience is that I am a child of
The spokesman said: “We have devised a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
An important meeting. Donald Trump with Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "retired for one more week" as far as we're concerned.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Maler, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, between Trump's aide and Russia's aide-de-camp and the possibility of
It's a question of whether Trump will replace the deputy top reformer or not, and put the team at risk of Mueller's independency, it's already months away from the prospect of a promotion to Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the wiretapping process for recording Trump's conversation and the possibility of a trip to the United States.
Rosenstein turned that down.
But last week, he went to the White House, and I'm telling you, he's getting ready to leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't have changed" Rosenstein, but he did have a meeting that was adjourned to avoid a hearing in court.
On Friday, Trump made a one-week investigation by the FBI into the allegations made against Kavanaugh, pending a vote by the entire Senate.
Trump's prime minister for the press, Sarah Sanders, made a call to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein, she replied: “It’s not yet settled in date, it could be this week, it could be another day, it could be another day, it could be another day.
But we'll see, and I'll always make sure to keep my eye on things."
Some reporters might argue that Sanders hasn't held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asked about it.
Sanders said that the disclosure of the statement was not the result of a denial to the reporter's "attract attention," but he said, "I wouldn't refuse to accept it."
That's why she's committed to strengthening the direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president has more authority than any other president to answer questions about him,” she said, without elaborating, “we’ve checked on that.”
And there will be further announcements, Sanders said, but “if the novices have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that’s a new question.”
We've tried to do that a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot." We've done it a lot, and it's going to happen, and it's going to happen, and it's going to happen, and it's going to happen, and it's going to happen.
Trump has been asked to leave the White House or take part in open sessions or news conferences with the visiting officials.
Single-conferences for the press are rare.
The president this week in New York may have shown for the sake of that, since he was in front of the assembled newcomers acting casually, and in front of us as well as in business.
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU employees in the National Health Service of Scotland about the fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express her country’s gratitude and to invite them to stay.
The ambassador of the Scottish Parliament, Gene Freeman, sent a letter at a time when it was less than six months away from the UK leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of the complaints it has made about the residence of EU citizens who work in its public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The UK exit talks from the EU were set up during that summer, going to the expected autumn decisions.
But the U.K. government is also preparing for a possible scenario without reaching a deal.
I know this must be upsetting time for all of you.
So now I want to reiterate how much I would like to contribute to each member of the staff, without regard to the public.
Our colleagues from the different parts of the European Union, both abroad and abroad, bring us valuable experience and skills that enable us to create and improve health services, to benefit our patients and their families.
"Scotland is unquestionably your home, and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie was urgently examined after he suffered a head injury.
Leinbecker Tennessey State Teaser Christion Aberkrombi was rushed through after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's resulting 31-27 from the
Tennessean head coach Rod Reed said he had to make sure the head injury came before halftime.
“He came over to the out line and he just collapsed,” Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie the oxygen in the car before they put him on and took him to further interrogations.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that the Abercrombie had been transferred to the Medical Center Vanderbilt to be treated.
Harris added that "there's still no detail on the type/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessean is trying to find out when it's come to the injury.
Abercrombie, the red jersey of the second year, is currently in the first season with Tennessee after the Illinois transfer.
On Saturday, he had five defenses before he dropped the game, for he had a total of defenses in season 18.
We're going to be paying more to our customers than we've ever done for a tax stamp on real estate purchases in the U.K.

Fearful customers will be charged more for their tax stamps than for UK real estate purchases - and adequate income will be used to help homeless people, Tereza Mej said.
This time around, he's going to try to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in making it easier for young voters to vote, and he's going to try to make it more affordable for them.

It is estimated that 13 of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents of the UK, which raise prices and make it more difficult for people who buy first-hand to get to work.
Many wealthy parts of the country - especially the capitals - became "ghost towns" because of the large number of passionate shoppers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new regulation comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called in a change of pace to make it look like he was young enough to get to his first job.
He accused large construction companies of holding high-priced real estate companies so far as the country was concerned, but he did not use it and appealed to Prime Minister May to "take a stand on the issue".
Corbin has announced an impressive array of recent housing developments, including a cost-effective control and an unprecedented exodus.
He also wants to disavow the authority to build new homes.
Prime Minister May said: “I have said in the past that I will dedicate my Prime Minister’s term to the restoration of the British dream, so that life will be better for every new generation.
And that's what's been encouraging and solving the problem in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it can't be wrong for a purchase of real estate to be made only after it's easy for individuals who don't live in the UK and are a company as large as they are for working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too much while reducing homelessness has become too much of a reality."
Jack Ross: “My ambition is to lead Scotland.”
Sanderland boss Jack Ross says his "strange ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is currently in third place in the major leagues, three times from the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership League for the season.
“I want to play for my country like a football player.
I was on the B-team and that's it," Ross said of the BBC's "Sportssound" show.
“But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot, and I wanted to be little, and that was something I was always coming back to.
However, such an opportunity would be provided only if I am successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Mojiza, Sam Alerdais, Martin O'Neill, Roy China, Gus Pojeta, and Paola.
The former boss of Alois Athletics says he's not afraid to come after such big names in such a big club, after he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
“Merillo has succeeded in this moment, he will be in that moment ‘so that I can return this club to the Premier League’.
It is the structure and potential of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I think I’ll be able to make it work if I can get the club back where it belongs.”
Ross is in the third year of his managerial career, after the period he spent as assistant chief in Dumbarton and the 15 months he spent in Trensk.
That's why he helped Alois recover from falling into the third division, and St. Mirren came from the edge of the lower league to win the championship next.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroad,” he said, recalling the takeover of the Alois club.
“I really believed that management was the right thing for me, more of a game.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made a solid profit from it, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But the game knows to be tough.
There's a lot of things that you have to go through on a week's field.
And I'm still going through this in terms of stress and pressure, but my management is just responding.
I've always wanted to keep up with management and now I'm doing it, and I haven't felt more comfortable in my entire life."

The perfect time for the mug is 17.30 on Saturday, the research reveals.
The summer's heat wave was increasing for the British laborers who were fighting for their lives, but it was increasing the pressure on the restaurant chain.
In the group of pubs and bars there was a growth of 2.7 per cent in July - but the turnover in the restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin of the Consultancy Company of the Central African Republic, which has obtained the figures, says: “Several sunny days and longer expected participation of England in the World
After spending 1.8 hours in restaurants in June alone, it was further improved in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinking had the best effect with the greatest growth in the other area, and consistent results from the previous period were found in the following:
The crowds focused on the food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as the owners of the restaurant.
It seems people just wanted to get out for a drink.
The chains of labor and the bars increased to six and a half drinks a month, and three of them sold their food.
Paul Newman from the RSM Agency for Analysis of the Oblivion and Satisfaction says: “Such results are emerging from a trend that we can see from April.
The weather and the influence of the main social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to selling to the market outside the household.
It's no surprise that groups of restaurateurs are fighting a hard battle, even though they'll be selling out of 4.8 percent of the annual field by now.
It's been a long time since we've been able to get to the mountains." We're going to have to wait for the caterers to focus on the food, and we're going to see if they're going to give us more of the moderate temperature that we've got.
The total growth of sales in new buildings and restaurants, including new facilities, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, while maintaining the improvement in the introduction of new buildings.

Ailey Doyle will be the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Athletic Board
Eileen Doyle was elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board of Trustees as non-executive director of the annual General Session of that governing body.
Doyle is the most creative of the Scottish athletics and leadership of Ian Beatty has described this as an excellent opportunity for those who are in charge of the sport to take advantage of it.
"Aylie enjoys a great deal of respect for the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will have a huge benefit from her membership.
Doyle said, "I want to be a voice for athletics, and I'm hoping I can actually make a donation to help run the sport in Scotland."
The American who won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200- and 400-meter games in Atlanta in 1996, is now the world's first professional player.

Thank you for your encouragement!"
We're talking about a milk-milk pump in which the mother's blood is being spilled on the Internet.
The company that produces the pumps for the milking has shared the opinion of the interne with the one who provides the milking to the blood muse.
How would you characterize the launch of a product that is described as "the first silent pump for the milking that is carried out under the breast", the manufacturer of the product is the manufacturer of the product.
Four real moms dance to each other in a way that they don't notice, but it's not you, it's you, it's you.
He says, “Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump.”
However, the Facebook company’s publicized page has been challenged by internal controls.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he saw the different reactions of the viewers, while many said that he was diminishing the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“The use of blood for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and work to produce milk, but theirs has been delayed for a few days after birth," he wrote.
Pump for milking Elvie discreetly into the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But if they were, why wouldn't they use it to tell a pump for a mother who could keep her baby?"
Someone said, "That's a very thoughtless statement."
Others were on a side note, and one woman confessed that her song was “an emergency.”
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd like this one if I was still playing.
Because of the pump, I felt just like a bloodhound.
It's a bit of a joke, but I figured it out.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny phrase directed at moms who are milking milk (often at home or in the bathroom) and feel like they’re milking milk.
This is not a statement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
In the video, a group of women discover that they've all danced with discrete pumps hidden in their bras.
We're talking about the memory of a lot of mothers who are milking milk and saying that they feel like they're bleeding.
However, Elvie's pump is completely inconspicuous. It doesn't have wires or pipes, and it stays in the chest for the next couple of weeks, so as long as I'm willing to go for the rest of the day, it keeps its own baby, and sometimes
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother Company, commented: “The Elvie Pump is so much of a revolutionary product that it serves the needs and needs of our customers.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to Temporary Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the harsh rhetoric and policies the Trump administration has introduced to make it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
As usual, the sponsors themselves were mostly illegal immigrants without documents and they fear that they will jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country if they come forward and look for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, confirmed to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had signed up to sponsor minors without care.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who have been sponsors or members of sponsor households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminally prosecuted foreigners.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That's why we're still pursuing those people," Mr. Albens said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the shelter workers, in order to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most will use conference video instead of personal presence to apply for legal status to an immigration judge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Those found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in custody, the higher the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes, according to shelter workers and system reports over the past months.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Proponents say concerns about it have been raised in larger facilities such as Thornillo, where indications that a child is being tortured can be easily overlooked due to the size.
They add that moving children to a temporary settlement without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or forgive friends can cause traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria Tells U.S., French, Turkish ‘Occupational Forces’ to Withdraw Immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also urged refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be “required accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have fled their homeland.
He also said Damascus would continue to “lead its holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “the entire illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said there were satisfactory conditions for them to return, and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" of refugees staying out of the country.
“We have issued a call to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return,” he said.
"They're making politics out of something that should be purely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition that will end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a vacuum zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has led to the possibility of further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has drawn attention to the large-scale attack by Syrian forces that enjoy Russian support in the province of three million people.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the target of military actions would be jihadists along with fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which would be "eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition will be held soon with the aim of creating a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of that panel should be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.

Foreign money in the middle of a tense race for early elections in the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district receives inflows of money, thanks to the reshuffle of congressional districts resulting in two MPs fighting for the same seat each.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thus, recently, Connor Lamb, a Pittsburgh suburban district Democrat representative, was given a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lamb is in a race with another MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had unconstitutionally rigged the results of the election in favor of the Republicans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The race in the new 17th launched a bidding to fund campaigns between the party's top financiers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lamb was made famous in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed special March election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The seat was held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Political connoisseurs gave Trump a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, so it withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners moved out the management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. representatives of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Heather Noert, a spokeswoman for the department earlier this month, said in a statement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the penalties only applied to El Salvador which received US aid in 2017 in an estimated amount of $140 million, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The punitive measures, which include cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be difficult for a Central American country that already has a high unemployment and murder rate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to accompany a similar gathering last year that they considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and put an end to all questions about the penalization of Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would attend the conference, whose new term is mid-October, indicating the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal issues on condition that they remain anonymous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history
>>srp_Cyrl<< The next inevitable thing is likely to be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, of which there is now significant evidence in public sources.
Mueller is also reportedly launching an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in connection with the election attacks.
If Congress were to change hands, Trump would face accountability in that body, as he prepares to go before voters again, and possibly before a colleague’s court.
That's a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don't want to say that Trump's defeat is inevitable - nor is the defeat of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1938, German officers were ready to undertake a coup against Hitler, that the west was able to resist him and deter Czechoslovakia in Munich.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We failed at it, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the carnage that followed in the coming years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Americans now face several such turning points.
>>srp_Cyrl<< What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages the fate of Mueller's investigation?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosenstein has found himself in an unelected grapevine since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed that the president be secretly filmed and commented on his unfitness for office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosenstein says the Times statement is incorrect.
“How do we react when Brett Kavanaugh’s newly launched investigation into the FBI is neither complete nor fair, or if he gets approval from the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
>>srp_Cyrl<< And above all, are we going to vote in early elections for a Congress that Mr. Trump finds credible?
>>srp_Cyrl<< If we fail those exams, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
>>srp_Cyrl<< My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with the swastika.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Wien
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive tie with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would bring them a firm position for qualifying from Group G of the League of Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Graham Doran, a midfield player, due to a knee injury could not appear in the season until a 2-2 tie with Villarreal, but believes Rangers can use that score as a springboard for larger goals.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is in a better position," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game with the belief that we could win something, and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have got them in the end, but given everything, the even result is quite fair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They were probably better than us in the first half, but we came back in the second and took the lead.
Thursday is coming up and it will be another big night for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had an excellent result from the last game. Although, with the audience on our side, I am sure that we can stop and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, with everything that happened to me with injuries and changes in the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, the workouts are good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We hope that now we can shut down, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women worried about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, very few talked about it with families.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they had spoken to spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they’ve talked to kids about it.
“People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for providing care if you don’t introduce them to your wishes well in advance.
Together with the counselor and family, you decide where and how you want to get care because these are choices that greatly affect costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include your usual long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that includes money and value to cover expenses or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documentation: warn court disputes.
Get a health care assistant to have a reliable person you can trust to take care of your medical care and that health care professionals are aware of your wishes in case you are unable to self-state.
Also, consider giving authority to manage finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid on time if you are not capable of doing so.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your aging parent comes into a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide these details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about questions like who are the doctors?” asked Martina.
“What medications do they use?
Who will take care of the dog?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Have a plan ready for all of that."
Man shot repeatedly by air rifle in Ilfracom
>>srp_Cyrl<< The man was shot multiple times by an air rifle as he was returning home from the exit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The victim, a man in his forties, was in a part of Ilfracom in Devon called Oxford Grove, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as a "random act".
>>srp_Cyrl<< The victim did not see the attacker.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The injuries are not life-threatening, and police have asked witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 384 people have lost their lives in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, according to official sources.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to broken ties, emergency relief officials were unable to obtain information from the Dongale Regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
>>srp_Cyrl<< More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster struck.
Here are the most important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The city was in the midst of a 40th anniversary celebration at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dongala is a regency spanning more than 300 km (180 miles) along the shoreline of Sulawesi Island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regency, a lower-level administrative region than the province, had an estimated half-life of 299,200 people in 2017.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The economy of North Sulawesi province relies mostly on fishing and livestock, especially in the coastal area of Dongale.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in the Morovali area, on the opposite coast of Sulevasi Island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Palu and Dongala have experienced multiple tsunami impacts in the last 100 years, according to records from Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the 1938 Dongala tsunami more than 200 people lost their lives, and thousands of houses were destroyed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The tsunami struck western Dongala again in 1996 when it claimed nine victims.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific and is a regular target of the earthquake.
These are the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2004: A major earthquake that struck the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, which is more than half the population of Aceh.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people lost their lives on the island of Nias opposite the coast of Sumatra.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that crashed on the south coast and claimed almost 700 lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Zaparna Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra and triggered a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2016: A minor earthquake struck the Pidijay Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic because it reminded people of the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people lost their lives in collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily without a residence.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on harassment charges.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, twenty-nine-year-old Palin from Vasile, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged offences, he took her phone away.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Palin was held in custody in Matsu and was given a $500 bail, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he appeared in court where he said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked, the network reported.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could receive a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is also charged with a Class B offense that is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The case is currently in court for Alaska veterans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSP) that had arisen due to warfare in Iraq.
Tsunami Caused by Indonesia Earthquake: Hundreds Dead
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 384 people have died after an earthquake occurred on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake struck only central Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are videos circulating on social networks depicting the moment of impact.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami crashed ashore.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October and mow pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in New York’s southern district.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the court document, both counts carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 indictments against Saipov that included eight charges of murder plus racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov performed it as "detestable, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibulaevitz Saipov caused injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lor Dikat, Deren Drake, Ariel Erlius, Herna Ferrucci, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Panuccio,” the statement reads.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It has been ten years since the southern district of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to court documents, Saipov who is originally from Uzbekistan did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
The indictment alleges that Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS on his phone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police said he had requested and that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He pleaded not guilty to the 22-point charge.
David Petton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Petton said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Saip's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party’s parliament says that Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should face euroscepticism - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a gathering in Birmingham that the UK would have “already come out” by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her divided ranks is underscored by the views of the Conservatives, who are in favour of staying and joining a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to follow a compromise Chequers plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insist on continuing their attempts to reach a deal with Brussels despite the reaction - and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offer and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihall that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
>>srp_Cyrl<< He suggested that Mr Farage should become equal and receive responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If I was responsible, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Velinboro added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers.”
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative MP and Brexit supporter, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually taking to the streets and putting us first.
Let the Chequers go and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage told the crowd that politicians must face problems if they decide to issue a decision that was made in a 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to issue a Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them get away with it.”
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to issuing Brexit, to feel the oncoming tide.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that won Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, supporters of the remainder walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Many activists waved at the “Conservatives Against Brexit” banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lord Adonis, Labour leader, mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they had with the party's application since the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can put in IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus solution, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.”
Good Brexit, it doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider entering the race for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider getting into the race for president" after the November election.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall in western Massachusetts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Deell, a Republican party representative, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is speculated that Warren may replace Trump in 2020.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded: “It’s time for women to go to Washington to recover a shaky government, and that means a woman at the top.”
Suspect who shot Sims, LSU player arrested
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested who had shot and killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 pm ET at a conference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They released video shootings on Friday and sought help in identifying the man seen in the video.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simms, 20, was killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head and died instantly,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, said via 247sports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wade stood up for his friend and Simpson shot him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present, that he owned a weapon, and that he had killed Wade Sims.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A 198.12 cm junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team concedes him victory over Sebastian Fetel
>>srp_Cyrl<< From the moment Valterius Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes' team would play a major role in this race.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Fetel to attack his colleague.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to run into the crowd at the end of the tape, which was to be decisive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mercedes left later and came out ahead of Fettel, but Hamilton overtook after riding a wheel-by-wheel which left Ferrari's driver reluctantly in danger of retiring after a double movement for the defense on the third turn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Max Fairstappen started from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then led in most of the race to score a quick finish and take over Kimi Raikonen's fourth place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He went into boxing in the 44th lap, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps so Raikkonen remained in fourth place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is a tough day because Valtteri has been driving great all weekend and like a real gentleman he missed me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The team did a great job winning the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was bad body language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not released a letter from Christine Blaze Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, impertinent, and dishonest.”
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, rude and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make that public?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I'm not."
Well, wait a minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did we publish it...No, we didn't," he added talking about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September. Feinstein dismissed the claim that information had been leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusation, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep the story confidential and I kept her as confidential as she asked.”
But her denial didn’t seem to appeal to the president, who commented during Saturday night’s rally: “You know what, that was really bad body language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats were using those accusations for their own ends.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You see evil, grossness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite relayed the president's statement.

Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds on plane from quake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been declared a hero after allowing a plane carrying hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Strong blows continue to shake this area and many are trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower that collapsed Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then jumped off the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He died later in hospital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sire, said the decision Antonis made may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still under rubble, while many cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nagroho, a spokesman for the agency.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Waves reaching up to six meters destroyed the Pala where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “At any moment, the ambulance is bringing bodies.
There is no clean water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the state army: “I ask you to work around the clock to complete all the tasks related to the rescue.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crashes into lagoon
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airliner operating the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person has gone missing, having previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Air Niugini said it could not find one passenger, a man, as of Saturday afternoon.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in order to find passengers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more passenger details such as age or nationality.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline and the Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon that is close to the runway.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some witnesses think the plane missed the runway.
>>srp_Cyrl<< US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Janes said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Janes said that he and others were able to make their way through the water to the waist to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said that the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he had a minor head injury.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the pier also helped salvage by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 feet below water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in the crashes of PNG-registered airliners over the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.

>>srp_Cyrl<< United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He stated for the jury how he used cell phone records to merge the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Raulette said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous claims.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the data showed that his mobile phone was with a mobile phone belonging to Chambers during a time period when he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, the police went to talk to Senford.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sanford came to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Senford's truck that night, Senford said he was "lying because the truck was in Nashville."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another discrepancy is that Tellis said that he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other for seven days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defense should deliver its final word on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The judge said he expected the trial to continue during that day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The High Breed: What is hip hop that raises consciousness?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots - political messages and social issues solving.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They want to return to their roots and restore the popularity of social-political hip hop.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Performers such as Fujiz and Common have again become current in the UK thanks to performers such as Akala and Louki.

Nanny in New York sues couple for firing after 'racist' message
A nanny in New York City sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after she received a text message from her mother by mistake complaining that the nanny was “another black person.”
The couple deny that they are racists and identify the lawsuit with “extortion.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that the new childcare provider, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOT ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms Plasko-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their current nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing a good job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs. Morris was paid one day's work, and was then invited by Uber to take her home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month job he was originally supposed to do living in their house, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple rejected claims that they were racists and said that severing Morris's employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to have confidence in her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent something she didn’t plan on saying.
She's not a racist.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We are not racists." husband Joel Plasco told the Post magazine.
But why would you give your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Oh come on, please."
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone like that?
>>srp_Cyrl<< That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly disowned this couple on social networks and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In a just-discovered letter, we learn that the publishers of the Paddington books were afraid that readers would not attach themselves to the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's very fun now to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before a teddy bear inspired him to write this children's book, would have been optimistic even if his work had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "simultaneously bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” said her father was discreetly proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man and didn’t brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt like when people had a child who accomplished something: they were proud of him even though they didn’t actually do anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think that's how Paddington's success was viewed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Ned regularly called to say that the condition was very bad, that he did not expect to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperus said.
“Then I received a call from Ned telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The action of the drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly ceased and the drugs left her system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She died some time before that and this was actually a shutdown of the entire system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I just had to sit and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I had to hold on."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, in mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside other passengers who did not know what hell she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I bowed my head and tears flowed down my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but over the summer, I felt immense compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning set up suicide prevention cards on bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a chef with great potential and an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They always said his smile lit up the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because “it was getting dark.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by his brother who was 11 years old at the time.
Ms Davis said: “I am constantly worried that there will be some consequences.”
Ms Davis made the cards “to let people know that there are people you can talk to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be silent - you need to talk to someone."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He touched the bottom on Christmas Day - when the children were opening presents, he was neither looking them in the eyes nor anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to deal with it: “It leads to discord in the family.
He's ruining us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we really got something similar to what he was asking for - an investigation with limited time and limited scope - maybe we could come to some sort of agreement," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "disintegrating" amid tight party pressure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their opposition came about because of the timing.
Since the midterm elections, we are only five weeks away, they are held on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans go bad, they will be greatly weakened in attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< George W. Bush continuously calls on the Senators and lobbies with them to provide support to Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republican Party representatives and 49 Democratic Party representatives.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn the decision and send it to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'fallen' under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors fleeing to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Citing data from the Unification Ministry in South Korea, Park Byong-seg said there were 1127 defections last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr Park said tighter controls on the borders between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most have defected via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross into it due to the extremely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at postponing negotiations over denuclearization.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work toward the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and in such conditions, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', says he's not fit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nominee "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi stated this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribunal Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help feeling that if a woman ever behaved like that, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were teenagers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the opening exposure, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his throat tightened as he talked about his family and his high school years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on personality" organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was seen to be prejudiced against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pelosi hesitated to provide an answer when asked if she would try to take Kavanaugh to court if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn’t be in the Supreme Court, he should be in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade Act because he is considered a conservative judge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During a subsequent hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And women should be proud of that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's a justified criticism, months and years of overwhelming anger and she can't get it out of her system without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s a rare occurrence, is it?”
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive at a company and who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique that implied that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would say, 'Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm angry.'
And then she would just go on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That sounded great to me too."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tears are allowed as a vent for anger in part because people basically don't understand them.
One of my strongest memories is when I was at a previous job in an office where there were mostly men crying once out of indescribable rage and an elderly woman, a cold manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They'll think you're sad and they'll be glad they hit you like that."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital love affair on a boat called "The Monkey Business" and dropped out of the race, a deeply frustrated Miss Schroeder realized that there was no reason why she herself should not try her hand at running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Someone called it ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'."
As the campaign progressed, she was short on funds, so she swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That battle was doomed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave a speech in which she said she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult for target voters to raise money instead of delegates, and anger over sexism - that she had her throat tightened.
“One would think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled in reference to the way the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex would be my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my headstone?
>>srp_Cyrl<< ‘She cried'?"
How a trade war between the U.S. and China could be good for Beijing
The initial shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is nowhere near over, the gap between the countries may be suitable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP) effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beijing has retaliated each time, and last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on 60 billion USD of US goods.
China has pledged to return to the U.S. in the same measure, and it doesn’t seem like the world’s second-largest economy will change its mind any time soon.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it needs to bow to its demands, and public acceptance of U.S. conditions would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of a trade war with the U.S. could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic upheaval to begin in either country is actually much more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugee return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding countries destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Al-Muallem said the regime in Syria would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financially supported the insurgency.
Europe takes another victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
>>srp_Cyrl<< European Type won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field near Paris in France.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The United States suffered a sixth consecutive defeat on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Europe won the victory again by having a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn win the 14.5 points he needed to beat the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during most of the tournament, threw the ball with a shot from that into the water on a par-3 shot at the 16th hole, thus handing the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and has become one of four players to ever win 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
>>srp_Cyrl<< American Jordan Spit was outscored 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, was beaten 2 and 1 by Ian Polter of England, to whom this may be the last Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A veteran who played in eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European with the most wins in tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This has been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The team is the most important thing and I am happy that I could help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He passed a torch to his countryman John Ram who beat American golf legend, Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I feel incredible pride that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Ram.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a career-high 13-21-3 points at the Ryder Cup.
Odd statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to make good moves, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented on his team’s disappointing game: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we almost reached Europe.
We tried.
Every bit of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We will regroup, I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have to bow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We're outplayed."
Red tide news: Concentration declines in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota counties
>>srp_Cyrl<< The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Protection Committee shows a general decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the Committee, conditions of more colorful flowering have been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliery - indicating reduced concentration.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The blooming red tide extends for approximately 210 kilometers of coastline from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
Stains can be found about 16 kilometers off the coast in Hillsboro County, but in fewer places than last week.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mean concentration on the coast or from the coast of Pinellas County was reported last week, from the coast in Hillsboro County low to high concentration, in Manati County back to high concentration, on the coast or from the coast of Sarasota County back to high concentration, in Charlotte County back to low concentration, on the coast or from the coast of Lila
>>srp_Cyrl<< Respiratory organ irritation is still reported in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Respiratory organ irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
