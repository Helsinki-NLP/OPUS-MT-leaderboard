Wells’s Assembly members worry that “they look like muppets, ”
Part of the Assembly members have been deceived by the proposal to change their title to the ‘CUP’ (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Wells Parliament.
Members of the entire political spectrum worry that this may become a cause for ridicule.
One of the Leiberists said that his group was worried that the new name \"drumped with Tup and Wdlub\"
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group “is not happy ” and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group was not preconceived to change the name, but noted that the new term CHR (in English – MWP) has a certain Slovenian opportunity with a \"muppet\"
In this context, the word ‘W’ shall be expressed in a similar sense to that of the letter ‘U’ in English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft draft draft draft by changing the name, made the following statement: “It is understood that the final decision on all the descriptional references to which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves,
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry on the proposals, which established a broad support for the Assembly to start calling it ‘Wels Parliament’,
As far as the office of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers ‘the Members of the Wells Parliament’, in short-term ‘CUP’ but the ‘CUP’ option has received the greatest support after an inquiry into society.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft draft draft draft draft for a few weeks.
The reforming bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the Commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia,
The referendum has been planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called ‘Macedonia’,
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposition to the referendum on the change of name of the state, said he would not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Chambers, behind the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
\"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to there was a bar and church literally at every corner, Mr Adams shares.
\"Today both are gone.
Adams says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
\"People today are socialised in different ways, he added.
“Bars are no longer the quarterly daily, where everyone gathers regularly,
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later will be in the same situation,
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments, where people who do not help survive other sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
\"The huge majority of people buying housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the new settlers will visit them,
Both churches were built by white flocks before Harlem became a quarter of the blacks – the Metropolis community in 1870 and “St. Martin – a decade later.
The original White Methodist Society was out in the years since 1930.
Then the building became owned by black people in the neighborhood.
\"St. Martin was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organised a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black workers.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's enories had put together a plan for its restoration, and they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and heir of St. Martin, proudly called them “the poor bells, ”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: ‘Cultural treasure – and ‘unreplaceable historical instrument’
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather mentions that St. Martin's has never been replaced.
What has been played in St. Martin’s, during the last few weeks, has been a complex tale made by architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
Of the news - which is the governing authority of the congregation, consisting of world leaders - they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be willing to transfer the expenses of the news – although it had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old kid was injured by a shark hunting for lobsters in California.
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative authorities reported.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beakon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamal told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends about half an hour ago when he overheard the boy screaming for help and went in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamal first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then realized how to scream “Haw me! ”
He bit me.
Hamal says that when he got to the boy, he found out that the whole area of his clavicle was torn apart.
\"I called everyone out of the water because there is a shark, \" added Hamle.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
He's not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior Captain Larry Giles has pronounced a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not of a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of her body.
The responsible authorities have closed the access to the Ponto Beach coastline in Casablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours from safety considerations until the investigation is under way.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them do not pose a danger to humans.
Saintsbury plans an offensive of the great British market for ornamental products
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening up the beauty stands in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of a significant market offensive for beauty products in the UK, estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, the largest, up to now, beauty stands will be located in 11 stores across the country, then, when the initiative is successful, they will be found in more objects.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is done at a time when supermarkets look for ways to use the free space on the mats, until recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said they would double the number of products available to up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space similar to those of Boots' stores.
The supermarket also re-enacts its boutique gamma make-up so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly wanted by younger consumers.
In addition, the merchant of the Fragrance Shop perfumes will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which you opened in Croyden, South London last week, while the second one will be discovered in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the shifting focus on buying smaller amounts of food every day in convenient moments leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Koup, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that the sites would look more and more like universal shops, while the supermarkets chain is trying to deal with the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have the objects of Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as the objects of Habitats since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims to have increased the sale of food and has made the profits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to re-fass its facilities for beauty and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute to distribute profits from the sites of the pharmaceutical company in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with 281 celesio, who owned Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there, they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the species and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The proposed gamma brand aims to respond to every flavor and all the necessary in a predatory setting with a comfortable location, making us an attractive destination for beauty products, which challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones, furious, after Holly Wilby's refusal of an 11 million-pound deal
Dragons Dan Peter Jones “has become angry, after TV’s leading Holly Willable has given up a deal for 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilby has no time for the brand household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared with the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of \"This morning\" announced her leaving in Instagram.
Holly Wilbey left the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones “to take a look at it, having withdrawn from their income business with the last minute Lifestyle Products brand – and focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones “became angry, when “the golden girl ” confessed to television during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckingham, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will no longer be time for his household product brand and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow, and rumors are that he has doubled the Willbby wealth, whose value is forecasted at 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Wilbey announced on Instagram her leaving of Truly, Jones left Britain on a plane to head for one of her holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be a long-term commitment to ensure its future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the brewing completely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters that's full of waiting to be sold products,
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading one of the morning, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a slowdown in the marketing of the brand.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, who mothered her to three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Kappa, for ten years.
Willby herself founded Truly together with Kappa in 2016, like Jones, who was 52, joined as chairman of the company in March.
Both families often take vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Wilbby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will also replace Anne McParlin as the lead of the show \"I am a celebrity – on ITV.
Last night, the Source, close to Jones, made the following statement: “We will not comment on his business affairs,
Hard negotiations leading to \"stopping relations\"
He joked about the criticisms he would take from the news channels to make comments that someone would consider \"unsuitable to the President\" and as too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his funny - language way.
\"I didn't give up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as “a major step towards eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons,”
But negotiations to remove this weapon are being held back.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea top diplomat Ri Jung Ho told representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea “does not see a reciprocal attitude, on the part of the United States, towards its country’s first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
\"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful,\" he noted.
\"We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people were about to die.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship,
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results -- termination of rocket tests, release of hostages, and return to the home of US military bodies.
He also defended his neurodoxic approach to the negotiations with Kim.
\"It is extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 right there – Trump said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake of foreign NGOs, it was said that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not declared, requiring international aid to be initiated.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases it is said that there is no international aid, which makes things slightly challenging, says Mrs Sumbung.
While “Save the Children, ” I am putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in the case of tsunamis in Acheh, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the multiple Indonesian islands poses a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate even more this logistics.
Recently stationed in Lombok for services the victims of the earthquake hospital ship has headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days before he can reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia's remaining infrastructure into the centre of its campaign, investing a great deal of resources in roads and railway lines.
But lack of finances are constantly harassing his cabinet while Joko's moving out of the urns again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought the streets with swords, bows, and arrows, as well as other original weapons.

The death toll since the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia grew to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memory hit by \"recording history\"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
Al-Cromwell’s Society described Mr. Creek’s proposal as “sense and” an attempt to rewrite the story,
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove statues of Oliver Cromwell’s to the Palace of Amsterdam to become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent presentation of Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to defend parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person representing one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve his name and honor.
A pig killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near the cost of the Liepanshui market in Guajzhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The hog was preparing to inject with vaccines of its pigs in Sinin in Cinhai Province, China in 30 May 2005.
He is supposed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the neighboring herd open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody zurla in the joint.
The forensic expertise has confirmed that 550-fun pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reported.
\"My cousin's feet were bloodied and debilitated, said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guyyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Juan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The life killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evaning News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and market management negotiate for compensation for the death.
Although it's rare, it's been reported before about pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig was attacked by a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, when the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years before that, a 650-fun pig impaled a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood could affect them as a trigger.
\"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one should treat them with respect, the man ends up with respect.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and shedding rains in the southwest U.S.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will lead to flood rains in northern Mexico and southwest parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. on Sunday, east time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a synclin is being formed, which is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start to push the tropical moisture deep into the north to the southwest part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in certain areas of Mexico.
In the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synchronous will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carried debris streams and likely rainfalls in the desert.
The deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It will be extremely unwise to walk a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to rising dust and pushy winds.
The approaching synclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts along the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach a rainfall of more than half an inch, leading to a number of small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
On Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rains will start approaching Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics stay warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's a nearly 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to rise and expand.
In most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start on October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast points to a high probability of temperatures above average in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six TV networks the attractive maturity of the testimony of the Supreme Court nominations Brett Kavanau and Christine Blassie Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During that time, political opposition continued by interrupting their regular reverse programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement settled by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was convinced of 100% that Kavanaugh had drunkly pressed her and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his devoid of emotion, is absolutely adamant that such a thing never happened.
It is likely even more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen to have watched the testimony Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate available data on other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally experienced difficulties in measuring the number of people who are watching from their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about an audience similar to the size of this championship football match or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-time hearing reported by Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3,26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's play.
After the moderate Republican's office came out with a statement that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS's cameras filmed on Friday as they whistled the protestors as he tried to catch the elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes he did not lift his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
\"I am right here, standing before you, said a woman.
“Do you think he presents the truth to the State?
\"You have power, while many women are completely helpless, the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his cabinet had already come out with a declaration and before the elevator doors were closed, he said it would be further spoken during the hearing by the committee.
Cables and broadcast networks provided a live coverage several hours later when the Court committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the attention of the full Senate vote.
Ali Flake said he would only do this if he was confident that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, which the Democrats insist on in opposition.
Flake was partially convinced of his conversation with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party Chris Queens.
After talking to Queens and a few senators, Fleck made his decision.
Its choice was of particular importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the Cavanaugh charges.
Britain's Prime Minister May blames critics in political games, with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in \"political games\" with the future of Britain and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called \"The Lady's Plan – for Brexit, speaking of a proposal that the collection of customs fees from Britain to the EU and vice versa is totally absurd,
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the final fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and sentenced to second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department reported.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, saying that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The cops found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported from CBS WAFB's branch.
After Simpson's interview, the police announced that he confessed to the fatal shot against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
The Department of Judicial Medicine of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, indicating a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The government expressed its gratitude to the refugee search department for Louisiana state police, the police crime lab, the police of Southern University and local residents for the assistance they had provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU Director of athletic sports Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement authorities for “temporary justice”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average during the last season he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU Will Wade announced that the team was a wreck - and - a shock - after Wade's death.
Wade said that \"this is something that worries a person all the time\"
The Vulcan spreads ashes over Mexico City
Throwing out of the volcano Popotetepetel ash reached southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexican citizens Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ash discards have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed multiple tremors and tremors.
Posted in social media photos show a thin layer of dust covering the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital, since an earthquake with a magnetic 7.1 shakes central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in contact with Catalun separatist separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protestors of independence met with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to resent the guardians of peace with eggs and paint dust, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crawling with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other matches with the police, as the police resorted to their bats to control the situation.
Over the course of hours supporting independence, the groups have been shouting, \"We do not forget, we do not forgive, until the country's declared integrity has been retaliashed with \"Spain forever,\"
The local press reported that, as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desirable independence of the region even a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatists who are in a separatist mood.
The huge majority voted on their vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalun authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in voting sections in the region with a number of stormy clashes.
Wanted independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to pass on a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds back hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
\"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be stuck, the man added.
Despite the important victory, whether by little difference, in the regional elections in the last December, the supporters of Catalonia political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either self-involved, or are arrested for awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on his phone to support the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians both sides.
His comment is that \"it's getting more and more intense.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine arrested Catholic leaders awaiting a preliminary process last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
He argues that \"my candidacy for European elections is the best way to resist the repression of democratic values and repressions that we are seeing by the Spanish government,
Londonderi: Arrested Men After Car Boxed in a House · Global Voices
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car crashed several times in a Londonderi house.

Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the game.
The money in the High League Livingston surprised the Rangers and caused only a second loss to Stephen Gerard in his first 18 matches as the manager of the Club of Aybrox.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's team came up with the second in the Hibernian ranking.
Gerard's team remains unbeatable in a foreign field in the High League during this season, and the following Sunday it stands up to leader Harts, who is left with eight points in ranking.
But before that, Rangers is hosting Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has already been in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and Manager Holt has not yet experienced the taste of loss since changing his post at Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the wireless guests.
The Holt team had to lead the score far before score, and its direct style of game extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson got a defense, but his shot went sideways, and then Alan Litgow shot right past the beam after Craig Halkett brought the ball back with his head to it.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously trouble the guests from static positions.
And that's exactly how you got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, like Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and brought Menga out who led the ball and scored from the middle of the criminal field.
Until now, the Rangers ruled the ball more, but they faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and the doorman Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This style of game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and a blow to Littlelow's head passed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's criminal field, however, the centre was down, which was easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for a trap – first after the one-carrying between Halket and Glenn Middleton's reserve, and then in doubt of playing hand.
“Fenomental – Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to ‘Tony Macaroni Arena’
Awesome game and great score for Livingston.
The team plays just excellent, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not change after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserved much praise for the way the team converted after its appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a wonderful way, while Menga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warrel under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing of inspiration.
Under Gerard's guidance, they demonstrated some great things, but they were very much under these standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, and only once they were able to tear apart the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's contradictory visit to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
Friendly relations have cooled down due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU admission.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25-thousand-dollar crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were also raised by Kurds, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it into the country.
Various protests reflect a break caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is also despised as a despot by others.
A road crash in Deptford: Koljezdac rests after a car collision

The disaster occurs a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a escaped Childers Street driver, located nearly a mile from the Saturday crash site.
The local police have announced that their employees are working on identifying the man, and then they will inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are off, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Lung Lattin Prison: Six monitors are injured in turmoil
Six prison officers were injured in a high-level prison riot by the Prison Office.
The match broke out at Long Lattin Prison in Worcester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
For the purpose of its control, special officers from the Tordano squad are called in, who will have to deal with eight released persons, while the very interference is limited to one wing of prison.
The injured supervisors suffered minor injuries on the subjects and received medical attention on site.
A spokeswoman at the Prison Office made the following statement: “A specially trained staff have been called to deal with the resulting incident in Long Latin Prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we state very clearly that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, and it is possible that their sentences may be extended,
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Latin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack by a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October of last year, police officers from the riot forces were called to prison, where they could master a major riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood off Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (even though the dried areas may benefit)
Rarely, Arizona is struck by a tropical storm, but there is a good chance that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert of the southwest, leading to a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already established positions against flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, with rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “up to the year 1950 only ten tropical cycles had maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!!
Katrina (1967) was stormed within 40 miles of the Arizona border,
The latest models from the National Center of Hurricanes provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Scalists Mountains and the Great Pool, will probably get 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of overlaps possible in separate places.
For those not threatened by flash floods, the rain caused by Rose may actually be a blessing, since the region is heavily affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain will probably be useful as the southwest part is currently in drought.
According to the Commission for the monitoring of the drought periods of the United States, a little over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second weight category, reported byweather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to land at the Baha California peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is located 385 miles from Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters over the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land in Mexico with the power of tropical storms Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of the latter.
“A total rain is expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches of rain available fromweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning as tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until Tuesday late evening.
\"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the US Desert Southwest, warning from the National Centre for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and bring different waste streams to the deserts, as well as receding in mountain terrains.
Midsamer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old kid was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in Excelsior Terrace on Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It's located in a hospital where his condition remains \"solid.\"
At night in the Radstock area were arrested a 17-year-old boy, two boys, 18 and a 20-year-old man, reported by the police in Aven and Somerset.
The cops are asking everyone who may have taken pictures of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump Says Cavanaugh \"Impulse and Rage of Democratic Party\" · Global Voices
\"Every vote for Judge Kavanau is a vote that rejects the corrupt and humiliating tactics of the democratic party, \"an announcement by Trump at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh was \"scared by the contempt and anger of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday by firmly rejecting Christine Blassie Ford's charges of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that “today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, the courage, and the qualities of Kavanaugh.
\"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true legal man with a beautiful reputation in the service of the public,\" the president told the gathered crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly noted Kavanau's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican votes for the general elections.
\"They leave five weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I am involved, Trump continued.
\"I am therefore going around and fighting to support the good candidates,
Trump noted that the Democrats had set themselves up for a mission \"to prevent and hinder
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanau is expected to take place no later than Friday, as reported by CNN by one of the co-workers of a senior representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken off the coast by giant waves when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at night the coast was swept by waves of up to six meters (18 feet), taking many to their death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami went off after an earthquake with a 7.5 Magnetic.
\"When the threat of tsunamis rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, which is why many became the victim of the disaster, said during a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesia BNPB disaster resolution agency.
\"The water was pulled by cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything on its way, continued Nugroho and added that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water, ” he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the agency of disaster photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, broken down and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosque.
Secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city during the Saturday day.
A number of earthquakes were felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) of Indonesia came out with a declaration that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the one released on a Hiroshima atomic bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “huges ” and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found below the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast of 300 km (190m) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is located closer to the truse epicenter.
He also added that “communications are completely cut and there is no information from Donggala –
The red cross in turn indicated that more than 300 000 people live there, adding that his teams and volunteers have already headed for the affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult,
On Saturday, the agency was publicly criticised for not informing about the defeat of Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Shared in social networks love videos show a man on the top floor of a building screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the coast and affects both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to authenticate the video in due time.
The earthquake and the tsunami have led to a severe power supply interruption, which has stopped communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other first-needed products.
The city airport was open only again for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The deceased in the Indonesia tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the employees of the World Vision of Donggala managed to safely reach Palu, where they found shelter in the Breznet soles, crucified in the courtyard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of destruction, says Mr. Dosseba.
\"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses,
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the ongoing rescue and recovery operations of emergency groups, some complain that the rich experience of such situations prevents foreign lifeguards from reaching Palu.
Under the Indonesian regulations, funding, sending personnel and supplies abroad can only be started if the affected site is declared a zone of national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
\"The poverty is still on a regional level,\" said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"After the government announced that this was a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such status,
As the second night of the Friday earthquake and the tsunami over Palu falls over, the friends and families of those who are still in ignorance continue to be miraculous and that their loved ones somehow survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paraplanerism team of Indonesia, has trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
\"As senior in the field of paraplanerism, I carry my own emotional burden,\" he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roja-Roja Hotel, it reached the paraplanetism community, he desperately sent messages to WatsApp to the racers in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
\"I think this means that the messages are not delivered – he added.
Thieves raise $26 750 during an ATM charge in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26 750 from a Bink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport's Levi, became clear by a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to charge it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.

Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, continuing the message, but the police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
All who have information on the suspect's identity must contact Newport Police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper, Kaniere West, has changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West,
West, 41, for a while wore the nickname Ye and used it as a title for its eighth album, which was published in June.
The change precedes its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande in the show that refused “for emotional reasons, ” reports the creator of the show.
In addition to the reduction of his current professional name, West had previously claimed that the word had religious meaning for him.
“I believe that “he” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means “you, ” or“ you,” said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the radio’s Big Boy.
\"This is how I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one man, simply a Ye, who is a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of our essence.
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the pseudonyms Love and Bradder Love.
One of the previous associates of West, J.Z., was also presented in an option with or without a track and/or main letters in its nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians
Newly-elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador swore he would never use military force. This happened until the country approached the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people, ”
The soldiers fired against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador gave the oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to the students and discover more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double the financing of IT development
At a time when China is becoming more and more active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States needs to double its research budget in this area, claimed researchers and developer of II Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government officials made comments on the issue of the I.I., although the United States as a whole does not have an official strategy for the I.I.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 in addition to innovation in the I.I. by 2030.
\"The doubling of the budget for the development of the II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs with regard to the II, said Lee.
Doubleting the funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of II coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “II Supersils: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest companies – Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melen Lee University he worked on an I.I. system that beat the most successful player on a suit in America, then he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee owed the debt of previous technological competitions to the federal government, such as the robotics competition of the Agency for Advanced Research Projects on Defence, and asked when the next one will be, which will help to identify the new visionaries.
\"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government funding, specifically Lee.
\"Not China takes over academic leaders, but corporations – the man claims.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on the I.I.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States step up its I.I. programme.
“I believe that the doctors in I.I. science should automatically be offered green cards, the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, notes Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in industry and academic environments, and the White House has announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, more than 100 million dollars a year is currently invested in the development of the II.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislative authority, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not marked any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
Citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state should change to \"the Republic of Northern Macedonia\" -- a move that would have resolved a decades-long dispute with Greece, blocking Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, therefore vetoing its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalistly-set opponents said the change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote alone in the referendum, while the boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubt as to whether the referendum will reach the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of his validity.
The question of the bulletins is: \"Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece,
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formation after the break-up of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
\"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us – said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have a binding force, enough members of parliament have ruled that they will comply with the result of it to the extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the urns.
\"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,\" said Gjosse Tanevski, a 62-year-old Skopje capital citizen.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in Macedonia's referendum to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for NATO and European Union accession in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kawadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents, which were stretched by the boycotting referendum.
\"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' door,\" Kawadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they won't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union,
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is over 20 per cent.
\"I believe that the huge majority will be with us, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO – Zaev said after it cast its own vote.
The government also said that the positive result would lead to \"confirming the future of our people\"
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum -- which is under the necessary activity.
Another survey, the case of Macedonian TV Telma, announced that 57% of the responders are planning to vote Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote \"Yes\"
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the entire Brighton defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his 65th-minute goal seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentinan Golmeister was found with a belt in the middle of the field.
He outruns three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the rest at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he passed left onto Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball to Aguero, who with a right-legged blow over Brighton's gatekeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right-hand corner of his door.
\"Aguero is struggling with some leg injuries,\" City Pep Guardola's manager told reporters.
\"We planned he to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal right at this very moment,
But Sterling was the one who provided the original advance of “the sons of heaven ” in this match of the Supreme League of England.
He got off the phone in 29 minutes.
In the situation of naked Aguero got a pass deep in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately put out his left flank pass to Leroy Sane.
Dream advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a belt of the distant beam.
The attacker of “the sons of heaven ” was able to detect at close range, just before the ball went out.
Siti will face Hoffenheim in the championship league group phase at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
The Chercer wants to play the fate of the Rockies
Once the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no particular point in another game of a title-winning starter.
Yet always the ambitious Shercer hopes to be a holder Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the game is important to the Rockies who lead a match in Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of the NL West.
The Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Card, the match after a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is not yet certain that they will win their first division title.
\"Despite that we ourselves do not fight for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a game like this?
Nationals haven't announced a starter for Sunday, but they're supposed to allow Shercer to participate if the game is crucial.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a starter this year, having practice on Thursday and having normal holiday time until Sunday.
The right-hand pitcher of Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 inning during this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president was fond of the situation with his elected Supreme Court officer Brett Kavanau, as he talked about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
\"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history - I also say that although I am not a candidate, I am actually participating in, that is why I am fighting all the forces for the right candidates, Trump said.
Afterwards you continued with “You all see this terrible, terrifying, radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourselves witness their integrity, their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run over to get into power and government, because they're only interested in power and governance, but we won't give them away.
The Democrats, according to the president, have set a goal to “interrupt and hinder ”
\"Which we have all seen in the last four days, \"he continued to call the Democrats \"wrestling, nasty, sneaky, and unfaithful,
The president reminded the Senate Court committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein in a clever way, which caused the crowd's loudly whistled.
\"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the documents?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I've been waiting -- that was really bad gistomac -- maybe the worst I've ever seen --
The Leiberists are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When the activists of the Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of Parliament for the Labours to whom it was stated that it was not welcome – only because I speak frankly.
My post in the parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude, as he firmly faced anti-semitism.
In my case, censorship criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
As regards the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics which are ironicly similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement during the previous leaders.
The notice of the meeting of the Leiberists of Nottingham East on Friday said that “We wish the meetings would include everyone and be productive,
In most of my eight years as the local representative of Labour in Parliament, Friday's meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most of the meetings and promises of “slight and moderate, ” politics have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda.
It was increasingly apparent that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of how much the party's leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had previously considered to share similar political views began to expect me to make a reverse turn and take positions that I would never agree with - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I make public speeches – no matter what I really say – there is a whole insulting tirade in social networks, where it calls for response, rejection of moderate policy, saying that I do not belong to the Leiberists.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I have even made better luck than some of my colleagues, because at least the comments about me are mostly political.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues, who face sexist or racist furniture every day without fear of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that the party is no longer wide open, with any sign of mistrust or change of the rules of choice becoming more narrower and more narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a number of counsel to be meek, not to speak so much, and then “all will be well. ”
But that's not why I joined politics.
Since I joined the Leiberists 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Tacher government, which, through my neglect, led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local adviser or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one at Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state seeks Brexit, it will harm the households, the companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and my energy in loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Leiberists, or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of response or political reprieve will fail me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Eer 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led to the ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final score, but there is no doubt that Eer deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of the Supreme League of Tennent.
The team already heads up the ranking and the only ten teams are without losing so far.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match by which coach Peter Murci and his team can be very satisfied.
“I’m happy because the other teams tested us very seriously in the past games, and we’re still broke,” Marcy noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations for Air have really taken advantage of their situation better than we have,
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow to Frazier Klimo, carried Eer forward as a result, but yellow chart for Scotland's national Rory Hughes, released to play in the game by Woriers, allowing Melrose to catch up as a result after Jason Baggut realized an essay followed by a failed additional blow.
Klimo increased the front for the Air from a criminal strike shortly before the half-time, marking the essay after a solo action, and then realized the additional blow, thus making the result 17-5 for the Air of Break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to the Bagg, reduced the front to just five points.
After a prolonged interruption of the game due to a severe injury to Ruard Nott, which was taken to the carrier and after the renewal of the Air match they increased their advance after the Staford McDowell essay and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Afterwards, the current captain of Air Blair MacPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and achieving an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Huttchinson received a yellow card after taking down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal play MacPherson realized the essay using the advanced Eyre offensive line.
Klimo realised the extra blow, and not long thereafter did it again after Kyle Rowe caught the kick-off ball from David Armstrong and took out Gregor Henry's wing at the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from comment, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan had intended to join the improved restaurant business of Glasgow.
“The sea is ours –: the unblemished sea exit Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors are constantly patrolling the oceans with sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are hooked with the motto: “Our sea belongs by right.
It's our duty to get it back.
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – and the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope has been the strongest since decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the international court on October 1st, after five years of reflection have already passed.
\"The force is in Bolivia, there is light and unity everywhere, with the country awaiting a positive result,\" Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila said.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivian sovereign access to the ocean.
Here, Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to face a challenged re-election battle next year, has also put a lot of money on Monday's court ruling.
\"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific, \"promised by Morales last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility of the court making a decision in favor of Bolivia is very small, even if it decides in its favor, it would not change things in reality.
In the Netherlands, the UN authority has no authority to take Chile's territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the final arguments have been heard indicates that the case is not complex, rescinds Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
\"The problem with access to the ocean was blown up by Bolivia's current government, Zarate claims.
Then he hinted that the military rhetoric of Morales had been exemplified and that the little one had remained Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to lead a normal dialogue.
Both countries have not held diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken abnormally quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have \"an incredible opportunity to open up a new era in its relations with Chile -- as well as a chance to \"end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both countries --
Calzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a \"political pathere –
\"The Bolivian will never give up his right to leave the Pacific, he added.
\"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome our past problems,
North Korea claims it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never enter nuclear disarmament first if he is unable to confide in Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposition countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of reopening the impending diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Rie called “a empty hope, the idea that continuing sanctions and objections by the United States of America for a declaration that would end the Korean War would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the declaration without Phenyan first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Like Kim, the President of the United States Donald Trump wants a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyan is serious about his refusal to join an arsenal they look at as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pheongyang next month to arrange the preparation of a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last scream on massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun rays, you don't need to search for more.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their impending collection of SS19, which rocked the fashion floor during the Week of Fashion in Paris.
A lot of impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram during the summer, with designers sending their creations in front of their eyes to crush the fashion community.
Valentino's perv proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar feather-wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included decorated with jewelry dunes, a magic hat and even pineapples – but they have no intention of keeping warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – and on precise time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of higher fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a diving equipment in a complete set of snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted bowl of ice cream.
If you're into such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come soon after the La Bomb – the straw hat with a wig of two feet, which was seen on the heads of everyone – from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a strawed beach bag, almost as much as wearing it with a swimsuit.
The relief bag with the colour of an overburned orange, with a ruffia and a white leather handle, was attracting all views of the article in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacques during the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The styler of celebrities Luke Armid said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer – once the designer has made such an impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for wholesale accessories –
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic award, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career chosen and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can put together and implement a personal educational programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a understood language about him, your words will get to him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high rating A.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved an A score in Chinese, with the same estimate being 72% of the students in German, 69% of the students in French and 63% of those in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scient, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the independent schools programmes and beyond.
A study conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Labour Skills Commission showed that, for reasons of making it difficult for employers to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Therefore, the rule of foreign languages is increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which turns these skills into essentials in a globalized world.
Despite the career chosen, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling several languages of a single breast before competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4000 adult UK citizens in 2013, 75% did not rule a foreign language well enough to be able to carry out language, with the French being the only language whose rule reached a two-digit percentage with a 15% indicator.
Therefore, investment in language learning today is important for children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from the teaching languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child may have, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future hides.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as ‘International Communication Skills’,
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with a variety and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are anxious to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Laker's Coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the team's first match in pre-season preparations against Denver Nugets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's going to play the match.
\"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes, \"announced the funky Walton via Lakers' official website.
A reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel announced in Twitter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After practice earlier this week James was asked about his plans about the six games of Lakers' pre-season preparation.
\"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,\" he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rally, which includes stops in familiar places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmatory vote for his election to fill the Supreme Court's seat, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened by losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time will the Trump rally take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wieling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wieling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will likely look at this week's hearings on the Supreme Court nominations of Brett Kavano, where tensions arise due to allegations of immoral sexual acts, keeping the Senate's confirmatory vote up to a week while an FBI investigation is under way.
However, the main objective of this rally series is to help the Republicans raise momentum for the November elections.
So President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week aim to “activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the Chamber of Representatives, according to Reuters.
\"The Congress's control is of such importance to his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we will begin a campaign season full of commitments, a Reuters spokesman for Trump's campaign who refuses to be mentioned.
Tonight’s rally, planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Weiling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit will take place for this month in West Virginia – the state, which won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morris, who is behind in sociological research.
\"It is not a good sign for Morris that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research, said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
\"Rader Cup – 2018: The US team will fight to the last by keeping its hopes alive before the singles Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue, the Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
The exchange of advantages in sport is a rather subjective concept, in which players believe unconditionally, even more in races like this.
So which team is in a better position right now?
\"They ran six points, and now they're only four, so I guess we got a little momentum, said Jordan Spitt at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points in only twelve more to distribute.
According to Spiethe, however, the Americans still have something to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one took three out of four possible points.
Speed shows an excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The fans' encouraging accents became stronger as he advanced into the round, in which with a precise impact he leveled the score in the fourth match, after with Thomas and left two strikes after the first two holes.
His stroke, which won them the game of the 15th hole, was met with strong repetitive reactions that make us believe that everything is really not lost for the American team.
\"It is important that you think of nothing else and focus on your own game, says Spit.
That's all there is to these players right now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesca Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undisputed heroes so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four and seems to have everything coming to them.
\"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't make \"God's\" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have \"Gods\" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These consistent successes, as well as the way they seemed to pass energy between them and the enthusiastic fans, have confirmed that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory, while the sun sets on \"Le Golf National\"
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The stories of European glory, however, turned out to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the \"Fourball\" game from the morning while he partnered with Alex Norren.
“The gods, and two “dables, ” brought the first nine holes into Spain, and brought the Swedish into trouble that they failed to cope with.
But there is no other way to solve your problems in Sunday matches.
\"Fourball – and \"Foursum – matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, advices that exchange each other, and the way a strategy can change at any moment.
The Europeans played a better team, which is why they gained a significant head start before the last day, but this session of \"foroursom\" – matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last – something many people, especially in the United States, were very doubtful.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of Ryder Cup, after taking the United States 10-6 after playing the game from the Fourballs and Fours on Saturday.
The inspirational duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their activity at the Le Golf National competition grew to four points.
In an effort to recover the trophy that lost to Hazeltine, two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the tomorrow's Fourball match against the Americans who made a mistake after the mistake, and ultimately Europe won the series with 3-1 wins.
The U.S. has proved more resistance in the Foursom, the matches where they won two victories but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points from the 12 singles on Sunday to keep the trophy safe.
Flitwood is the first rookie from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, famous for the name \"Moliwood\", after this sensational weekend, became only the second couple to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
With Woods and Patrick Reed overplayed in the Fourballs, they were extremely motivated to defeat Woods and US novelist Bryson Dekambu with an even more concrete score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, has demonstrated only from time to time the reflections of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in the Fourball and Foursom games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for tomorrow’s Fourballs, partnered with Henry Stanson in the \"Foursom\" contests in the 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka, respectively, number one and number three in the world.
The Europe team, however, has failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas gave back the American hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a tough 2§1 victory against the Spaniard John Ram and Jan Polter in the Fourballs, and later they returned to defeat Paul and Rory MacElroy with a 4&3 in the Foursom, although they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup, a team has happened to catch up to four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team will keep the trophy even in equality.
However, after they were outplayed in two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of turning them around Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says that “there is no way to disarm one - sided, untrusted
The foreign minister of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that the continuing sanctions deepen the distrust of the United States and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation Ri Yong-hou said that in the last year, “substantial measures of goodwill, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test facility and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
\"But we don't see an appropriate response from the United States,\" he said.
\"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances can we first disarm ourselves unilaterally,
While Rie was making known complaints about Washington's resistance against \"a step-up approach to eliminating nuclear weapons in which North Korea will be rewarded, as it has taken step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant, since they did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phanyan did in the past.
Rie called for a joint statement from Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula ” and Trump gave guarantees of security to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking an official end to the Korean War since 1950 to 1953, but the United States says Phenyan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The United States insists that we first remove nuclear weapons and increase pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even object to \"the declaration of end of the war\", Rhi said.
\"The idea that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust,
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the country of the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the removal of the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear weapons would not have reached such a halt.
However, the tone of Rie’s speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable, after “the evil president - Trump called Kim-Man-Raquet - a suicide mission.
This year in the UN Trump, which last year threatened North Korea with \"complete destruction\", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea removes its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said: “It doesn’t matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months,”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Phanyan for the measures taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament takes place,
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop funding the nuclear programme and the Pheyanian ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Rie at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pheongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phanyan in July, saying that progress had been made, but only after just a few hours of North Korea accused him of having made \"gangster demands\"
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile object and a nuclear complex if the United States takes the \"proper measures\"
According to him, Kim told him that “the appropriate measures, which he seeks, are the guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and wishes to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
The Harvard students took a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night with caffeine. ”
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world often don't even think about when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keissler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at a hospital in Brigham and a women's hospital, prepared a course he thinks is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“ Finally, a girl came to me and said: “Why are they telling me this now, in my last year,
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most essential thing about how good sleeping habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve general well-being.
Paul Barajra, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dorm where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the sleeping routine.
In another part of the participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
\"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on health from choice to smoke – added Professor Kassler.
The culture of pride from \"learning all night\" still exists, he says, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep depriving is an increasing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be “the secret weapon ” for students in the fight against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even in order to avoid filling, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a hunger regime that keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Caseler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all graduates will be asked to complete such a educational programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Keissler recommends that students consider setting the alarm for sleeping and waking up and knowing the harmful effects of “the blue light ” produced by electronic screens and light, which can upset the circus rhythm and cause problems of sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal breaks Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kick broke Stephen Gerard's own team and brought a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
The team of Aybrox wanted to record his first victory as a guest of the triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team performed only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18s as a manager, leaving his team eight points less than Harts, leader of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga noted seven minutes before the break, and the devoid of constructive ideas of the Rangers team at no time seemed close to evenness.
After the Rangers game, they're number six, and Livingston's already third, leaving the second Hibernian only to score.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, as side judge Calam Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that broke Eyre in the Cup semifinals of the Scottish League.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same uniform of Livingston, who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team mated all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the power of the ball, but Livingston did better in rarer cases when they owned it.
They had to mark back in the second minute when Menga pulled Scott Pittman out with one touch against the goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the half-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' centering of foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Litgow, removed the ball from the rear beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there had to be a double in 15 minutes when he confronted Stephen Lawles, but the reporter Stephen Thompson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two precise blows in the first half, but the former porter from Aybrox Liam Kelly dealt easily with Lasana Culibali's head and with the weak shot of these Ejarias.
Although Livi's fall at 34 minutes was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was completely deserved.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who cold-blooded Menga for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the vacation by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately resulted in the result when he passed the wing to Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the impact.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a comfortable homestyle game, such as Litgow and Halkett constantly bounced forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' hit, and with the next corner of Litgow, he fired his head against the beam.
The guy who came in as Glen Middleton's reserve from Rangers wanted a double at the end of a fight after a single fight with Jacobs, but Thompson never saw anything wrong again.
Yearbook: Geiger counter inventor
Page of our anniversary Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day in which future physicist Johann Wilhelm was born, Hans, Geiger, Germany.
Geiger is developing a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, invention, which ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
The end stone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a corner stone of pop culture when in 1950 the film “Coronado’s Bells, in which the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans took part.
Man: “What in God’s name is this
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from the radioactive activity in minerals.
Evans: “I'm sure he cares right now,
\"Hans-Gyger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery bearing his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to “see ” – foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to “see ” – foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify foreign cells as part of treatment
The method shall include the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
Then they can “see – a protein that is common to many types of cancer and is injected again in the patient
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine that trains the immune system to identify foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see ” protein common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then inject again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Oncology Institute of the United States of Bethesda, Maryland: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine,
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to the taking of immune cells from patients and training – how to target cancer cells, was used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat marked “Let Us Make America Great Again, In Our SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was played at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after doing a pointless performance, praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat, “Let's make America great again,” he declared against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“ I often talk to white people and they ask me: “How can you like Trump, he is a racist,
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have long left America, he said.
The SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star played a role in Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blazie Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded into the social media by the comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
\"I was being torpedoed behind the scenes.
I was told: “Do not go out with that hat,
I've been torpedoed!
And then they claim to be on a sinking ship, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship, claiming that it will wear Superman’s suit because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love
The comments caused at least twice the public’s twirl and the members of the SNL team looked ashamed, Variety reported, saying: “The entire studio shut up,
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West puzzled many with the song “I Love It – Dressed as a bottle “Peryerie –
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Canada Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the boldest: YOUR BLUER TO BE RIGHTED BY THE TYPE
However, the newsman Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just \"it was herself and it was wonderful\"
\"But I choose not to reward a person (as I buy music or his clothing or support the \"art\" of him) for whom I think he welcomes and distributes ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, as he has now been known officially as Kenny West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, followed by Didi's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snup Dog, was called Snup Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.

Kit Harrington is known for the role of the waving sword John Snow in the full-on violence of medieval fantasy series of NGOs-Plan of thrones,
But the actor, who is 31, has declared against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they must be “worsy ” to be respected.

He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught by television and the street that drives boys to feel that they should become this particular type of man?

HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820 000 people are affected.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of shedding infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health services said at a conference in the Junnan province.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB's communities is widespread.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there is a leak of senators' data from the Republican Party, he has sworn \"dangerous lies\" and \"the theories of the conspiracy\"
On Saturday, US Chamber of Representatives Maxin Waters sentenced the charges that a member of her team had published personal information on three state senators from the Republicans on the pages of the lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The L.A. Democrat said the claims were made by experts and websites of the \"ultra right-wing\"
\"Lying, lying, and more disgusting lies, Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during the Senate hearing of allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanau.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications is connected to the Waters office, and have released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
\"This unfounded statement is completely false and is a absolute lie, \"Watters continued.
“My team member – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This groundless statement is completely false and is a absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
“In this denial there is anger, ” wrote Fleisher.
\"This suggests that it does not have the temper suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
It has to be calm and balanced.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' post in the interim elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“In fact, if it is true, ” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had brought together the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for those false claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed, she continues, and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team,
The Johnny English Revue has exploded again – the weak spy society with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the rebirth of Action-Commediation, a spy franc for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English – and returned in 2011 with Johnny English returned –
Will self - ridicule and mimes, which speak how obvious it is that we are stupid, become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with its eyes closed and the rubber person has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comical creation designed for movie fans who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattery, owns a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean and a large part of the man who contributed a note on the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on the leftover chaos behind a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson plays in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there's either two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing it in a medieval armor, and for a while the fins ran into his helmet.
Atkinson’s contribution to physical comedy and evident, but humor is rather weak and strangely drained, especially when “a serious, film brands such as ‘007’ and ‘The mission impossible’ include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems rather focused on children, not on the elderly, and Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused, as Aktinson's no game reminds Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhaker hacked into the British super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the duty agent -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the premiere, which is an bloated and pumpy figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this Quasi-Tereza-Mei role, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all available agents have been compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center who, however, illegally teaching lessons how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English is creating a spy rock academy.
Ingles has been called to Whitehall for urgent instruction and is rejoining with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man married to a submarine commander, a cheerful role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent has been wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Walta played by Jack Lacey.
Ingles and Bo begin their odyssey by farsses: dressed as waiters, burn French restaurants; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes true anarchy when trying to use the helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the House of Volta.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since it's so cute and noisy, there's a lot more content here for children.
It's a lot of middle-class production.
Just like in the other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Leiberists deny developing a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to have the British work four weeks but get paid for five.
The party claims it wants the company heads to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intellect (II) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy the three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say that the idea would \"false\" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country to the benefit of workers.
Switching to a four-day working week is approved by the Association Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: \"It is expected before the end of the year to be reported for a review of politics.
\"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that is included in the economic rebalancing approach in favour of workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy,
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its overall election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this quest does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Leiberist spokesman said: \"The four-day working week is not in the party's policy;
The shadow Chancellor John MacDonal used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from \"unspoiled directors\" and \"speculators\" at utility companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of shares in water companies may not receive their entire share, as the Labour Government could impose ‘restraints’ on the basis of the established infringements.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers into the board of companies and to create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private employees who can gain annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak 60 minutes ago, whether the investigation of Cavanaugh by the FBI could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavano slowed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the bureau could force some of the Republican party senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, the correspondent of \"60 Minutes\" Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more exposed than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I want to say, of course,,\" Kennedy said.
\"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, and I asked him, “Have you done it? ”
He was determined, determined, and unconceived.
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
\"I have an opinion of Brett Cavanaugh and to change that, it is necessary to shake charges, he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it firmly, ” added Graham, addressing Christine Blassius Ford.
\"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global citizen festival, and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the \"Global citizen\" festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs as impressive a mission: the elimination of poverty around the world.
Now, in their seventh year, the Global citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great Morava in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B. and Sean Mendes, but also meet the true goal of the event – the elimination of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global citizen festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global poverty project, an international group for protection, which hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions – as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, telephone call or connection otherwise in order to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is a “Global citizen ” 12 years before achieving his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to demand action or is it simply another case of so-called \"clitivism – people think they do something significant when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, a global citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions ” by supporters who insist on a number of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equaling more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds already provided had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include “The strength of nutrition – established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, committed to helping children develop their full potential – which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country’s undernutrition once more than 4700 Twitter posts have been received by ‘global citizens’,
\"With the support of the government of Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens such as yourself, we can turn social injustice of undernutrition simply into a historical note – said the Ambassador to the \"Strength of Food – Tracy Ulman to the audience of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken that called on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government reported funding for a project, \"The Power of Food – which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his website's HR, \"Why do you think we can end the exceptional poverty –
“Global citizen – answers: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But just as in the big civil rights movement and against apartaids before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B., Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, where the leaders will be Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use naval forces to \"block\" and hinder energy exports - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces in order to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, reveal US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government – is a prerequisite for researching new energy markets.
\"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe, he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
\"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that the energy products do not reach the market,\" he said.
Zink addressed the event, organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profit targets, which is presented as “the voice of energy consumers ” in the United States.
He was aiming to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
\"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuels – he said, at the same time identifying Russia as \"a single-numbered pony, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with increasing exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable, ” the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into a hostage,
Moscow stressed several times that the $11 billion pipeline of the North Stream 2 - which will double the existing capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fiery opposition to the project was dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be an instrument for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirms its commitment to the project.
The leading German organisation in industry, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential candidate in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would \"look seriously at the presidential runoff after the interim elections.
During the city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
\"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and this includes a woman at the top, she said, according to The Hill.
\"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the presidential run-off,
Warren voiced his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he was \"leading this country in the wrong direction.
\"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy, she said.
Warren was raised in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano.
In Twitter on Friday, Warren said \"of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote,
A sociological survey conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the \"probable\" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey has shown more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed as regards potential bid in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed to Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September entry.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night
\"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who feel the effects of the PTSR and some of the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with, she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest \"a elephant in the room\" and told about his son and other war veterans that \"they are returning a little changed, they are encircled, they are returning, and they are wondering whether they will receive this respect that they and their brothers have given to the country,
He was arrested on Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unscrupulous state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vassila's police department.
18 States and District of Colombia support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the judicial challenge of a new U.S. policy, which refuses to shelter victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the district applied for good faith in Washington to support asylum seekers and contest politics, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name was not disclosed in the Gries v. Sessions case, which the US Civil Freedom Union filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner “and the sons of his gang members ” harassed her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's in Texas.
US lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which there are a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations facing all kinds of gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States has returned the decision to the 2014 appeals council of immigrants, allowing immigrants to apply for asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
The lawyer from Colombia, Karl Rasin, says on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring decades of government, federal and international law,
\"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined in accordance with specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle, the report of good will says.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy which refuses to enter immigrants harms the US economy, stressing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and \"to provide the necessary labour\",
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the provision of asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
\"The shelter is given to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear over race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs,\" Seions said in his July 11th press release on politics.
The belief never meant to ease all problems – not even all serious ones – that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate efforts to save Palu while deaths double during search for survivors
The situation of survivors is getting more and more difficult.
\"I feel very tense,' said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, pacifying her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
\"Every minute the ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the hospitals affected by the 7.5 Magnet earthquake are crowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a spinal fracture and shoulder, were placed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes fill with tears when I recall how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed against the broken wall, and Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. ambassador blames China in the \"tormos\" - with propaganda ads -
One week after an official newspaper in China launched a four-page commercial in the American daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, called on China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of engaging in the US Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's indictment that Pecky is trying to intervene in the US Congress elections noted what US officials told Reuters is that it is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war that equates import tariffs between countries.
According to U.S. and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstadt, the US ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China writes Branstad in comments in the weekly number of Des Moines Register, “at the moment it doubles this harassment by issuing propaganda ads in our own free press,
“In the spread of its propaganda, the government of China took advantage of the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press, making paid advertising in Des Moines Register, writes Branstad.
\"In contrast, on the news stand down the street here, in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's disturbing economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party, he writes.
He added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers avoids the proposal to publish the article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Cavanaugh's rump, Republicans reject women's voters for the interim elections, analysts warn
Since many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and protect the nominations for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano on several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a response, in particular, from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions around the pan are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be taken back, Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Raher said that he doubts whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
\"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November,,\" said Karin Jean-Pier, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, according to Washington's newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted \"Noemwri is coming – during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans controlling the judicial committee decided to continue Kavano's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blassius Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
\"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded – story of the news Stu Rothenberg, a free political analyst.
\"People say the problem is already serious; this is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among suburban voters and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president,
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominations, analysts suggest that a response may follow if the Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
\"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,\" said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
\"It is not only about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavano is on the stand. It is about the way the Republicans deal with it and how they relate to it, said to the press channel Gay Cecile, director of the Priories USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe in as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little more than that of the second.
A new YouGov sociological survey shows that 41 percent of those who responded definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they definitely or probably believe in Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent say that Kavano probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
Following Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims, and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate's judicial committee that Kavano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Ley begins a campaign that aims to compete on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open source of Burns-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burns-Ley, the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination,”
\"We have to do it now,\" he said in terms of the initiative.
\"This is a historic moment,
The Annex uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online storage” of personal data, or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
Looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through each browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “the granting of personal data,”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is that the company invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have concluded a project deal, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers of technology around the world can create their own decentralisationd applications by means of instruments available on the Inrupt website.
Burns-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change or not, when all their business models are fully updated for one night.
\"We do not want permission from them,
In a publication in Media on Saturday, Burners-Ley wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network based on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Ley has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt starts, Burns-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
\"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet,\" Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: In memory of a priest who honored Victoria's cross during World War I
They have been marked for 100 years in the home town of the only English priest who was awarded a cross by Victoria for his involvement in World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been honored with the highest military honours in Britain.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic, for the monument to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under heavy gunfire by artillery and machine guns,
Later, he attacked the line of fire with incredible courage, leading the building forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me feel humble,
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that it is “a great honor for him to participate in the parade, ” and added“ the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided to many people,
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards, and had to broadcast live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., right when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audiences in Britain were stunned when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fen described on Twitter the switch of the children's animation film as \"some kind of sick joke\"
\"The government regulations that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m., so the programme was replaced by a children's broadcast – said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications Belator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
‘Peppa pig – yes-
The president of the company Bellator Scott Koker said they would work on planning meetings to include audiences from Britain in the future.
\"In my view, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Koker said.
\"There is, however, 6 a.m. on Sunday and we cannot plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received many messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you that next time, this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we normally do. We have tried to get more involved in the fans, but we have gone too far.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt “lower because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claimed that until he started studying in high school, he did not realize that “they are not all like me,
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke of gay rights to give “hope ” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent leader of the long-time show, Kirsti Young, is in hospital for a few months.
When participating in Laverne Daily's first programme, he said that he felt \"less than everyone else when he grew up, because \"it was not socially acceptable for you to like girls, and boys,
He said: “To this day my sense of inadequacy and my being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and the strength to succeed,
He wanted to prove that it was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's Games of the British Community in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was \"surprised\"
Daily married Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he took part for the first time in the 14th year of the Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs, ” he said.
Both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daily himself says that “his whole peaceview has changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that all I care about is winning a gold medal,\" he said.
\"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named to his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father could not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ” he told, “you won’t be near me, Dad, nor in the front row.
“ I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at this point when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not vulnerable, he said.
Next year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
\"I just knew that I had dreamed of it all my life - to jump to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no greater feeling, he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud – from Heather Small – who accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him nervous.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
The lost form of Mikaelson stays on the Ryder Cup stand - Saturday
American Phil Michelson will record Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to restore his old form if he doesn't want his record to be tied to failure.
Mikelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the stand by Captain Jim Furik for the Fourball and Foursom match on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the US team again, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most right-lined players, is not in the optimal form for Le Golf National, where the long uneven field usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the field itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth match of Sunday, Michelson will face the precise British Open French Molinari champion, who is teamed up with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points before the 12 matches of singles make a strong start, it may appear that Michelson's game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything very different.
\"He fully understood his role today, beat me back, embraced me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,\" Furik said.
\"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much in the past as this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing just two games.
I expected to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe that we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everybody else,
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in Ryder Cup, played Sunday.
This could end his career in Ryder Cup, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 loses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured in figures.
\"He's funny, sarcastic, shrewd, likes to joke with people, and he's a great guy for every team, he explained.
\"I think younger players have had fun with him, especially during this week.
He's giving a lot more than just to play.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advance may soon be melted.
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Björn, knows from personal experience that the great lead, accumulated prior to the matches of the last day of Ryder Cup, can easily be deleted.
The Danish debuted in the game of Walderrama, in 1997, when the team with Captain Sevve Ballisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but the final line was almost reached and was barely able to hold the victory with 141-2-131-2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great headship of the “Valderrama”; we had a big lead and “Bbrookline” where we lost and “Walderrama” we won, but very hard, said Bjorn, after the 2018 team won 5 – sessions on Friday and yesterday, taking the 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Stand by for attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the end result of the board.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I've been saying all along that I think about only the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are the greatest players in the world,
Satisfying with the performance of the players at a hard golf course, Björn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
It'll be different tomorrow.
The individual performances will come out tomorrow, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all going well, but when you go out on your own, then you test your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you must give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must also be distributed to the end.
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to present themselves better individually than as partners, with exceptions only Jordan Spitte and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furiq himself was on both sides of those big twists in the last day - he was part of the \"Bbrookline\" triumph – and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans committed \"Minah's Miracle\"
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
\"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be good to do the same good start you saw at Brooklyn, as well as at the \"Medah\"
When the advantage moves from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous tension.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading our countermeasure and standing up to Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
\"I chose these players in this order because I believe this gives us the best chance of success,\" Björn said of his choice for singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it would not be done until next year due to faulty systems and head-on rising costs, local media reported.
The deployment of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the brand of new frigates of the class Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, who quoted the army's spokesman as saying.
The vessel was to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the aged Bremen frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of home.
However, continuous delays mean that the avant-garde military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter operation, notes Die Zeit.
The ominous F125 frigate entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to the ship's ship after delivery.
Little is known for the reasons for return, but German media have quoted a number of essential \"software and hardware defects\" that make the military ship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software flaws are particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overloaded, reducing its effectiveness and limiting the possibility of the military forces to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including for training the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the newest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are coming down.
Earlier this year, Hans-Petersen Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually \"exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions,
The official said that the problem had become greater in time, as the old ships had been taken out of operation, but no new ones had been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust tracks the secret life of bats
A new survey carried out in an estate in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
Study by scholars from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the often met bats as well as brown arrows water nightlifes at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key points in the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the bats and which types issue them.
Then a map of the habitat will be drawn up and a report to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a nature counsellor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain in general declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities affecting their shelters and leading to loss of habitats.
The risk of populations may be of wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical work of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
NTS, who is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular studies, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special reserve for bats in the Threeves estate in the area of Daphnes and Galway, which is home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson estate says it's an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threve, we have great terrain for bats, he noted.
\"We have old buildings, many adult trees and completed a suitable habitat.
But there are still many things about bats that are not known, so the work that we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to flourish.
It stresses that it is important to check the presence of bats before the maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible for the unfavorable destruction of a single asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are a species protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee in Trieste for the preservation of bats, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, since we just don’t know what happens to their populations,
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo made allegations of rape against him as \"false news\" by saying that people \"want to become famous\" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German Journal of Journalists Der Spiegel, which published these statements.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he then paid her $375 000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, hours after the publication of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, swore the publication as “false news,”
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news, the five - time holder of the Golden Ball said to the camera.
\"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine. The football player smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims that they refer to as “an unacceptable publication of suspicions in the area of personal life, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherz said the football player would demand compensation for \"moral damage in the amount corresponding to the burden of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years --
The incident in question was claimed to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where he claimed to have raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was “a good boy, a ‘99 percent ’ but in the case he just passed on to the “one percent,
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt \"feeled in revenge\" and was worried that she would \"be publicly humiliated\"
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid by Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK “will be sorry for losing car manufacturers forever
Britain \"will regret forever – if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was \"worshipsome that the Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
\"We need a deal,\" he said.
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of slowing down the border in the event of Brexit without a deal could lead to job losses.
In the plant in Burnaston, where the models Auris and Avensis are produced, nearly 150 000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
\"It is my opinion that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,\" said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, say they're closing down their plant for the Mini model in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a transaction.
Toyota’s production line is operating on the right time, with the parts arriving every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers in order to produce cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which, according to industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than a day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher plant, the company said, and therefore production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that \"the chess scheme of Teresa May for future relationship with the EU is \"exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border --
\"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity, he said in the program 4's Today of BBC Radio.
\"After claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains –
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term warns that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tswarnis, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, I judge that if these jobs go, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have exposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU,
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor-in-Office Rod Rosenstein could be \"another week\", as the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kavano continues to fight, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special advisor Robert Muller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor, or not, thus threatening Muller's independence, has been feeding the rumors of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him Thursday was announced.
Trump said he would “prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate's legal committee, which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment - Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Cavanaugh, further slowing the Senate's full vote.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not yet a date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed for next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed,
Some reporters would contest this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The head of the show Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders responded: “I can’t say that I disagree with the fact that they have protestive behavior,
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
\"The president is holding more questions and answers from every president before him, she said, adding, without quoting evidence: \"We have checked these statistics,
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if representatives of the press have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States of America.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting seniors.
Private press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and strange behavior in front of the fellow journalists.
EU health minister turns to EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service regarding the fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health referred in writing to the staff of the EU working at the National Health Service of Scotland to express the recognition of the state and the desire for them to remain in place after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter leaving less than six months before Britain's EU exit.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of establishing procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralisationd public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on leaving, with decisions expected in this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
I would therefore like to recall how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Members from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having a head injury.
Tenesy State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation after having suffered head trauma during a meeting Saturday when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, Mike Authority of Tennessee reported.
Tennessy State senior coach Rod Reed shared with reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
\"He went to the side line and somehow just passed out there,\" Reid said.
Coaches and medics gave the Abercrombie oxygen to the side line before it was placed on the carrier and taken to the lockers for additional examination.
Tennessee State's official confirmed to Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has exited surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details of the type/seriosity of the trauma, as well as that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-grader with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher coat of arms in the purchase of real estate in Britain
Under the new plans of conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher coat of arms for the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The rise in the coat of arms will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The State Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds per year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms to purchase real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
The move will be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The rise in the coat of arms will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and additional revenues will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current garb account, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for the purpose of granting – may amount to up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects the revenue to rise by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased from people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price hikes and makes it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to get involved in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities, ” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy appears just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the coat of arms order to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by robbing land, but did not use it, and asked Mrs May to abandon available housing quotas to repair the \"warning of housing\" of Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the end of the \"no wines\" exiles.
He also wishes to provide the councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for persons who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as the hardworking people of Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the insult from sleeping on the street remains too realistic,
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the team of Scotland,
Sunderland Manager Jack Ross said that “the greatest ambition, in his career, is to be the senior coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish man accepted the challenge of restoring the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third position in the First League, at three points from the first.
He crossed the State of Light this summer after last season performed St. Miran back in the Scottish State League.
\"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B team, and that was all, Ross told Scotland-based BBC Sportsound.
\"But I grew up with the football games of Hampton, which we watched together as a child with my father, so the national team has always attracted to me.
\"This opportunity, however, would only be opened if I had success at the club level.
Amongst Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names like Dick Advokat, David Moses, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poett and Paolo Di Kanio.
A former teacher of Aloa Atletik said he did not feel anxious as a successor to such established names in a similar famous club, and before that he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
“For me, the success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question “Can I return this club back to the High League –
Because on structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League, he said.
\"It will not be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there,
Ross has been a manager for only three years after spending some time being assistant to Dunbar and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Aloa not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miran from a falling team to a champion in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he does during his football career at Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkark, St. Myron and Hamilton Academy.
\"I was really at the crossroads, he remembers the time when he took Aloa.
\"I really believed that being a manager was the best part for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player sometimes it's hard.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life.

The ideal beer time is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals study
Summer heat increased the revenues of fighters to survive British pubs, but gained more tension for chains of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, the statistics showed.
Peter Martin of the business-consult CGA, who drew up the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged solar time and longer continued from England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar model as in June, when the pubs reported growth by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The 1.8% drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The audiences and bars for drinks reported the best results in their growth compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Publics with meals also suffered from the solar weather, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to come out and have a drink.
In the pubs and bars, the sales of drinks jumped 6.6 percent per month while in food there was a 3 per cent reduction.
Paul Newman, of RSM vacation analysts and entertainment, said: “These results continue the trend that we observed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although a decrease in sales by 4.8 percent of the annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August will bring the desired rest –
The overall growth in pub sales and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting delays in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the implementation of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a confirmed indicator in the industry.
One out of five children hides from their parents a secret social network profile
One out of five children – some only on 11 – has a secret social network profile, which hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 students from secondary schools shows a growth of the fake Instagram pages
News has raised fears of publishing sexual content materials
Twenty percent of the students said that they have a “main ” profile that they show to their parents
One out of five children – some 11 - create a social network profile that keeps secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 students from secondary schools shows growth in fake Instagram accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
News has raised fears of publishing materials with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they have a clear, basic profile that they show their parents and also have secret profiles.
A mother who came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape him, ”
The study conducted by Digital Ageness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of them acknowledge that they keep their profiles secret.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Elyd Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Ailed Doyle was selected to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as Director without executive functions at the annual general meeting of the managing authority.
Doyle is Scotland's light-leather with the most achievements and President Ian Bity has set this move as a great opportunity for those leading in sports to take advantage of her rich international experience over the last decade.
\"Eileid enjoys a great deal of respect in the minor athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the medicine athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting it,\" Byty said.
Doyle said: “I wish to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland,
The American who won the finals at 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would show if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I did a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages.
Advertising a milk pump comparing mothers with cows, separates online opinions
The company, producing breast-feeding pumps, separates the online opinions with advertising, comparing breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding cows.
In order to mark the marketing of the expected “first silent breast milk pump in the world, suitable for wear, the Elvie consumer technology company has put on a mocking musical-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to infants to appear.
Four real mothers dance in a cow’s walnut, full of hay, on the background of a song with a text, including: “Yes, I’m breast-feeding, but you don’t see any tail, ” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a udder, it’s my breasts.
“ Pump up, pump up, feed the babies, pump up, pump up, pump up, breast-feed your friends,
However, the ad published on the Facebook page of the company caused an online dissension.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, saying that many are downsizing the milk processing industry.
‘A very stupid decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth, someone wrote.
The Elvie breast-feeding pump is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic both for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies
Another added: “So much inadequate advertising,
Others protected the commercial, and one woman admitted that she considered the song “extremely fun, ”
\"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Draining made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I'll take it as it is.
This product is genius, written by someone.
Another comment: “It’s a funny commercial aimed at mothers who get high (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like “bloods ”
This is not advertising, praising or condemning the dairy industry,
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in a breast-feeding bra that gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they are draining.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive creative director in Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative placing on the market.
With the drawing of parallels between breast-feeding cows and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on the draining of breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with this, while showing in a fun and understandable way the amazing sense of freedom, which will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump falls into the lead news.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the platform for designer Martha Jakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrants were secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detainees' children rose sharply, although the monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the acute rhetoric and politics of Trump administration make it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear that they risk staying in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other elderly family should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior employee of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unencumbered minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the people arrested had no prior criminal record.
\"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians, or are members of the family of the guardians, reside illegally in the country, most of them being foreigners criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons, Albens said.
In their quest to cope more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days later, as was the previous norm, according to officials in the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally to present their case of legal status to an immigration judge.
Those identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely it is to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to officials in the shelter and reports that have been announced by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as that in Thornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored due to the scale of the place.
They added that moving the children to the “Palatik city, ” without giving them sufficient time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends, may make it difficult for many to cope with.
Syria insists that \"the occupation forces - of the United States, France and Turkey immediately withdraw
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has continued for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the office of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops reside illegally on Syrian land under a pre-emptive to combat terrorism and \"they will be subject to the relevant actions,\"
\"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,\" he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost to its end, in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue \"to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands were cleansed - both by terrorist organisations and by \"any illegal presence of foreigners -
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian military officers who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian troops, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of the devastated by the war country.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are bearable and could return by accusing “some western countries of“ decomposing of baseless fears, which move refugees to stay away.
\"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to these returns – he said.
\"They are turning into a political issue which is a purely humanitarian issue,
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be given to the restoration of Syria until a political treaty is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major fortress of the rebels in Idlib gives the possibility of progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
However, Muhammad stressed that the agreement has \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that the military actions will be directed at the Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related front, Al Nusra, which \"will be destroyed\",
UN envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to soon call on the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and make their way to the elections.
Mualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel must be limited to a \"view of the members of the current constitution\" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election of the 2020 elections unless, as many liberals, he is likely to hope - his presidency will not be terminated prematurely due to impichment and scandal.
That would be without a doubt \"The most dramatic end of the presidency ever\"
There are no signs of fatigue of the viewers at this time.
From 2014, the prime rating increased double to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the Primetime, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show, MSNBC, tops cable TV ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
\"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand, says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's drama, \"The last candidate -- where the secretary of the cabinet is being told, who becomes president after an attack against the Capitol.

Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reunite and the good state of the world economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, the desire to be a informed citizen does not correspond at six hours to watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information ” as a source of his book “Storm”; Paul Manafort’s pilot jacket for $15,000 (‘drew up with an arrogance charge, according to Washington Post” and the distressing descriptions of Storm Daniels about Mr. Trump’s anatomy.
I'm especially never gonna look at Super Mario the same way again.

When I contacted Mr. Fleece this week, he had a sunny, 80-degree northern coast of Kauai, but he closed himself home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.

Investment flows to the most disputed race in early elections for Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the redecorating of the Circles of Congress and from there two holders for the same place.
The recently reassigned district in Pittsburgh's suburbs lists conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in the partial elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another holder, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which significantly advocates the new 17th.
The cards were rewritten after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old circles were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has opened up a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb reported in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress.
The position was taken by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have little leverage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador because of its support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already confessed to Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to \"soon decisions no longer to be recognised by Taiwan\" earlier this month, Heather Naworth, spokeswoman of the Department.
But sanctions were expected only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid to the fight against drugs, with the aim of development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the cutting of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state with its unemployment and percentage of the killings.
With the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves for the duration of such a collection last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration from happening to the United States.
But as of mid-September, the senior management authorities stated that their desire was to hold a conference, thus effectively suspending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens has announced that he will participate in a conference planned for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomats say.
The three US MPs quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report by Special Advisor Robert Muller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, and the report is currently significant evidence in the public register.
Mr. Muller is claiming to direct his investigation to whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack against our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will appear that Mr. Trump will have to take account of this authority, precisely when he is preparing to face the voters, as well as perhaps the jury members drawn up by his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not assume that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor his similar in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to commit a coup against Hitler, as long as the West was committed to him and supported the Chehoslovans in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the massacre.
The walk of history depends on such moments, and the relentless march of democracy is slowing or slowing.
The Americans are currently facing several similar knots.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that he proposed last year to secretly register the president and speculated with the opinion that he is not fit for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein has announced that the Times story is incorrect.
\"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, required by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if he is approved for the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and fraud?
And above all, will we vote in early Congress elections if this forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits her for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I got a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for Shabbat on that table, wearing swastika.
With an inheritance like how I may not be optimistic about our future,
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ” and is author of “The Last Palace: Europe’s Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House –
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the run-in with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians after an impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury did not allow half-protector Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the two-two equation in question with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result can turn into a trampling to greater achievements.
\"We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent – shared the 31-year-old football player.
\"We entered the game with hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were in the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience, we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team's good and the guys are really having fun, training's good.
I hope that we can harness all our strengths to forget last season and achieve the desired successes.
Women worry about fears about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in the study of Nationwide say that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their husbands.
Only 10% talked to their children about this.
\"The people want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken steps towards having this conversation,\" said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Together with your counselor and family discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Including your financial advisor: Your adviser may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your solutions, when choosing a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy, with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with the legal battles from the beginning.
Name your healthcare officer so that you have a certain trustee to oversee your medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a Financial Affairs Officer.
You can choose a trusted person to take financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incompetent.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medications and allergies?
Display these details in writing to be ready.
\"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors are, Martin asks.

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the number of dead expected to rise.
Due to interrupted communications, aid organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnetus of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palou and Dongala located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesi Province, located at the end of the narrow beach on the west coast of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of Sulavesi Island.
The Regency, which the administrative region smaller than the province, has an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the province's central Sulavesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The profit of nickel is also important for the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palou and Dongala have been peaked several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Rehabilitation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami flew west of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located at the seismic “Cycho - ocean fire ring ” and is regularly cut by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acech in North Sumatra activates a wave tsunami that has struck 14 countries and destroyed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Acech.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Truss with a magnetide 6.8 cut off the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnetic 7.6 impact near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnetud 7.5 cuts one of the islands Mentavai and activates a 10-metre wave tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidi Jaya in Acech, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
No tsunami activated this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes killed Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, more than 500 people were killed, most of whom on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice President Sara Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29, of Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report by the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman's friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Paylin has been detained at the Mat-Su Preservation Building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared “innocent, ” reports the media when asked for a plea.
Paylin is threatened with three Class A offenses, which means he can be deprived of freedom for up to one year and pay a $250 000 fine.
He is also charged in a class B crime, which is punishable with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time there's been criminal charges against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drug abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a fist in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016, when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that killed the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnetide 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are cut short, with the number of dead expected to rise in the near days.

Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist assassination, in which eight people were killed -- a rare sentence that has not been executed in the State of Federal Crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, 30 years old, used a rental truck at the Home Depot to commit the attack in October of the veloale near West Side highway in lower Manhattan, trolling pedestrians and cyclists along his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “incidentally ” killed eight victims and “intentionally ” caused severe physical injuries, according to the notice of intent on the request for a death penalty lodged in the South District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could be concluded with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an enlarged federal court hearing referred to Saipov's 22-point indictment, including eight counts of racket-related murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of IPS.
The attack required \"serious planning and intent\", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of execution as \"a terrible, cruel and perverse\",
\"Sifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused trauma, damage and loss to Diego Enrice Angelini's families and friends, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Ernan Felucci, and Alejandro Damian Panuko, said in the notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York has recently sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentences in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York on a federal case was carried out in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a sentence of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekite of the people, did not show a sense of remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to the judicial documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecution claimed.
He also asked the IDIL flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleads not guilty to the prosecution, consisting of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were “obviously disappointed by the prosecution’s decision.
\"The decision to seek a death sentence rather than to accept a guilty and life imprisonment sentence without the possibility of early release will only extend the traumatic effect of these events to all concerned,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the D.A. not to seek a death sentence.
Member of the Parliament of Conservatives says NAJAL FARAJ should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to “mobilize the army of the people ” today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Party of Independence said politicians should \"feel the pressure\" -- as one of Teresa May's own party members, proposed that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a member of the conservatives, said in Birmingham in March that Britain “would have gone out by now, if Mr. Faraz had been the secretary of the Brexit issue.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in order to reconcile with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan \"Chequers – despite attacks by supporters Brexit, supporting the EU as well.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between its package and \"haosa\"
Mr. Bon said to the protestors with the slogan “Exit means going out, in Solihol, that he wants to “reject Chequers, ”
He pointed out that Mr. Faraz had to participate with the rest of us of course and that he had to get the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge, we would have left by now,\" he said.
The Wellingborough MEP added: “I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
As he said of his opposition attitude to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be vindicated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country,
Mr. Bon rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is entirely unfaithful,
Conservators representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, sharing with reporters: “I’m simply saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
\"Chequers is not popular among the wide public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and actually helped to be elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers maintain their position when they keep their promises,
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure, if they are to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it's about trusts between us – people – and our political class – he said.
\"They're trying to change Brexit and we're gathered here today to say, \"We're not letting you get away with this,
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
\"We're mobilizing the nation of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we'll never stop until we're independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom,
At the same time, the supporters of the stay went on a march in Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists have raised flags with the inscriptions \"Conservators Against Brexit after the group starts this weekend.
The Leiberist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems of the party's application when he opened at the conference.
\"These are the people who tell us that they can dispose of IT systems and the whole technology of Canada and yet, for the impeccable crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
\"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit, he added.
Warren says he'll \"think seriously\" - his presidential bid
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would \"thought seriously the opportunity to run for president – after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Democratic representative of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, the constant criticism of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Jeff Dale, who was the joint chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the centre of speculation that she could take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was the 36th meeting with voters in the city building after Trump's entry into office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is high time that “the women go to Washington and correct our damaged government, and that includes women at the top,
There's been an arrest for the death of Sims from LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested in Friday's shooting when basketball player Wade Sims was killed by LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 east time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who appears on the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
\"Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.

Gran Pri of Russia: Louis Hamilton is increasingly close to the world title, after his team's instructions helped him defeat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Botas first ranked from Luis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton, while defending his position in the first two turns, thus allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next tour and went after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to outrun it after a bold maneuver and driving a tire to the tire, which forced Ferrari's pilot with an inability to release the inside of the track to avoid punishment with the added time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defense maneuver on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday Max Verstapen started from the rear rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first tour.
Then he even led a rather long time since the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly outrun Kimmy Ryconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Riconen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Walter did a great job all weekend and he showed up like a real gentleman when he let me out to beat him up.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two places on the floor, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at rally on Saturday because of her claim that she did not spread the letter by Christine Blazi Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh of sexual abuse.
During a discussion in Western Virginia, the President did not directly mention the statement given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, and instead commented on how the Senate's situation shows that people are “wrong and disgusting, and unrevealed,
“ What can happen is the good thing that has happened the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest, ” he said.
\"When you look at editions and spread, and they say, \"Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it.
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we spread... no, we haven't spread... he added, imitating the senator.
Finnstein sent a letter detailing Ford's claims against Cavanaugh in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Finnstein denies that the spread had happened by her office.
\"I haven't covered Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story, \" Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
\"She asked me to keep my privacy and I kept my confidentiality as she wished,
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language I've ever seen.
Continued to defend the Supreme Court's claim charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that Democrats are using claims for their own purposes.
\"They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
Look at the shamelessness, shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control, the president said.

A flight manager died to make sure that hundreds of people on board an aircraft could escape from an earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering a tsunami of waves.
The powerful secondary tremors continued to defeat the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a highly trembling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufry Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was going down.
Later he died in the hospital.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Syrayte, said the solution may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
\"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,\" he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster reaction agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutong is limited.
\"We are suggesting that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves, which reached six metres, devastated Palou, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry aids and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, the ambulance delivers more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's maroers all over the minimarkets.
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross movement in Indonesia, pointed to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
The president of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready, CNN said.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that a person is unknown after a plane crash in a lagoon
The plane that launched a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now reports that a person was reported missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passport.
The airline added that they are working together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details of the passport, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that the six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The reasons for the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Air Force said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane passed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, the passport on the plane, claims the plane went down very low.
\"This is extremely nice,\" Janes says.
Janes tells us that he and the others were able to run through the deep cross of water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He shared that the stewardesses had panicked and were shouting, and that he had suffered a slight trauma to the head.
U.S. Navy forces say that sailors, repairing docks nearby, also helped in the rescue operation using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sinks in the deep about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Air Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have been killed in flights with PNG registered aircraft, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
An analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office closed the case on Saturday in a repeat trial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he had received a location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford was court-martialed on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that \"this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville,
Another disagreement is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlet pointed out that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls, and information about her contact on his phone.
\"He has erased her from his life,\" Hale said.
The defence plan is to start with its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.

Another black man?!
New York nanny sues a couple after firing for a “racist ” message
New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a missent message from the mother who complains that she's \"the other black person\"
The couple denies being racist, similar to the demand of “extremement”
Lizzie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was laughed when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“ NEEEEEEEEEEE, the secondary black skin, ” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, she felt \"unloved\" - Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a fee for a working day then sent home by taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal by asking for the $350 per day for a six-month contract that she was originally hired for, even though she had no contract.
\"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do this,\" she said to Post on Friday, adding, \"You're sure that this is discrimination,
In response to the request, the couple argued that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable action, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
\"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, said Post husband Joel Plasco.
\"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it were wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it.
In the case of blackmail, Plasco claimed that her wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation, ”
\"You're going to attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice, the investment banker added.
While the case is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying their conduct and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel a connection to a speaking bear, a new letter revealed
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was accepted by the audience, tells of the letter: “It is difficult to place yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now that we're aware of Paddyton's enormous success,
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC, before inspiring to write the children's book for a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about possibly rejecting the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book “with mixed feelings ” after his death last year.
With respect to Paddyton, whom she describes as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
\"He was a very modest man and was not a boaster,\" she said.
\"But since Paddington felt so real, it's like having a kid who's achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your doing.
I think you were kind of accepting Paddyton's success like that.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credits of the Padington himself –
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
\"Above kept calling to say that the situation is really bad that she does not expect to survive – said Mrs. Enon-Laperuz.
\"After that, Nad called me to say that he was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given by doctors to support her heart slowly cease to function and leave her system.
She left for a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Enon-Laperuz, who, even so far, mourns the loss of her daughter, gets on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she is going through.
\"No one understood, she shared.
\"I was down my head, and all the while my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this ever-eating feeling of compassion with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her.
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides from bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Welles cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
\"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day, she shares.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Ledney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
\"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lights up every room.
However, he gave up his job before he left, and was in “a dark place, ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences,
Mrs. Davis creates the cards to let people know that he has someone to go to and who to talk to even if he's a friend.
Do not remain silent – you must speak –
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
\"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else,\" she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he looked neither at them nor at anything –
She said that this was a terrible injury to them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens up a void in the family.

Brett Cavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI launches an investigation
I imagined whether we could really achieve what he wants - an investigation with a limited duration and a limited scope - we might have been able to combine our efforts, Mr. Flake said on Saturday, and added that he is afraid that the committee “is falling apart ” despite the confirmed over-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their unwantedness is due to the moment itself.
The early elections are only after five weeks, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republicans are not well represented, their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the country will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush is calling senators by inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House, and by his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives from North Korea is slowing down, at Kim’s
South Korean legislation claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean Unity Ministry, said there were 1127 fugitives last year, and in comparison to 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts requested by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There's no official comment from Pyongyang.
The majority of the refugees from the North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have gone illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border is located with North Korea and is passed easier than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DM) that separates the two roots.
China considers fugitives illegal migrants, not refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Phenyan for talks focused on a standstill in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they generally worked for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress since.
\"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no way to be unilaterally disarmed, Mr. Rie said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh “extremely ” and said that it was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at Congress Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano \"extremely\" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted that way, they would call it \"extremely,\" Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's legal committee Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazie Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural word Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt when discussing his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a \"gross and co-ordinated attack on personality, organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that, according to her, Cavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is prejudiced with the Democrats.
\"I think he disqualified himself with these claims and the way the Clinton family and the Democrats pursues, she said.
Pelosi denied when she was asked if she would try to discredit Kavano if he was appointed and in case the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so – if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unfit to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he is now,” Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that, in her capacity as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavano's potential decisions regarding the Law on Available Health Cares or the Row v Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
\"Now is not the time an hysterical, prejudiced person enters the court and expects us to say, \"Is it not wonderful – Pelosi finished.
Women should also be mastered.
It's a reasonable criticism, after months and years of bursting of rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
\"We cry when we are angry, \" Mrs. Steinum told me 45 years later.
\"I don't find it unusual, but you,
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive manager somewhere who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to whom when she got angry and wept, she tells her neighbor, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And then it just keeps going.
I thought this was genius.
Tears are allowed in terms of anger, partly because they're misunderstood at the beginning.
One of my clearest memories of previous work, mostly with men, is how once, while I was groping from inexpressive rage, older than me, my wife caught me by the door – a distasteful head, which I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry, ” she told me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy to have done it to you.

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship of a yacht called \"Monkey Business\" and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president herself.
\"It was not a well thought-out decision, she told me 30 years later, laughing.
\"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing that wanted to happen was another one coming up.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves –
As she is involved late in the campaign, she is behind with fundraising and decides she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is pre-dated to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
\"Do they think I'm getting a discount, she wondered.
During her speech, which states that she will not continue with an official campaign, she is filled with so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, a dissatisfied against the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and be able to turn to voters, not delegates, and anger against sexism, that she felt.
\"A man may think I've had a nervous breakdown, \"remembers Mrs. Schroder's reaction to the media.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were going to write on my tombstone?
She's crying.
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, while the battle was yet to gain speed, a break between the two countries would benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, fired the first warning paper this year, betting on taxes key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension occurred this week with new duties affecting production of 200 billion U.S. dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing returned new bribes with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every strike in the United States and soon it is not expected that the second largest world economy will ignore this.
To make Washington give up means to submit to demands, but to put a chapter in public in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for Si Jinpin, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards correctly, pressure from the U.S. trade war can help China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence on the two economies.
\"The fact that a hasty political decision both in Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have recognised before,\" said Abigail Grace, a scientific co-worker on issues related to Asia to the Asia expert group Center for New American Security.
Syria is \"ready to return the refugees\", the foreign minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in the reconstruction of a country devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the state are improving.
\"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore them to their normal condition.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe Beats Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the Ryder Cup for 2018 by overcoming the US team with a final score of 16,5 per 10,5 per Le Golf National, in the areas of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has lost six consecutive losses on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who presented himself poorly in the majority of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with a-a-pair-3) in the water with which he lost his match against Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari presented himself perfectly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, having reached a 5-0-0 balance since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Speed lost definitely 5 & 4 to the player in the European team, located at the lowest place in the ranking – Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 from Ian Paulter of England, for whom this is probably the last part of the \"Rider Cup\"
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participants in Ryder Cup, became the European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its asset to 25.5 points this year.
\"I usually don't cry, but I can't stand it today.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for having called and believed in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
In all the most important, the team is, and I am happy that I have been able to help, says the excited Garcia after Europe's victory.
He handed the baton to his fellowman John Ram, who defeated US legend Tiger Woods with 2 & 1 on Sunday.
\"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play, \" said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and his overall balance of \"Rader Cup\" is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics on one of the greatest players of all time, won 14 major titles – an indicator that only gives Jack Niklaus a discount.
The US team has been having difficulties all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf in all the days of the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik said after a disappointing performance of the team: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
Once upon a time, we pressed Europe's team this morning.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will look forward only.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you're not taking your opponent's hat off.
We were just outplayed,
