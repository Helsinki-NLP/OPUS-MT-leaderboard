It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, it wasn't me.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
It'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Have I come to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
What's it worth?
The water was at our throats.
Tom pretended to notice Mary watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom picked up the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
She looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it so far.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider the nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves were stalking the herd.
That song's been haunting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to give myself up to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom's safe.
I don't live in Boston.
They're suing the government for the damage.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about tomorrow we meet?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's got a little bit of a crush on his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I'd say no.
I'm obliged to help him.
He's critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit gum.
I really want your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go for a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from the monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually have lunch with?
I consulted him.
Have you ever considered quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop calling Tom out.
What could possibly go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than take the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary did the movie.
She has a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom, I wrote this report.
Is this what they buy?
Doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
It was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
He asked me to take a look at him.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs when I'm cold.
We met several times.
Nobody liked soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is incorrect.
I'm trying to explain this to you the way you're going to understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom treated me like shit in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still cost the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree to that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient and even humble.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're Humanists.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I want the tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's pathetic.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We take checks.
Vesnikov costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one shot.
Macedonia has four Glagolitic ways: expressed, adopted, in command and reproved.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected its features as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember how I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will Japan's economy be like next year?
That's how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I need to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our palace is great.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom fucking kicked me out.
I was only gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a good stand scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to take a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't attract attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite baton.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trallator.
Who's on the list?
He's got a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I come with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom's ever complained about is food.
Make sure you don't mess up the mud bar.
They were both coughing.
The train passed through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Is the price included?
That would follow.
You want some tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today's the worst day they'll ever try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary from kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's completely wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom P.D. already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a dirty room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
“ It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. ” “ Then why are you still alive?
She was smiling so quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on his face.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do it.
Tom, don't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.

It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by humanoids.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Take a walk.
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Get the clamp out.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star shining.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is blunt.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When are you supposed to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's no rock height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.

Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.

Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the treetops.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll resume the whole thing.
I don't know about that.
I couldn't stand it at first.
He's got his sleeve attached.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left but him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked beside him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.

Tom mistakenly told everyone that I had died.
I think we found one.
The report deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I've done a thorough examination of the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved concerts.
Ask them to join us.
Where do you want me to park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom was drinking from a bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn apart.
Tom got Mary to donate the money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is it deep in the lake?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.

You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard's really hot.

I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say \"no\"
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to leave for a while.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom's been developing the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you were hoping for.
I just fired them.
This has been fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom needs help seriously.
You have to stay away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?

It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving through town with the brake up and down.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camping trip?
Who broke the toilet?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own behavior is also undesirable.
He wears high heels to make it higher.
You want a bowling alley?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't shout.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How stubborn you are.
Did somebody hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used a few different expressions.
The bucket's pouring your energy!

Something very similar has happened to me!

Tom already told me.
They've got to drop the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes flashed with rage.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
“ I want to travel, ” I said, “and I -
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He wanted to meet Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Maybe Tom's richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
You apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
Hardwings, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get you this as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took his knee off.
Where did the piñoli come from?
Can I talk to you upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I see the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.

Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.

I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You cook turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so what does he want to be?
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father carried me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tom's arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always messing with his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very helpful.
Tom's got a vibe on his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl was moving slowly.
It turns out you're incredibly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, and you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They got him to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have much of a priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had nausea and she suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I can and I can do.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix yourself.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a fornicatory dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the honey to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to be helping them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom had his eyes flashed when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Can you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl said hello to me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue. This is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they turn one year old, so they eat people.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends money he doesn't need is water.
We're not holding anything back.
I guess I just didn't think.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times not to exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask me to explain.
Come on.
It's a book that weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom's always lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously misspeaking sounds, and I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you teasing me?
Please talk to me.

Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not back.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing right in front of her.
There's more than one way out.
Tom's always been so protective of the kids.
I asked the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six lazy slaps.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven't found the time to write that report.
I can do without it.
And there are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's dressing.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love walking by the river in the morning.

Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to squish?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.

Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we're eating cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.

There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Dinner's good for me.

It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.

I'm not here for you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The Amoebas are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't mean Tom's dead.
Waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French people write their word for “bubbamara ”
The hoist can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
Is that all right with you?
We're pretty good.

Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom was having a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters have been blackmailing a lot of money from the rich guy.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
I want blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take a tissue, your nose is flowing.
Tom was dating Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
Originally, they were farmers.
All you have to do is trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She's got ten kids.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.

Go this way.
You're in the back.

I can't convince Tom.
I can go.

Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?

Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.

Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.

I can get it from her.
Bring the food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's making us work too much.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and at every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not the same as the steps of the steps.

Tom's never there.
Please give it up.
I'm sure I can find him.

The answer was yes.
Happy lovers do not record their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.

They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed distracted.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got a wave of the car.
I'm not blue.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you get out of here like that, you'll catch a cold.
Is it still hurting?
It was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.

What's the shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.

We're supposed to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them back.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a cavalier.
Now we're even with him.
We're walking to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
She was taking her hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.

You ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.

You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary prided herself on her own.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they scared?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pens.
Who do we have to worry about?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They've concluded that the ship sank without fail.
Did you buy the cure?
Has Tom been drinking?
I'm in pain.
The question is who's gonna do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Everybody happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was wrong at all.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He's on foot to school.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very cocky.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
Ended fourth of 56 runners.
Don't shout.

These animals are threatened.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to see her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.

Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they're getting better once he's had a few beers.
You've got kind eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, right. It'll be fixed... when the willows give birth to the grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Who's got fireworks from?
It's possible Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?

Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!

How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something?

What would Tom be looking for?

Can someone help me?
We'll leave this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you call Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is resolved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.

How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm really good at it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who runs this place?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Each nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
How did it come out? That's how it went.
His legs were numb.

Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.

Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise in Hawaii for a year.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most feel that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Dude, you can't just walk up to a woman and get her together -- that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's a sitter.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
It was a lot of blow.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive yourself than to be a pessimist and to be right.
The water was so soft.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The ship's body is divided into more water-tight parts.
Since you're cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose your touch.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
\"You're mad at me.
He's not as shy as he used to be.
You know what I mean?
Don't make a scene now.
What did Tom say?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys all over the place divided into groups, some playing jamleys, some slabs, some with a ball, others driving a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both should go.
The pain that causes love is rarer than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I was just having breakfast.
Let's just stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from inside.
Nobody believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He smashed his head.
We're gone.
Put the seat back on.
What's he up to?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's getting mad.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please maintain contact.
Yeah, I'm angry.
Today is less wet than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine who loves the baby because it points to both of them.
That's not good enough for me.
I've got to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught him in a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false clue.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain down.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for it.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody's singing.
Can you fix the bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're lunched?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a hook on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing just fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know that Tom will be out of jail eventually.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
No food ran out.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at six o'clock?
Tom's sitting down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just staring at my room, waiting for my recovery.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard me.
Tom's head hurts.
Oh, don't be.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You did your best.
He's greedy.
First, let's talk about what Tom has to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you've told them that you're going to give it to them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the solution?
Is that necessary?
Tom's back.
I'll never kidnap you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you should call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts very much.
We were 18 years old then.
I make 13 bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I want a broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I'm in a mood to see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran off.
Keep doing that.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They've drunk you.
Tom started feeling sorry for himself.
I think you should choose her.
Stand up.
You're great.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and imagine a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom cruelly looked at Mary.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her back.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I swam into the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
They're not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if I could.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
It's been a lot worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
Nobody's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a poet.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth full.
Everyone's in control.
Every customer has rights.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's making an argument with us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties very often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not very fond of it.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think I've been followed.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a great pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.

Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get caught.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill in the form.
I don't imagine a party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom's putting on his butter toast.
We got a job to do.

I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the hill.
I'll take whatever you want.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom was apparently used to these kinds of problems.
You're gonna be okay.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's all right.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the losers are guilty.
Tom gave Mary the doll.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if you can even say it's possible.
It's been an arena day.
I bring bad news.
This isn't helping.

How many pushups do you do every day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was rotting on alcohol.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is difficult.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
You won first place at the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You're being devious.
Everyone was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it looks weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.

You're out of alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
This song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.

We have not yet been saved from the danger.
Tom's freaking out.
He's been waiting ten minutes.

We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this seat available?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to get caught anyway.
Does no one want to sit with you?
It would be really nice if you kept your mouth shut.

Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.

Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.

I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's in a lot of trouble.
What kind of situations would you use it for?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without any help from anyone else.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.

Let's all go get me.
This is a good place to park.
I've been going to Boston all the time.

I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.

You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to protect the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.

You're allowed to sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear is green.
Tom repented what he told Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom's getting all worked up.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom brushed his hair.
Everyone's sitting down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't feel good walking.
She seems a little young to be married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
Let's get started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Do I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
I need you to write Tom a thank-you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.

Come on!
And if he refuses, what if Tom doesn't?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to eat in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be made.
I turned the lamp around.

I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.

That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone gains their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
Tienina stretches a lot when it's washed.
The truth is a goal, not a destination.

Have you ever read this?

This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.

He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?

Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Is that possible, Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
They voted him Mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene.
That's what I asked.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?

I said we're closed.
The question is who's going to tell him.
Tom next to Mary was sitting.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarkasam?
Tom's a vorcipa.
I'm gonna have to try to deal with this on my own.
They designed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Do you know for a fact that this isn't made diamonds?

I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going either.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
A living soul wasn't in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much anyway.
You're a nice cook.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
It's obvious you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automatic cars are now spread out.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's carrying chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I did Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my snack?
The orgular was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you should help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making a cadgan.
I love blue.
The girl set the bird free.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugars my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with it, it'll be done.
I rang for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipes?
They picked her up pretty good.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We've got three kids.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
She was a business to me that I spent the night with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a thug.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A 2005 census was held.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me the other night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
They're dressing up to bathe.
The river of sweat began to pour on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you do?
Movies are a great pastime.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me want the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan to leave.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight has been cancelled due to unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what's the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They can come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was making all the wood.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to keep an eye on Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee and Tom likes to drink hot coffee.
I gave her a fake address.
I'm in a room.
I'm not happy anymore.
Chances are Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think about Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's on the hook.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
Why would I need a lawyer?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
He looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Wake up.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost ran into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get burgers.
You've probably seen worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's looking at a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him back.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please come in on time.
The Germans have a slight attitude towards nudity.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid the body in a large grave.
Women love men with mustaches.
You've forgotten your wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come by tomorrow or not.
If we don't do this, then who does?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They were both screaming.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I was out of luck.
His body was grown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary crying.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island’s settlers are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I was going to tell you.
What's the deal with this hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wishes he'll never come back here again.
Nobody likes crying.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's a little dorky.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got there first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes out.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate very nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bore you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought stinky trash bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
The time has come to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's not fully aware of what happened yet.
Cocaine is drugs.
This is a little harder.
You seem to know the answer already.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was a chestnut brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I'm never looking for a handle.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
You didn't need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's the matter with him?
I love someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm French.
I don't want to see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wit.
We need to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname suits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
She's ruining her clothes.
You took out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's not happy to go.
Tom seems a little down this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked the mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book.
Marco thinks he's writing skillfully.
Tom took a look.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a dick!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom wouldn't give in.
Tom was suspended.
They're getting along.
She'll become a teacher.
I don't intend to tell Tom that.
I'd like a marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrified.
Tom seems a little fluffy.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're closing up.
He's been working at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom gets mad.
It's work.
We'll be fine.
Commendations encourage students to work more hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan got attacked by two of them.
Tom's weighing on the scale.
Something must've happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom's got his nose up.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only for the nobles.
Tom's been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How do you choose a man only one?
I came to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the blooded bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
Couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so fun.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your child's laugh.
Tom suspects that Mary and I have something to hide.
Just leave us to heaven.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.

Don't mix business and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom's been busy.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unbuttoned.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and directed it toward the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary's help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom's writing very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
Once he's naked, his heart stops.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent $1 million to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, and my head is killing me, and I'm a very hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember his name.
I'm gonna get my hands on your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom shut the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving with caution.
Just go inside.
He picked a sword out of steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had so many more of us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
It's a day of rage.
I don't even know which one is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned how to swim in.

You've gone too far!
He's got a son who's gone missing.

Tom's going.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim a lot?
The girl's asleep.

Tom paid me.
I like reading books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have lots of kids.

Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone's got their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one case less than me, she complained that she had too much to wear.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for one second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in the orange.

Give us some time.

Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I set fire to the waste.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropical region.
I think I made a nice point.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this a little too convenient?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom doing?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say over the door?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.

That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you've been taking a lot of care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
You can't handle this heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you immediately.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you could say.
I cannot handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
Now I'm looking for them.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree sails.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
Put your hands where I can see them.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.

Louder.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel about it.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justified.

\"I see,\" said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom's turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I'm having trouble with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you so.
Tom ran out of water.

Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a vertigo.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was crushed with sperm.
Tom's fair.
This is what you have to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand what you're saying.
Tom's trying to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One's life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
You're overpriced.
We're being childish.
Tom was a bosnog.
Tom would have enjoyed this.
Tom's up there.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started it now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The neck's flattened the tire.
We made wood.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her use your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a freshman.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know what that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and clamp.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the disease.
Tom tried to help me.
They've broken the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It's still bad.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you honest?
The Philcan was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'm gonna call somebody.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is at risk.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror is clouding in the bathroom.
Tom took a picture.
Tom thought Mary was going to Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
\"Are you a vegetarian?\" \"No, you're a vegetarian.\"
The lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I don't speculate.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father had died.
They've raised my salary again.
I'll never get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in the horoscope?
I know how to go.
I contribute.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his job.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom put all this together.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's so soft.
Also, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did what I had to do.
Tom's a long way from here.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I don't know about that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, that violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are opposite men.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was fertilizing the pus.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw the papers at Mary's desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
Looks like these two are back in a relationship.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
A moral choice is for the translator to translate something or not. Some things are better left in the language he produced.
You're nasty.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems anxious.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I'm impressed with Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun varies all the time.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked deep into Mary's eyes and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You should have found them.
I couldn't sleep over.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known for time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a kid.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We could have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a groovy.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend it.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's medicine in powder.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was pleased to meet her granddaughter.
It's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's had a heart attack.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
She's good at tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
He had a big problem with it.
She's slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think that's what it's all about.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer's dead.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
So the conscience does make us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You made a mistake.
We're glad to see you.
Now you must leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen's turning green.
English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where does the evidence come from?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The wound to the knee is now festering.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't bring anything.
Tom's a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He's lost a lot.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint with mint?
Why would Tom do this to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to stay the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'm coming down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mom?
Tom wasn't an easy guy to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a walnut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it might be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom reread the note.
The kids were drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You wonder what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married at age 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and we're not under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he hears something.
Tom's always trying to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't often understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the magnificent stars in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She's a good swimmer.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me all the time I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You don't follow.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangulars don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom was counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick away.
Well, guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me when it's light.
Mr. Gorbachev, bring down this wall!
Tom seems amazed.
Tom's getting high.
It's the way it should be.
Let's try and get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't enjoy retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom will fight much.
What are you grinning about?
I'll call him right back.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's no big deal.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school in a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the sayings?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night was when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
That's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in the ass.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's mad.
Tom's gonna be asleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom got here on time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, beautiful!
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got to say goodbye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom got here safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very much like Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept quiet to Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming.
We're on our way to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was awful.
You owe me nothing.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He's been very insatiable.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
In case of an emergency, what number do I call?
I still love a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started bickering.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say \"hi\" -
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be objectively determined but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's insufferable.
His girlfriend lost weight.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from a nightmare.
Tom's got weak eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not too happy for a peacemaker to arrive.
Open it.
Put your apron on.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom's got a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
I already wrote everything that needed to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my bedtime.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're so sassy.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dadba really slow today, or do I think?
Did you ask me to Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back on track.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom got himself a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, right?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see a thing.
He's quite an unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You'd better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hooked another one in that place.
Stop!
You want some cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows aren't clear at all.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's broken.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Get your hair cut.
It's a waste of energy.
Tom went into rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's looking inside.
At the same time, you are heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live without you either.
Let's say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
Nobody complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's what lets him down.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom's a spine.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'll take care of it.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd both better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very furry.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom didn't even cry.
You wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is sadder than stupidity and indifference.
They all do.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What's with the websites?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the wallpaper out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
The doves symbolise peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm getting sleepy.
It has not been scientifically proven that there is a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking all over for them.
I love your website.
I'll get you.
Hit this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom ripped his car apart.
You've got to get through the trouble.
Tom wouldn't break Mary's heart.
All lizards bring eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is roasted in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see the way things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a text from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very much like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There's a lot of rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have sheds.
A lot of wood collapsed.
Lions don't tell the difference.
That wasn't true.
The answer's screwed up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.

The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.

How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.

Where are we going?
I'll get it back from them.

I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He's the one I found out about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
The long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go and help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a donut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it was done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Did you get outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's a wreck.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
That was our only comfort.
Nobody would care.
Did you write in your diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why do you bend?
Come on, Tom.
I'm gonna make sure I get there on time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause a disease.
We're about ready.
Tom has a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take out the wallpaper.
I helped him turn the table around.
I had a steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to walk down the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom drank it.
I slept in the chalet.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That could be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded it to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He hit me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom's acting like he's done.
Having fun continues your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demek I need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
No matter what, I'm guessing.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just cut Tom's room off last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I would've sold this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
It turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets very much.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
You got in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent a new fly to the table that he just bought.
Tom's gonna help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's a dick.
The landscape is airtight.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated his victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'll try to contain myself.
The fall is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What is the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so grand.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a class.
All human beings are born free and equal by dignity and rights, they are gifted with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do it all by himself.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you to fix it.
It means yes or no.
Tom's staring at the tunnel.
How could you want to be my friend?
I think it's familiar.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
There are limits to everything.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosil, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a insightful man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid too much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered, even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but I'm not here!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled some coins.
The room was a cabbage shopper.
It's just to solve this problem.
They need to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If he can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your parasol.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect's confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how much it hurts to get bit by a catfish.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look into the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it's out of the question to ask Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You shouldn't like everything.
Caloric potatoes?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary's tail.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him faces.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry about Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing under the street in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I remember a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all in a lot of trouble.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there is a film called “The Russians Come! ”
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the journal in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom's got a babbling collection.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mouses are plague carriers.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's taking a shit.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
They're hugging us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's okay.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty good.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me my responsibilities.
Do you need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me out a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds really hot.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his strings.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should quit?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this all the excitement?
Tom's going off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rings.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's a non-negotiable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little frowny.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom has surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are species of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in large pots.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
You wiped your wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the front.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please take out the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary this morning.
I'm making honey toasts.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I've got a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunshine.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna lose weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefit do we have?
I'm with exactly the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't really see anything.
- How are you? - Okay, thank you.
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom needs to be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quickie.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We've done nothing wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were totally confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to make amends.
This is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
I've got the dog with the stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
You wrote this book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not get cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with his dog.
Tom got drunk yesterday night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must grow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmud can't stand to lose.
Nobody's listening to you.
Okay, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go into pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's hopeless.
It's a little forward.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help you look for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
It would be my pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff's here.
Stay as long as you like.
Take me for a crab.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedant in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember he was in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I do a day?
Will you cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's been turning into a beggar.
You've got very pervasive eyes.
Isn't that supposed to be?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I write pretty well.
Will you get back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's smoke and get inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems reliable.
Would you like some water?
Tom's not friendly.
Yet, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
Squares have four corners each.
I kept working.
It's developing addiction.
Would you like me to go with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary went after her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
The mass is over.
Tom erased the blade from the jeans.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can make that happen.
Do you have blood on your palate?
Just let me hear from her, okay?
Tom put a pint of beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
Give me a seducing look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far have you gone?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you coming down?
Give him a dollar.
Did he have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me sharp through my glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is durable.
I just need a vacation.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't mean for that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
You came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression over more than his life.
You want me to grab your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class went wild.
There were penguin feet on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the slipper.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I don't talk fast.
We need to speak in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was looking for something.
She's an English student.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on the chewing gum.
Make it mine.
I got them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easily bad habits develop!
She's been acting weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she had an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer to that?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat in time.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are as strong.
The president looked strong.
Buy what?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were better at playing chess than I am.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, everything can happen.
You're a tight town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's the bell tom?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer be careful.
Tom's been running away from class a lot.
Now is the time for compensation.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be fine.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get into one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French than he really is.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaking.
That drug calms the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom fun?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Foucher did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to your boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works well.
Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got freaked out.
I prefer goat cheese to cow.
We get that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut down the tree.
I think you've been here before.
It just took me so long.
Where were you born?
Xena, finish it.
Single couples should not be able to marry.
The cow forgot it was a calf once.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a handiwork.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister break the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's no sign of Tom yet.
That's when I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.

Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any money anymore.
The chair is plastic.

I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
Get serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
You stood me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
Brought after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
First snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
Now we need it.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood flows through the body.
I'm gonna make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
It won't help lies.
My toe hurts.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them gifts.
What would the prince want?
Where are we coming from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's baking for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message for her?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Watch the drawing.
Their houses were built from stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom wasn't thinking about that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to walk.
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're annoying me.
But not before the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You were right, guys.
It happens.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a difficult task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, dear.
They have increased the territory of the empire.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom probably already knew about it.
My sister and my mother is my aunt.
I've been looking all over for them.
Tom's incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It went red.
I have to go.

It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll come by tonight.
I fixed his radio.
It's a leather belt.
Tom hung a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have such counsel in mind.
His saying is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where'd you put it?
Tom can't take defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom said he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You shouldn't be there for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom a tissue.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't feel bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I'm standing up against a wall.
The clock is broken.
Tom needs to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom unwrapped the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was standing in the middle of the ruins.

Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his daddy very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom did well today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we got.
It's no secret Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you up to?
Now this is your house.
How about a little sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing just what I want.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, no charges have been made.
lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.

He feels hate for his dad.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I need to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with their comments.
You don't have to go.
I could barely save myself not to get caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the rat?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You tricked me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're throwing it away.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was in three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything better.
The sky is red at dusk.
I came to wish you good luck.
It would be my pleasure if you came.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I speak ill English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy you beat?
Dan understood this well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
It was quiet in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a rough test.
It's hot in hell.
I've overlooked that.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
Stay here.
Let me congratulate you on your wedding.
Children, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Does your dog bark?
Beautiful!
The palace has a tower.
Kids have homework to do.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's on the move.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I wouldn't mind if you left.

I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like he's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole is tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying that?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Move aside.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's been raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's been blind since birth.
The book contains fifteen resumes.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.

I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
Tom's buried in Boston.

What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dalida died of an overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a butcher.
I have faith in me.
Tom's here, isn't he?
It's raining.
Ish, you dog!
They're in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.

Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom's a little freaked out.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you a house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's her.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there is a solution.
You're disorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you complete the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Are you having a sports thing?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.
Tom has been lying to us all along.
Tom hasn't said he's gonna help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people of Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I only practice to look nice when I'm naked.
A thousand years make up a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
Word of honor.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you imagine in a few words?
Tom was there.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I want a crusade.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took this picture.
Tom closed his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a kid.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I want cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.

That was very sweet.

I'm used to talking in public.
She was crying for luck.
Tom's out of jail.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for the green light.
You want me to massage your shoulders?
I've got it on my head.
I blinked my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But it's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going and I'm going.
I'm going to change.
He hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find me a head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me one minute?
Never, ever, never could have happened here.
Tom was heating up before the fire.
This is not what I want to talk about.

We can get started.
Come alone.
You run a pencil out of your pocket.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't take any chances.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just looking at himself.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom won't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is, what are you going to do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're in no hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was raining two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The cannon from the horse's hooves calmed him down.
Soft hands.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing humble dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He outsmarted his schoolmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he wanted to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom for permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is aimless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I danced with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling ourselves.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes more money than I do.
I got one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to make it to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
He's visiting us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your purse?
Most of all, sleep will help her.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll wash the dishes.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dowdon has been doing a lot of intense work lately, but he doesn't see the slightest result.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not convinced.
That's no longer necessary.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Your sister, where is she?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom's got an OCD.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
She spent the last night drinking in a meat inn.
I'm in.
Do you need a rende?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I believed him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I don't think they were following us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave Tom alone.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom so tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
At that time, we were just a few people in a group of gorillas.
She started sticking her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
Are you traveling a lot?
Have you told Tom about the back pain you've got?
Everybody does.
Tom's often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom's collecting stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
A is a group that consists of members of B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if the three of you came back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom's practicing the violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I yearn for it.
Tom's had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're on fire.
She was able to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's rhumm.
At your service.
I like watching football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this much food?
This is one of Boston's most popular restaurants.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I'll have to clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to grapple with sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't say a word.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days do it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We'll have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's nice to me.
No one's gonna find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm starving you to get down.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was coming down slowly.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do it; either way, you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to take our thoughts away from our problems.
I called yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Warn the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom's nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't possibly do it himself.
You're a wise man.
Nobody went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I've got chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show yourself first.
My father's a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional thug.
You stole my new wristwatch.
It doesn't look very different.
It's being studied.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
We're throwing it away.
That's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did I crash?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your statement is up to date.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the jewels last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetal movements?
I can't do it alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
Pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
The payer has the right to be a master.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy takes place every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening well.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom won't like that.
All comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call for help?
Tom cried his mouth out.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not mistaken.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
A noble without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I was taking a nap there for hours.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a pair they are!
Is it early this morning, Tom?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's loud in here.

I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through works.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America, you're supposed to tip the waiter.

That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Leave while you still can.

I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
It fell off the tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half-son.
Don't expect everyone to feel the same way.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna stray.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got bit by something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch Tom.
They look familiar.
We have a job for them.

Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.

This is really easy.
Are you walking?
You should try it.

I'm worried about him.
Tom's great.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Make it short, Tom.

We could've done it.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The card was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, a football field and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
When he was eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should've given up early.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been deluded.
“Why do you do that? ” “It’s possible for me –
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom, let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds perfectly acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trusting and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give in.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't shut up.
She shut down the computer.
She bought that at the butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two breeds in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's got his hands tied.
Tom was a prodigy.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to be proud to pass them on.
The noise's been messing with the city.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom your note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You've got small breasts.
I mean, Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom did.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing a suit attack.
Tom was a boss.
That's ugly.
There could be discussions about that.
Women don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem. It's mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions, and second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
It seems to be boring to the audience.
I grow cattle.
She borrowed the ruler.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom take part?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and you're turned down.
I wish I could help you more.
You can't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I drove past it with a car, I didn't recognize it.
Is this all there is to it?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's just.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to do this without great help.
Tom knows Boston pretty well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
It's a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's running.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser poured out boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all of Tom's money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I could go back to.
I'm here on my own.
It's to protect you.
I've always been helped by someone.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to older ones.
The gems include aquamarin, an amateur, a emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission earlier.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
That's a lot of chicken hunting.
It's been a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things he didn't remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
From all the languages I have learned, the French was the easiest.
Tom wrote his homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
The boy looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We've got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you get the money on loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is wonderful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea in particular.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed at Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deep.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Is everything there with a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom's got plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a beautiful link.
Go see if Tom's in his office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He got a lot of money out of her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make cobwebs.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what they say.
He's head to toe in love.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's eldest daughter isn't married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's pain trap.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're insane!
It seems to me that it's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm gonna do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
The sound soon died.
Who's got your hair?
I don't quite understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom wasn't holding back.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It's been a great day.
It's been a beautiful evening.
I think I might sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to watch him?
You're a real man-hat.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's best not to drink the water.
No one's talking.
What did you think of contacting them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
You should be all right.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another hand.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He had fun listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to judge his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to hear you.
Stop where they are.
Are you her pimp?
\"She likes music, doesn't she?\" \"Yes, she does.
Berber cut it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna lose it.
Her sister gave her a flu shot.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a cliff cleaning his gutters.
You got something to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help it.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except for yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday's going down on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I had it coming.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something to Mary.
Nothing looks more like a drunkard than a drunkard.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking off his clothes.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks good.
We stopped in Boston.
This is almost working.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The thugs tied his mouth.
Smile to him.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their superiority.
Dan didn't miss a single episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me he wanted me to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
This is where we'll be.
Why do they do that?
I've studied college for four years, and I've never had anything but a poor degree.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was nothing left but ash.
Tom wants every vegetable but a cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his skin.

Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on that.
I was sloppy.
I just saw Tom this past week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom got caught cleaning.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom's taken out two tubes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I've decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish sentences this whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really bad.
Do you want a cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I feel a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is full of wisdom and godliness.

I think we'll join.
Tom leaned forward.

I'm all set.
Do you need any help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is she?
Can people really be so foolish as to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks the Caucasus language, that it has neither common phonems nor common letters with English, can completely overcome English in just two years?

I have something for him.
How do I know Tom's right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.

The students are gone.
That's how much you've done.
Kate is very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.

You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary was.
Watch my fingers.

You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.

I asked you how you were doing.

This is beautiful.
Tom, don't play with Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.

Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.

It seems aimless.
I don't know anything about the future.

The glands produce chemical substances in the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I was providing help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.

It was hot yesterday, but it's more durable today.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not fair to me.
It's possible someone was following them.
Maybe Tom will be going to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a case.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to speak to him.
It's a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He's gone soon.
The children were so excited after the party they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.

And the paper ran out.
Tom can't express himself.
At the meeting.
I'm gonna get a picture of you making a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb flints, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We've been waiting for them outside.
Not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.

It's hers.
That's not really an option.

It wasn't very good.
The mechanics should be understood in oils and motorcycles.

I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I salt my omelette.
Tom explained to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're sick, right?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains irresponsible.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife out.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running to me.
Tom seems very tired right now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
The cells are the basic components of living creatures.
She's being entertained.
I have to go change.
How long have you worked as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
One day after my older sister was born, Chukunbaba died.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much of an appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom was soon lost in the crowd.
For the record, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a leprechaun.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the job we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sex - transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around at the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you shut up when we're kissing?
Somebody's gonna see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was ready to shoot me.
Tom's roaring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the Seed.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I screwed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that ring a bell?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
It's all or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I've come for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly on the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
An hour before the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird raised the branch with the beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same guy three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get free.
What am I gonna be to them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not a good time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not old-fashioned.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did he have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got waved hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's very, very strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
My conscience is biting me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're a big talker.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's got something to do.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I'm paying you my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I fall asleep, I hear music.
I will pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should create a habit of brushing your teeth at every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the King's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could ever imagine.
No one gets hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom keeps climbing up.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What'd they find?
You lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to get involved.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom had done it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
We'd just be in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it all the time.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach, so that's where they spent the day.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little hot, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's about you.
That's a very dry explanation.
Breakfast walks are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them at a place of their choice.
Wasn't it terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They framed him for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt upside down.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
It was a really good dinner!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division isn't.
I'm on it.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom's in a hurry.
It was Bether.
Tom started roaring.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will die in the morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was crazy.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom, relax your arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam has clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
It's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the Al's flag?
Lighten up!
I told you it'd be hard to get it out.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom lasted without food for a week.
I don't get it.
Even though I'm a devout man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we going?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to examine something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you building?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in the meana.
What was Tom like?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I made you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't rustle.
Tom's regained consciousness.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good at it.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and imagination.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the power of will.
Can you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I came by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it already.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of family are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think there's yet a made-up cure for it.
Every member must attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You must let me pass on a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on that subject.
You're a righteous man.
I'll go.
It's my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did he buy Tom gifts?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You dislocated your key bone while you were dancing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was insolent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom is holding on to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the road.
I heard Tom do it like a hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve about it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Time to close.
Leave him to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's out of his mind.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
You don't need to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look horrified.
I could make your job easier.
Hang up the phone.
I'd never get out of my house after a slipper.
I think Tom's a cretin.
The pain of the terrible infection and the ovary and flowed.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It's out of the question.
Tom's heading for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting weird sometimes.
We would have hanged them.
It's probably not a good time for this right now.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What's Tom saying?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapable.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're powerful.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake out of a cappine?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have tons of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even stressful story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language views the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is sacred land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
It's my birthday in July.
We got everything.
How much is one beer?
Tom said he couldn't play tennis.
Where'd you find her?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we left.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you'd found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for demekvres?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you staring at him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathering in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Somebody must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You're making your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little bit involved.
