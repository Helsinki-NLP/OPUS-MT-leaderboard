Members of the Wells National Assembly worry that “they look like maps ”
Some of the congregation members are amazed at the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this could be a subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that his party is concerned that \"it rhymes with Twp and Pwp\"
For those who don't speak Welsh: in Welsh, twp means “stupidest/stupid ” and pwp means “what”
Plaid's member said the party was entirely \"not happy\" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party's actions were \"free-minded\" about changing the name, but noted that the similarity of the MWP and \"mappet\" words is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘w’ is similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter ‘u’
The National Assembly commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: “The final decision on any words to be called members of the congregation will of course, of course, be brought to the members themselves,
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welles congregation the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that indicated strong support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus can cause headaches for the speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will cast the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to \"The Republic of Northern Macedonia\"
The popular vote was set in an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite to change his name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell went down as the Harlem churches face problems
\"Istorially, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,\" Mr. Adams said.
\"Today, there is neither, nor the other,
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
\"People are socializing in another way today,\" he said.
\"Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go regularly.
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings full of types of people who will not help the remaining sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
\"The majority of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white people,\" he said, \"and that's why it's going to speed up the day these churches close completely because it's unlikely that most people moving into those apartments will become members of these churches,\"
The two churches were built by the congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of the blacks – the metropolis community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white-methodists moved out in the '30s.
The convention of black people who practice their faith nearby takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of sellers on 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bell of the poor ”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different: “cultural wealth, ” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument,
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to play a black musician, Dionio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger carillo at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part brought by the unskilled leaders of the church, and part of the Episcopic diocese.
The Church’s Governing Body, composed of unskilled leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese “will demand to transfer the costs to the church board, even though the church board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parish members have complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark hurt 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, the authorized organs said.
The attack took place just seven hours ago near Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that first he thought it was a thrill of catching lobster, but then “he realized that he was yelling,’ he bit me!
You bit me! ”
The entire key bone was visible to him, Hamel said that he had noticed since he reached the boy.
“I cried for everyone to get out of the water: ‘ There is a shark in the water!’ ” Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of Radio in San Diego, he was taken into critical condition.
It is unknown what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach savior, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but they decided that the shark was not of dangerous vision.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the top of the torpedo.
The authorized authorities closed the beach on the side of the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigations and security.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Saintsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty-style shelves full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom that weighs 2,8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household area decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be presented in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty has emerged since supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of shelves once designed for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they would for the first time double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-starting its set of makeup Boutique, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Kraydon, southern London last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and tending to buy smaller foods on a daily basis in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, director of Sainsbury's, said the stores would increasingly look like cattle houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's started putting stores on Argos in hundreds of stores, and he also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they believe increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended up unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement over how to divide profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of his pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to suit any need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying –
Peter Jones “Wheaves - After Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million - pound contract
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Den has gone \"Wheave\" – after TV leader Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11m-pound contract with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly products and household accessories.
The business of the two is linked to the Goop brand of Guinea Paltrow.
This 37-year-old driver of a morning program told Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Dan, withdrawing from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was \"enraged\" -- when a TV golden girl confessed during a tensile meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckingham, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean she no longer has time to devote herself to their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
Business is linked to the Goop brand of Guinean Paltrow and was said to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
As the 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long - term future that would send over the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely off guard.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday, was so close to opening.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products that are ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the morning program leader, one of Britain's most paid stars, could cost the firm millions for large investments in pillow and candlestick products, to clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kappa, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant Mcpartleen as the lead of I'm A Celebrity (I am the star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday \"We do not comment on his business goals –
A serious conversation “and then we fell in love ”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media about commenting on what some would consider to be “unpresidential ” and because it is so positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his voice rewrote as a \"representer of news\"
\"I didn't give up on anything –
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the deuclerisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on dedoclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a \"correspondent response\" from the United States about the early moves of North Korea for disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the rally.
\"We are excellent in agreeing with North Korea,\" he said.
\"We were supposed to be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great cooperation –
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results -- completed rocket samples, helped free hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
\"It is easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we will have 200 people standing right here,\" Trump said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the effects of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no elementary disaster was declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
\"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, which is why it is a challenge,\" said Mr. Sumbung.
Although “Save the Children, ” he is putting together a traveling team in Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of earthquakes that constantly affect Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other shores.
The apparent lack of a siren for a tsunami warning in Palu, although a warning was issued, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, travel through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of displaced homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using swords, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.

\"I saw Cante coming closer and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just shot her.\"
Chelsea led 1-0 half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.

Hazard passed the defense and refined the long-range styre with a left-foot impact near Alison Becker's Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the group phase of the Champions League at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA League Europe at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesia tsunami rose to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in an earthquake of 7.5 which struck Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried with a shot of collapsed buildings.

Cromwell's statue of parliament has become the latest memory blow in the \"scribing history\" dispute.
Its persecution would be a poetic justice for his “Taliban, the destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s Society described Mr. Creek’s proposal as “stupidness ” and“ a copy of history, ”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure would become the target in front of the Western Palace.
The iconoclast of the English civil wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the works of his ancestors, Thomas, in the last century.
The wonderful presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornejcroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people think, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament by external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is a fully accurate performance is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individualized figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning
A pig-killer rips apart and kills a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
A man, identified only by his name \"Juan\" was found dead with a broken artery, covered in blood near the cost of the market in Liupansui in the province of Gicou, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xing in Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door to the neighboring pork joint.
He declared that there was a large boar in the bone with blood on the snout.
The forensic survey confirmed that the boar weighing 550 pounds broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
\"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken up,\" the cousin named \"Wu\" said, according to the quote in Gwayang's evening news.
Security camera footage shows Juan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Juan's family and market managers are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs who attacked humans have been reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as “activator ”
\"They're just playing
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
All you have to do is pay them enough respect, he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest U.S.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain to northern Mexico and the southwest United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a category 1 hurricane from 5.00 east at the time of Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to import a large tropical moisture north into the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, a flow of ruins, and possible soil slides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause rains that will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid floods are possible due to rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert on foot at the possibility of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and storms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
There may be rains of more than half an inch, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Periodic tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning before the rain spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread in “four corners ” on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected to take place everywhere in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical regions remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference will take place in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures in 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christina Blassi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the unprecedented political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted regular switch programmes at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, made a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavano was taking her piano and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, saw it on Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To show better, it's an audience the size of a playoff match in football or film academy awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavanaugh's appointment, led in front of all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the full-time hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS's cameras caught protestors calling him Friday morning while he was trying to get into an elevator for the trial committee's hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes while he was being reproached, all being transferred live to CNN.
\"They stand here before you,\" said a woman.
\"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?
He was told, “You have power, and so many women are powerless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the trial committee was to vote to advance Kavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would review the allegations against the nomination next week, which was asked by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and with a few senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had great significance, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavano without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into all charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for \"playing politics\" on coastline
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for \"playing politics\" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the newspaper's main page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called \"Ceckers – a plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should gather the cost of the mutual is \"fully absurd\"
Wade Sims shooting: police arrest Dieteon Simpson suspect for the death of Louisiana State University athlete
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Sims' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Dietéon Simpson has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB's partner told CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge's pathologist's office published a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head of the neck.
The department thanks to the Louisiana state police refugee unit, the state police crime lab, police at the South University and citizens in the area for their assistance in an investigation that led to the arrest.
At Louisiana State University, the athletic director thanked police for their “activity in search of justice ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot drop grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Louisiana State University basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was “destructed ” and“ in shock, from Sims’ death.
\"This is what you care about constantly,\" the coach said.
The Vulcan casts ashes on Mexico City
The dumping of ashes from the volcano Popotepetel reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go towards the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The centre followed more rumblings and tremors.
The images of social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City settlements, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysics have observed increased volcanic activity 45 miles (72km) south-east of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as \"Don Gojo\" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace, and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint in powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights broke out, and police used their thumbs to suppress fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups have been shouting, \"No forgetfulness, no forgiveness, and on the other hand the union protesters have been shouting, \"Long live Spain,
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalons.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low due to the boycott by people who oppose secession.
According to Catalonia authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police forcefully tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has the chance to gain independence.
\"Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck, he said.
Although they won a vital but close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalonia Independence Party struggled to keep the dynamics of the year with many of their most famous leaders or in self-elected persecution or in custody waiting for trial for their role in organising a referendum and a consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, shooting a police support protest, said the conflict was backed by politicians from both sides.
\"It's getting more and more intense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who is in prison before a trial last year, said he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
\"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the repression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,\" he said.
Londonders: men arrested after driving a car into a house
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years of age, were arrested after repeating a car in a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place at Balinagard Kresent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings said that damage to the gate and the building itself was caused.
At one point, it could have been shot by a crossbow to the car.
Menga's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won.
The advanced Livingston has stepped in the Rangers by signing Steven Gerrard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as club manager Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be significant while Gary Hold's side rose by one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's country has lost its guests in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are behind eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the six-game division, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the cruel guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they scored, and their directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgow could only point his efforts away after he played Craig Halkett's head over the goal by slipping.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play ahead, knowing they could create problems with the actions they set up.
And that's exactly how the judgmental goal came.
The Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who only touched the goal from the center of the 16th.
Until then, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but they couldn't get through the defenses of the hosts, so goalie Liam Kelly, for the most part, didn't play.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score a goal because of the skill of Rangers goalie Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from another action in Livingston.
Livingston's 16 men kept passing and were constantly defended, while two penalty claims - following Halket's challenge for Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for hand play - were rejected.
“Phenomenal – by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and score for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to overcome the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing have hardly changed since their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga was still holding Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on standby.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerrard's leadership, they now fall behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they were able to open the hosts – and it was a small awareness of the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Colonia
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They deteriorated because of problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Colonja to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also said, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protesters reflect the visitor's division celebrated as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat by others.
Car accident on the way to Deptford: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A velosipedist died after a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection on the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, a traffic stop in Deptford, in the southeast of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist died in a car accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled, about a mile from a collision Saturday.
Metro police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Road blocks have been placed and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Hurted in riots · Global Voices
Six prison officers were injured in a riot in a high-level male prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestshire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and still persist.
Special Forces of the tornado unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
The cops were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
Prison spokesman said: \"Specific trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the ongoing HMP Long Lattin incident.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend an extra time behind bars –
HMP Long Lattin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, public order and peace police were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which personnel were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (can be useful for dry areas)
There is rarely a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest region, bringing the risk of a sudden flood.
The State Weather Station has already issued warnings of possible floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, to southern and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station reported in a tweet that only “ten tropical cycles maintained tropical storm status or depression in a 200 - mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border -
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the Arizona area.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Karpesti Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risky flood areas, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain will probably benefit because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Tracking Body, almost 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category, said Ćon.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa led to earth’s sinks all over Mexico’s lower peninsula.
Rosa, still strong on Sunday mornings with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold water in the Pacific and it's dropping.
So rains in Mexico are expected with the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours of Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
\"It is expected that rains from 3 to 6 inches from the lower California to the northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain, \"weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as tropical depression, which will then move upwards across Arizona and in southern Utah until the late hours of Tuesday.
\"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains are the very heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the US Desert Southwest Region, \"said by the State Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and flows of ruins, as well as landslide in mountain regions.
Midsamer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsamer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He has been taken to a hospital and is in “a stable state. ”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the recordings of the incident's cell phone to step forward.
Trump said Kavano \"has suffered the greatest malice and anger of the Democratic Party.
\"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the most cruel and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavano \"has suffered the greatest malice and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassi Ford's accusations of sexual assault several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified at the hearing and on her accusations.
The president said Saturday that \"Americans saw brilliantness, quality, and courage in Cavanaugh that day.
\"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,\" he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavanaugh's nomination as he discussed the significance of Republican turnout in the early elections.
\"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not running, but I am really struggling, he said.
\"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for excellent candidates,
Trump said Democrats have a mission to \"refuse and hinder\"
The first key vote on Kavano's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, GOP senior leader for CNN said.
Hundreds Dead in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims increases
At least 384 people were killed, many were taken away from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves of 6 metres (18 feet) hit the shore of sunset, leading many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5-tight earthquake, it struck a tsunami.
\"When the threat of a tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still performing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the BNPB agency's spokesman for the accident-mediated incident of Indonesia in a briefing in Jakarta.
\"The tsunami did not come on its own, dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the mainland,\" said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos of air released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, rolled and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The consecutive tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Indonesia Technology (BPT) said the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy released from the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as \"dangerous\" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shot of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in a region called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication \"has been completely damaged without any information – by Dongala, Nugroho said.
\"There are more than 300,000 people living there,\" the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,\" they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about at the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared by social media, you can hear a man on the upper floors of a building screaming crazy, warning people on the street down about a tsunami approaching.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami have caused a power failure that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been re-opened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo had plans to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the Indonesia tsunami rose over 800.
It's really bad.
While staff of the World Vision of Dongala safely arrived in the town of Palu, where employees had sheltered themselves from tarpaulins in the courtyard of their office, they walked through scenes of wilderness, Mr. Doseba said.
\"They told me they saw many houses that have been destroyed,\" he said.
It's too bad.
Even as aid groups began the dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign help experts had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"It is still a disaster at the level of the province,\" said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"As soon as the government says, \"Okay, this is a national disaster,\" we can receive international aid, but there is still no status \"
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of missing ones were still hoping that their loved ones would be miracles to facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was trapped under the ground for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglideric state team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia at the beginning of the month.
Others stuck at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
\"As a senior in the field of paragliderism, I have my own emotional burden,\" he said.
Mr. Gendon related how, when he began circulating the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliders' community, he desperately sent whatsapp to the competitions from Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages only ended with a gray sign of checking, rather than a son.
\"I think that means the messages are not delivered,\" he said.
Thieves stole $22.750 when loading ATMs at the \"Newport of the Kay\"
Thieves stole $2,750 from an employee at Bink's on Friday morning, supplementing an ATM at Newport's Newport, according to a Newport Police Station press release.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man “went running from behind the employees of Bink’s ” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses have noticed more suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but police have not given a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identities should contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: The rapper changed his name to J.J.
Rapper Kannee West changed his name to yay.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanja West –
Forty-one-year-old West wore the Yai nickname for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album \"Yandhi\"
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to cancel for \"emotional reasons\" – the show creator said.
Although using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that ‘ej’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means ‘you’,’ said the West at the beginning of the year, discussing the title of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
\"What does it mean I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He moved from Kanjee, which means the only one, to Yey alone, reflects our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are,
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brader Love.
A former West associate, J.Z., also uses his name with or without cartoons and all the big letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico Vice President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that “he would never use the army for the repression of the Mexican people,
The military shot peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time left student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the young Mexicans by providing monthly help to those who study and open several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States needs to double the field research funds, said the investor and practical for AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the United States government issued statements of artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number one in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
\"The doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence,\" Li said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order – (Supersils in Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the '80s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American suit player, and later was director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Li thanked her for previous matches following US government technology as the challenge in robotics of the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in Defence and asked when the next match would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to obtain state grants, Lee said.
\"It is not China that takes academic leaders, it is corporations,\" Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work for artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
\"I think \"green cards\" should be automatically offered to doctors of science after artificial intelligence,\" he said.
The National Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organisations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is to cover industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of an AUSC.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called \"AI Next\"
As for NSF, they currently invest over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation requiring the creation of a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence had been out of action for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requirements for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and vetoes its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycotting campaign has questioned whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for validity in the referendum.
The question of the referendum note was: \"Do you wish to join NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece --
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow bodies such as the EU and NATO to enter Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
\"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,\" said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change its name.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
\"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,\" said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in Macedonia's referendum on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
Ahead of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawadarkov, prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back door,\" Kawadarkov said.
\"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration –
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
\"I believe the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result \"yes\" would be \"confirming our future\"
The poll, released last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Thelma, found 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would have been the first serious blow to the pro-West government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has passed Brighton's entire defense goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Ethiopia Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received an environment in the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three Brighton defence players before entering open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four - green -
Round a defensive player before running a few others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then passed on to the left of it, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first coming to the 16th to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right side of the net.
\"Aguero has leg problems,\" City Manager Pep Gvardiola told reporters.
\"We talked about playing 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that point –
But the initial advantage of “the blue heavens ” gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister of the League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before he took Sterling to the far post.
The attack on “the blue heavens ” brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a competition by the League of Champions on Tuesday at the Rein-Nekar Arena, Germany.
Shercher wants to play a spoiler against Rocky.
Because Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still implications for a playoff for the Rockis team, which runs with a competition in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rocky’s team had at least a \"joker\" for a 5-2 victory spot over Nationals Friday night, but they are still struggling to determine their place in the first division.
\"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any moment I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
Nationals still have to announce a starter in a week, but they are reportedly inclined to let Shercer throw in such a situation.
Shercer, who starts in the 34th time, has trained to throw on Thursday and throws usually rested on Sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18 - 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 straight points in 220 2/3 in this season.
Mints for Trump, West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation regarding Brett Cavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court as he discussed the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
\"Everything we've done so far will be put on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the great, great - I do not run, but I do fight, so I am everywhere fighting for excellent candidates, he said.
Trump continued, \"You are looking at these terrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using whatever means are available to them, seeing wickedness, rudeness.
They don’t care who they hurt, when they have to run over to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we won’t give them –
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to \"refuse and hinder\"
\"And you see it in the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"angry, wicked, rude, and untruthful,
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the ranks of the Democrats, set up by the Senate Court Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with shouts of disdain.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute - that was a very bad body speech - the worst body speech I've ever seen -
Labs no longer accept different opinions.
Those who speak their minds are not tolerated
When the current activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am the last in line of members of parliament from the Labour Party to which we are told that we are not welcome – only because he is expressing his opinion.
My colleague-parlementary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he takes a firm stand against anti-semitism.
In my case, the censorshipist movement criticised me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironicly similar issues Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Eastern Labour Party of Nottingham stated that \"We want meetings to be inclusive and productive,
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party, council meetings Friday night were exactly the same.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of “relieving, more important, ” politics long ago forgotten, if indeed, has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged whether they are acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when I felt that we had previously shared a similar political opinion they had expected me to completely change my mind and take positions that I would never otherwise take, whether it was national security or the EU's internal watch.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media calling for a conviction, a denial of downtown policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this kind of experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great fear of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuse every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every requirement to \"do not trust ” or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrower.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years by keeping my head down, not being so loud, and then “It’s gonna be all right. ”
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the carelessness of Thatcher’s government, which literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday's request, all I want to say is that when the country is forced to Bregzit to harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Tsekum, but about my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how judgmental threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I consider to be in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderful partying match on the day of Scotland's football Championship.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
Finally, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as to their improved use of opportunities, carried by the domestic team, and Coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
\"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy,\" he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose stated: “Presenting for Air has made better use of their chances than we have.
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Klimo, gave favour to Air, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by Voriors, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagg has won an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Air's leadership with a penal, earlier, exactly halftime, and he scored a point, converting a solo point to reach 17-5 for the Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose had a good start on the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by Bagg, has reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, which was carried on the stretcher and, from the beginning, Air continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDowell, converted by Klimo.
Air Commander Blair McPherson then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for an extra man with an unconverted Bruce Colvin point at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team also recovered when Struan Hachinson received a yellow card to bring down Klimo without the ball, McPherson pulls a tacduan from the foam line on the back of the Ayr sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Roe took the hit of David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.

\"The sea is ours –: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an undercover naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up sea blue flags.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the motto: “Our sea is rightly ours.
It is its duty to return to us,
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the memory of the shore lost in behalf of Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is longing for a resurgence in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
\"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,\" said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court's decision on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule on behalf of Bolivia's lawsuit that after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Here, Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of native origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also very much depends on Monday's verdict.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean – he was solemnly told at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in the favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even if it decides in their favor.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to assign territory to Chile and stated it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final argument suggests that the case “was not complicated, ” said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have taken Bolivia’s cause back instead of improving it.
\"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes,\" Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia \"an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile – and an opportunity to \"end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit\", he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, another of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as political support.
\"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,\" he added.
\"The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past\"
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur if it cannot trust the United States of America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday outside the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong Un.
Rie says it is a “fiction, ” to be seen as continuing sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of end of the Korean war will bring Severna Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first to take significant measures to disarm.
And Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But there is great scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal the country is probably seeing as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
Paris fashion shows the latest line of massive hats on the way to the largest shops near you.
If you want to improve the size of your cap collection or completely block the sun, then do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the fashion week in Paris.
Finally, impractical hats started Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations that fell into the eyes of the runway.
The piece pointed out by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide-ranging, feathered, head of the model.
The other too large additions included watermelons with circuses, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they were not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving equipment completely with eyeglasses and a diving tube, and another looked like a melted root ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style followers predict that huge hats can come to shops near you.
The large hats came much faster after \"La Bomba – the straw hat with a wide range of two feet worn by all from Rijana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread through the social media sent another large creation after the runway, a huge bag of beach size almost equal to the height of the model that it dragged.
The dark orange Rafija bag, with a rafter board and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquesmus on the fashion week in Paris.
Famous styler Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland hold academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only stepped up by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community commitments.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, a career chosen by their post as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages remain popular and wanted as an election object in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he will do so in a polite way.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build connections and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can note that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of –5+ –
The data, collected from 74 schools at SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of “5+ – after Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved “5 ”
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' programmes, as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the Commission on Employment and Skills of the OC in 2014 noted that the reasons why employers failed to fill jobs were 17 percent due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give polyglob to competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough, and the French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, that is, 15 percent of people.
As a result, investing in language training is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those in developing economies, will provide children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important in the OK when viewed in the future by 2020 as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the interests of your child, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future will bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “International Communications Skills, ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
‘Il faut bien le faire (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will take the Lakers to a debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait almost ended for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first match in the preseason on Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But for how many minutes it will play, it has not yet been decided.
\"It will be more than one and less than 48,\" Walton told the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote a tweet that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
\"I don't need games in the pre-season in this phase of my career to prepare,\" he said.
Channel on YouTube for a rally at Trump, West Virginia
President Donald Trump has started a series of rallies as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five scheduled rallies of Trump next week, including visits to favors such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his choice to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans can lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is the Trump rally tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch it online?
Trump rally in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 pm. Time zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live online on YouTube.
This week is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominated by the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, who has become tense because of allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected delay in the Senate vote by a week, while the FBI's investigation continues.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help the Republicans get a swing for the November elections.
Hence, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies next week are aimed at \"inciting volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives – according to Reuters.
\"The Congress's control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible at the beginning of the difficult season of the campaign, \"a spokesman from Trump's campaign for Reuters, who refused to be named.
Scheduled at the Vesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally may attract supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro news.
On Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won by more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in polls.
\"It is not good for Morrisi that the president must come to improve the popularity of polls,\" said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cooper Ryder 2018: US team shows courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the beginning of individual competitions Sunday
After three unilateral seasons, four on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The trickery of happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would say happiness is now?
\"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're lucky, I guess,\" Jordan Spitt said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage of, of course, four-point lead and twelve more games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails even though they have a sufficient incentive, if anything else then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points of four.
Spit was excellent, leading by example.
Those strong shouts of celebration became more and more powerful during his game, with a key blow that led to a level of four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His stroke won the 15 game was welcomed with a similar cry, by telling you that he believes the American team is not out of play.
\"You simply have to deepen and take care of your competition,\" Spit said.
That's all every player has right now.
18 points to score.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesca Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Cup Ryder.
Strangely enough, the beautiful duo of Europe is four out of four and cannot be wrong.
\"Molliwood -- they were the only couple with no bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they dodged bad blows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the previous nine on Friday morning.
It series and the way it seems to run their energy to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's preferred for both of us at the same time at different holes.
However, talks on European glory remain unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning double couple hero, when he joined Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they never made it out of.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch at close range because of the interaction between their partners, the advice they give, the advice they fail to listen to, and the way strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant leadership on the last day, but the Four Season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, suspected.
Europeans lead 10-6 on Buy Ryder's last day
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of Cup Ryder after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and fours from 10-6 in front of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far on Le Golf Nation at four points.
Thomas Björn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy you lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the US team that had many failures in morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans put up more resistance to the four, winning two matches, but they couldn't get to the leadership.
Jim Furik’s team needs eight points from the 12 individual games Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed \"Molliwood\", after the sensational weekend, are the second couple in general to score four points in the first four games in Cup Ryder history.
After having been crushed, Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the worn-out Woods and US rookie Bryson Dechambu with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who made it through two swords on Saturday, played great for moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning double couples, returned as a partner to Henry Stanson in the 2 & 1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kotka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, Europeans did not follow that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for the Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spanish, John Rahm and Ian Pulter in double pairs, and later returned to defeat Pulter and Rory McLeroy with 4&3 in four, but lost to the original, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a certain team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as bearings of the title, Furik’s team was satisfied with the same result to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says that “there is no chance of disarming unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took “substantial measures of goodwill ” last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing itself against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\" Nevertheless, we do not see an appropriate answer by the United States,\" he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first –
Although Rie reiterated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament “in phases, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri alluded to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first summit in general of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed himself to work towards “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, ” while Trump granted a guarantee of North Korea's security.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to yield to strict international sanctions on North Korea.
\"The United States insists on \"nuclear disarmament above all else – and increase the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion and even by \"the declaration of end of war\", Rhi said.
\"The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust,
Rhee did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not end up in such a dead end,
Even so, the tone of Ree’s speech was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the U.S. Land was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President - Trump called Kim - Raquetar, a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “fully destroy ” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that many things remain to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying \"Do it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter –
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking steps.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"The Security Council sanctions must continue fully and without exceptions until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed.\"
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but he was denied by North Korea only after hours due to “gangster demands ”
North Korea committed to meeting with Moon this month for disarming a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes “proper measures, ”
He said Kim told him that \"the appropriate measures -- which he is looking for are the security guarantees Trump has made in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night with caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about basic self - care.
Charles Chaser, a professor of medical science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“ At the end of the lecture a girl came and said to me: “Why are you telling me this now, in the last year, ”
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me – he told me about the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic results and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of health services at the university said the university has decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a student home where students press on coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how the long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, then urges participants to consider their daily routine.
\"We know that it will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the effects on health when you choose to smoke a cigarette – Professor Chaser added.
The culture of pride with \"work all night\" still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep shortages are an increasing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be “the secret weapon ” of the student in the fight against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Caisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “the blue light, ” which is broadcast from electronic screens and LED light, which moves the circus rhythm, leading to problems with sleepiness.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal brought down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Stephen Gerrard's decommitted team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The Aybrox team wanted to register its first victory after February's 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team took the second defeat of the Gerrard team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the rogue top team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers position lost inspiration and chance of evenness.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston has gone third, and they're only behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
There could be additional problems waiting for the Rangers after Linen Judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention for head trauma after being obviously hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that spent Air in the semifinals of Cup Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 Livingston scores that scored with Harts last week and would be happy the way his well-trained position was choking opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more with the ball than they do.
They were supposed to score, two minutes after Menga's first playoffs pushed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed his chance.
Then a blow from a distance to Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was to receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute that he and Steven Lawles collided, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not approve of the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but the former Aybrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not struggle with the head-butt of Lasana Kulibali and the weak blow of these Edarias.
Although the beginning of Livingston's 34th minute may have been contrary to the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga as a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from her blockade line.
But Livingston was able to attract guest players to play the game they enjoy, with Litgow and Hackett caught many of the long additions.
Holt's team was able to extend the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor was well placed and prevented Jacobs before Litgow played head by corner.
The Rangers replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty request since he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't approve again.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now one side of our almanac “On Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and WE DEFINITE... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become the main stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 movie “The Colorado Bell, in which those seemingly unconvincing, cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are performing:
Man: “What is it again?
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the earpieces on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactive activity in minerals.
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now –
\"Hans – Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery bearing his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” alien cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” alien cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their changes to the laboratory
You can “see ” a protein honor in many cancers and then return to the body
The trial vaccine produces promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells, Ovarium cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, their changes to the laboratory, so that they can “see ” the protein of honor in many types of cancer called HER2, and then return to the system.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer of Bethezda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.
HER2 “produces the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarium, lung, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and their “leukemia ” - how to target cancer cells works when treating certain types of leukemia.
Kanjee West made a pro-Tramp drop, wearing a drop with his motto, after the show on Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanjee West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast on Saturday night, following a useless performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called Ghost City, where he wore a drop of inscription to make America Slavna again, he began criticising the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ Often when I talk to a white man, they say: “How do you like Trump, he is racist,
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago, ” he said.
Saturday night's live show began satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Commission, related to allegations of a sexual assault on Christine Blassie Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's outburst was posted on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had hardly passed the stage because of his drop.
\"Beyond the scene they made fun of me.
They told me “don’t show up with that drop ”
They made fun of me!
Then they told me that I was in the underworld, he said, according to Washington-Eczeminer.
The news continued: “You want to see the sunken place, ” you said, “put your superman hat on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try loving - kindness
His comments drew resentments from the audience at least twice, and the team of the evening show seemed embarrassed, Barateti reported, a man told the publisher: “The entire studio goes on,
The news was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many with a performance of the song “I Love It, ” dressed as a bottle of Perrier’s.
West received support from the leader of the TPSAD conservative group, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for being a part of the crowd,
But the host of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was her own and it was absolutely wonderful –
\"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his \"art\") for which I believe he accepts and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we, she added.

The star of the series Troll Game, Keith Harrington, has attacked toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like Jon Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of Trolls Games.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be firm to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Kit said he believed that \"something is wrong\" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #Now I say.
Kit, who recently married a star from the Tronos Game, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having “powerful feelings ” on the subject.
\"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where have we sinned with manhood?\" he said.
“ What we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now,
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity, thanks to the strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate but what is taught?
What is taught from TV, and what on the street, makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it is obvious that something is wrong with young men –
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in continuations of the Tronoi Game when the show ends next summer, saying that “it ended with battles and horses ”
Since November, Kit will be performing a restoration of the real West of Sam Shepherd, a story of a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of the Trolls Game.
\"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me my future family and my life in the future,\" he said.
Rose played the Games, a guy who had a love attraction with Keith's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that Amy won.
The girl married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new events were transmitted through sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people who have had HIV this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the Yunan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people in the LGBT community is high.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies show that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data supplied by a member of staff associated with a Republican Party senator as “dangerous lies ” and“ conspiracy theories, ”
US Representative Maxine Waters rejected Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information on three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia lawmakers' pages.
The Democratic of Los Angeles has convinced that claims are on the \"ultra-right – sympathizers and websites\".
\"Lyings, lies and even more disgusting lies,\" Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly includes US Senators Lindsay Graham's home address and phone numbers from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate hearing panel of allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court judge.
The reported information appeared shortly after Cavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redsteit have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the post is linked to the Waters office and information about a member of Waters personnel has been published, Hill reported.
\"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie, as Waters continued.
\"The membership of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information presented.
Unfortunate accusations are a complete false and absolute lie,
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
\"These denials are nervous,\" wrote Fleisher.
\"This shows that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be provoked.
He must not ask about the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats associated with Judge Cavanaugh, who was indicted by critics for looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm election, also tweeted.
\"If true, it's a big thing,\" he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified \"supervised institutions and police of false claims.
\"We will allow the offenders to be discovered – she continued, \"and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff,
The thought of Johnny English attacks again - undermines Rowan Atkinson's spy fraud
It is now traditional to look for elements of Bregzit in every new British-related film, and that seems to be true of this restoration of the female fraud, action comedy Johnny English -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: born again.
Will careful self - ridicule on the subject of how clearly we are for nothing be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In spite of that, the large - eyed face and many faces of the incompetent Johnny English got a license to “fry things up a second time - his name indicates, above all, that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for movie viewers in places where English is not spoken.
He's certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamour after a bit like Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bean and a part of the boy who plays a note from the Kochii song on fire from the opening ceremony of the London Games.
His foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson, who once performed in the now-forgotten TV commercial of Barclays, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor’s fins hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift of physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since “the serious“ film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children instead of adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as innovative and focused as the silent tricks of the Atkinson character.
The subject of all this is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated a top secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the disappointment of the agent on duty -- a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a more ambitious and combat figure and already suffers from a complete melt of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best in this Quasi-Terreza-Mei character, but there is nothing special about the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence counselors have informed her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling on Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but “in black ” gives secret agents classes: there are a couple of good guys here when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
Ingles has been called to Whitehall for immediate briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all the King's Secret Service stuff, they come back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
Ingles and Bow begin their odyssey in absurd actions: rearranged as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; make a wasteland once they sneak themselves into the luxury yacht of Walt; and Ingles begins a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet as a virtual reality to get acquainted with the inside of the Volta house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as much as it's kind and noisy, there's a lot of kids' TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And like other movies with Johnny English, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Labourists deny making plans for British workers to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week -- but they will be paid in five.
The party allegedly wants company heads to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give another day off to workers.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea \"answers\" with the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be more inclined to workers.
The four-day work week transition is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A highly ranked party member told Sunday Times: \"The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
\"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy \"
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated for a four-day working week during a campaign for parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, aspirations have not been accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: \"The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea --
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of \"directors without a face\" and \"profittors\" in utility companies.
Plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could do \"deductives\" because of unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company's board and to create Inclusive Property Funds, making 10 per cent of the private company's capital belonging to employees, who can take annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy make a statement about \"60 Minutes\" on whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least a week and has been updating the question of whether the findings of the bureau may reconsider some Republican senators' withdrawal of support.
In an interview published on Sunday, “60 Minutes’ correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I think of course,\" Kennedy said.
\"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out and I said, \"Did you do it?
He was firm, determined, incomprehensible,
Graham's voice, however, looks like he's carved into stone.
\"My decision has been made for Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied energy,\" Graham added, referring to Christine Blacey Ford.
\"Everyone she appointed could not confirm.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Civic Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Civic Festival will be held in New York City, an annual musical event that features famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held seven times, and the Global Citizens festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civic Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for VIP ticket), participants have to meet several tasks or “actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Golbalen citizen because they remain 12 years to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert the right way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of \"click-activism\" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed that they have registered more than 19 million “activities ” from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to indicate commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and hints as a result of their activities, of which $10 billion have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have a direct flow of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of the Food, a partnership of investors and implementrs based in Britain, dedicated to \"helping children exploit their potential\" -- which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with insufficient food in the country after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
\"With support from the government of Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition, a note in history,\" said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of the Food, ahead of the gathered people at a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been taken over calls for improving the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government has announced financing of the project, the Power of Ichranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their website \"Why do you think you can end extreme poverty –
The Global Citizens responded: “It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will not succeed.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wicend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy as a \"blockade\" to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington may \"as long as necessary\" to use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki quoted Washington as saying.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria -- namely, where it acts upon the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a cover for exploring new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the market for energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe – he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
\"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea roads remain open and if it is necessary by blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market,\" he said.
Zinki addressed those attending an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a nonprofit group representing itself as “the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noticing that he was effectively the same.
\"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing fuels,\" he said, while talking about Russia as a \"one awkward pony\" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the \"inadequate - pipeline project North Tech 2, which, according to Trump, has made from Berlin a “conqueror - Moscow. ”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is just for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,\" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our supply of energy,\" said Dieter Kemp, the first man in the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren \"will carefully consider whether to run for president in 2020, said Senator from Massachusetts
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday that she \"will carefully consider whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the Holiock City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on the forehead, she said, according to Hill.
\"After November 6th, I will carefully consider running for president,
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the city hall and said he \"led the country in the wrong direction.
\"I'm too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,\" she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as the Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren said \"of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote\"
A poll, however, published Thursday showed that many voters in her constituency think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of \"probable\" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination, and 48 per cent against it.
Other known names from the Democratic Party discussed about the 2020 nomination include former Deputy President Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Treck Paylin's traumatic syndrome at a Donald Trump rally.
Trek Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up for September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night
\"With what my son is going through, what he's been going through since he got back, I know how other families feel about post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,\" she said in front of the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest \"a elephant in the room\" and said that her son and other war veterans \"they are returning a little different, they are coming back solid, they are coming back and wondering if there is any respect for what they and their friends from the air force, and every other member of the military gave it to the country,\"
He was arrested Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Vassila.
18 federal states, Washington City support challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support a challenge to a new US policy that prevents asylum on victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington City submitted a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seekers who challenge politics, Ann-Bi-Si News reported.
The entire prosecutor's name in the Grace case against parliament, which the American Civil Freedom Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said that her partner \"and the violent members of his gang\" abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum claim on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where many asylum demands in the United States originate, as nations with ongoing gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has canceled the Immigrant Appeals Board's 2014 decision, which has allowed uncommented immigrants who are fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Attorney General Carl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy \"regrets decades of law-making at the level of federal states, federal and international levels\"
\"The federal law requires that all asylum requests be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle, according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the defenders in the letter argue that policy preventing immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs \"to offer the needed workforce,
Attorney General Jeff Seschns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic gang abuse and violence in June.
\"There is an asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear over race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\" Sesns said in the June 11th presentation of politics.
The asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
A desperate rescue effort is being made in Palu because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
\"It is very tense,\" said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby at the evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
\"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water.
Residents return to their ruined homes and choose from their guided objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside for frequent consecutive minor earthquakes.
Tears came into his eyes when he described the massive earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think, ” Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
\"I heard the wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of \"maltering – with \"propaganda commercials\"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four sides of an American daily newspaper listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's payment allowance in De Moin Registerer -- the most-selling newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US elections for the November 6th congress, China rejected the charge.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked by US services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a commercial war that is leveling import tariffs with each other.
China's revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed towards exporters from federal states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstadt, the US ambassador to China and formerly, longtime governor of Iowa, chief agricultural producer in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, \"now doubles the abuse of propaganda ads in our free press –
\"In the demining of propaganda, the government of China abuses the gentle American tradition of free speech and free media by posting ads in De Moin Registerer,\" Branstad wrote.
\"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
He added that \"one of China's most read newspapers rejected his offer of publication – on the column, although he did not say what paper it was about.
Republicans move away from women's votes ahead of mid-term elections due to Kavano debaclet, analysts warn
With many Republicans silently watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh's nomination at the Supreme Court despite several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially of women in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already been declared to want to continue voting.
From such things there is no turning back, ” said Grant Richer, a professor of political sciences at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubts that pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake's FBI (Arizona Republican) would be enough to appease angry voters.
\"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November,\" said Karin Jean-Pier, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protestors shouted, \"Noemvri is coming -- when a protest in the hall of the Senate, when Republicans, who are in control of the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue Cavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blazie Ford's testimony, Mick said.
\"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high,\" said Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
\"People already say they are high; that is true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony with her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggest there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
\"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party,\" said former president Michael Steel of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to news from the En-Bi-Si.
\"It is not only about voting in the commission or the final vote or whether Kavano will go to the hearing, it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it, \"the director of the United States Prioritys, a group that helps with the democratic election, the news channel.
However, Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, although most accept the first-time side.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably trust Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent stated that they thought Cavanaugh was probably or definitely lying on the stand, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
After Fleek's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating charges made by Ford, as well as at least one others, at Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before a Senate legal issue committee, sworn in last week that Kavano had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses that the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to launch new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Network inventor starts with a start-up business that pretends to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legend project in technology, Inrapt, is a company that was built on the Solid Open platform, by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li joked that Inrupt’s intention was “world domination ”
\"We have to do it now,\" he said of starting-up business.
\"Now is the historic moment –
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own Internet-based data store or a shortened POT.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Sleck and Spotify to all be available to one viewer at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data store on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a particular type of information.
The company calls it “personal reinforcement through data ”
The idea of Inrapt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company will provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by the IBM, several development programmers with a project and community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralisationd applications using tools available at the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
\"We are not asking their permission,
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Ly wrote that \"the mission of Inrapt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of the World Technology Institute's World Network in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I am a great optimist for the new internet era,\" Burners-Li added.
Bernard Van: Famous Bear of the Victorian Cross of World War I · Global Voices
The only priest of the Church of England who received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.

The fans of the combined martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Pig
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Belator 206, without having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The list from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six with the main card shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., only Gerard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain became appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Prse.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours for the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the transfer of children’s cartoons as “a painful joke, ”
\"The law is that at 6 a.m., that content was inadequate, so it had to be transferred to a children's programme,\" said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Belator for Marketing and Communications, when asked about the transfer.
- ‘ Pepa Pig - Yes -
Company President Belator Scott Kucker said they will work on a schedule that will include British viewers in the future.
\"I think that when I think about releasing again, I think we can probably find a solution,\" Kuker said.
\"But there is six o'clock Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we received many messages when we transferred, and none of them were gracious.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of the fans, and we overdid.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a desert island: Tom Daley felt “inferiority ”
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that \"they're not all like me\"
Speaking on the first show Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give “hope ” to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
Regular presentation of the longtime Kirsti Young show took a months’ rest for illness.
Appearing as a parallel figure in Laverne’s first program, Daley said that he felt “less than anyone else growing up because“ it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls, ”
He said: “To this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that not everyone would be disappointed when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The Olympic man with two bronze medals became a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's World of Australia Games to appeal more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - \"surprises me –
Daley made a marriage to the Oscar, who was 20 years older last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
\"When you go through so much at an early age -- he went to the first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it's hard to find someone at the same age who's experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that \"all his views\" had changed.
\"As long as you asked me last year, everything was connected to \"I should win a gold medal,\" he said.
\"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie-
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept death and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him \"you wouldn't be here to be in the front row,\" he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible, ” he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
\"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life -- to jump in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling,\" he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - pride from Heather Small - that turned to his head in preparations for the Olympics and from which he was still trying.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 are Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikaelson, the horse is out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Cup Ryder contest, but he will have to change his shape to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michelson, who plays at the biennial event, the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double pairs and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of attention, as often represented by the United States, the five - time winner, he divided the time to cheer and practice his game, the range, with the hope of correcting what is more difficult.
He was never the best leader, not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the tight court Le Golf National, where distant rough blows are a regular punishment for carelessness.
And if the pitch itself is not scary enough, Michelson, in the ninth match Sunday, faces the precise British Open French Molinari champion, who plays double with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michelson's game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
\"He fully understands the role he has played today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he will be ready tomorrow,\" Furik said.
\"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the famous and has given much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went away and we thought it was what we had to do.
He likes to dance, just like everyone else -
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup's most played games on Sunday.
It can be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he likes to joke with people, and he's a great man at team meetings, he explains.
\"I think the younger players had fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game –
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the European captain, has learned from experience that a significant leadership in front of individual competitions on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfettered position.
The tax debuted at a competition in Walderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but “they crossed the line of goal only with their noses, with the slightest lead of 141-2-131-2.
\"I remember myself that we had a great lead in Walderam; we had a great lead in Brooklyn when we also lost in Walderama, when we won for a little while, \"Björn said, paintingly, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead from Le Golf Nasional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This is not over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, which is to try and win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
I say all the time, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opponent side - the best players in the world –
Bjorn added satisfied with the results of his golfers: “I don’t want to give early grades on the issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We have individual games ahead of us tomorrow, which is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the skills are tested as a golfer.
That's the message that's supposed to be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he needs to do his best –
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they did in couples, exceptions are Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who won three points than four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up a loser when Europe performed \"The Miracle in Medina\"
\"I remember every word there,\" he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
\"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment moves in a certain direction, it carries a lot of pressure in the middle competitions.
We set up the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow--
Thomas was given the task of countering first and facing Rory McLeroy the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
\"I've decided to do this kind of thing with the boys because I think that's how we're going to cover it all up,\" Björn said about choosing individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete military ships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until next year at least because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
Delivering the \"Rinland-Falz\" – the leading ship of the new class of frigates Baden-Vitemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the daily Di Cate, calling for a spokeswoman of the military.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic issues after delivery prevented the fate of an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Vitemberg class ships the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by old Bremen frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth-technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Other important features include less maintenance -- it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
Nevertheless, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power across the oceans -- will be already outdated by the time they enter the service, notes Di Cate.
The frigate of unfortunate F125 came to the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to a shipbuilding facility after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media are quoting a number of key \"software and hardware defects\" that made the military ship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Vitemberg class would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of older Bremen frigates.
It also turns out that the ship is drastic over the planned weight that reduces its performance and restricts the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
\"Rinland-Faltz\" weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- a rise from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings of Germany's reduced naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Petersen Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy's \"were running out of ships that can be deployed\"
The representative said the problem worsened over time, since the old ships have been withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships have been secured.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Vitemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust Servants the Secret Life of Bats
A new survey of properties in the Scottish mountain districts is being carried out to reveal how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future protection activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano-lily, as well as the brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in Inveru Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
En-Eich-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on bat type.
Then a housing map will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a nature counsellor in En-Ti-Es, hopes to find out what areas of living are most important to bats and how they use each of the species.
Such information will help determine the benefits of living management, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects beds and the loss of habitats.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky fly bands and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
Yet, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Ess, who cares about more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bats reserve in Scotland at Triv estate in Damfris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is ideal territory for them.
\"Here in Triv we have a great area for bats,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, very old two and very good habitats.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to make progress –
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are available before real estate renovations are carried out because unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or harass or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in the Trust for the protection of bats, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and other species of ours, we just don’t know how they live.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers will sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape accusations \"false news\" and added that people \"want to promote themselves\" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with the rape of an American woman named Katherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the accusations were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as “false news –
\"No, no, no, no, no.
The false news has been presented today, the five - time gold ball winner said to his camera.
\"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine - you added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they called “an unacceptable transfer of suspicions from private life, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player would seek damages for \"moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years\".
Apparently, the incident subjected to accusations took place in June 2009 at a hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed by the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent, ” a“ good boy, ” but he gave in under that “one percent, ”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial agreement because she was afraid of revenge, and she was worried “that she would be publicly humiliated ”
The 34-year-old says she is now demanding that the treaty be adjusted because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he moved to Italy's Juventus giant with a 100m-euro deal.
Bregzit: Britain \"will always mourn – lost by car manufacturers
Britain \"will always mourn -- if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Bregzit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was \"awesome\" -- that Toyota-Britanya had told the BBC, that if Britain left the EU without an agreement would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Darby.
\"We need a deal,\" said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border congestion in the event of Bregzit without a deal would cost jobs.
The Burnston factory -- produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
\"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a cutoff of production at our factory,\" said Marvin Cook, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain voiced concern about how cross-border trade will function without an agreement, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-em-we, for example, says he's gonna close his mini-factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the logistics chain risks in case of Bregzit without a deal.
Toyota's production line works according to the system \"right on time\" where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at a border which, according to industry, could cause delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily supply of inventory at the derbyshire factory, the company said, and production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was \"exactly designed to avoid such border checks\"
\"We should have a deal. We should have the best deal that will enable us not only to succeed in enjoying the present but rather to seize this opportunity, \"he told Radio 4's programme today by the BBC.
\"The evidence not only from Kyoto, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains,
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned long-term that additional costs would reduce the industry's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Covlaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the factory union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “As soon as those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to one government spokesman: “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU –
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again White House statement
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be \"delayed for another week\" -- as the fight continues over Brett Kavano's nomination as Supreme Court judge, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential violations of laws by the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy public defender and thereby endanger Miller's independence, he has been incited gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was thinking of wearing a camera to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But by publishing reports last Monday, he went to the White House intending to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that “I would not want to ” dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a conflict at the Senate Justice Committee which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blazie Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI about lawsuits against Cavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sara Sanders appeared on “Fox News Sunday –
At the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet established, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things are going, and I always try to keep the seal properly informed,
Some journalists contest the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Principal Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of briefings is not due to an \"great influence\" of television journalists, although he added: \"I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact,\"
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
\"The president organizes more sessions of questions and answers from any president before him, \"she said, adding without giving evidence: \"We have considered those numbers,
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but \"if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President's questions, it's far better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often, and you're witnesses that we've been doing it over the last few weeks, and the talks with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists --
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences on a visit to senior officials.
He seldom participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is the case with its uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system regarding fears related to Bregzit
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and desire that they remain after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, an MP to the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering expenditures for resolved EU status applications working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, aimed at making the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I value the contribution of each member of the work staff, regardless of his citizenship.
Colleges from across the EU and widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are useful for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here –
Christian Abercrombies subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
Cristion Abercrombie, the defensive player of the \"Tenseee State Tigers\" was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury Saturday when the team lost 31-27 of the \"Vanderbilt Commodores\", says Mike Authority of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury took place just before the halftime.
\"He has reached the sideline of the playground and is only scraping on the ground,\" Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in a stretcher and carried it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of \"WSMV\" in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had exited an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center,
Harris added that \"there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury – and \"Tensesee State\" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abbecrombie is a second-year student and plays her first season in a red jersey in the Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five gatherings Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 gatherings this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
Under Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
move to neutralize Korbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120m pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises of providing affordable housing and focusing on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional resources strengthening the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that besides the current administrative fee includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property intended to rent it could reach three percent.
The ministry expects the move to add up to 120m pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London have been purchased by non - United Kingdom residents, leading to price hikes and caused difficulties for those buying property for the first time involved in the process of buying property for housing.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “cities of spirits, ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This new policy was announced only weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of offering high-cost properties that keep the land, but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change the access home quotas in order to repair \"the embarrassing house situation - in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including control of the rent and ending the migrations for no good reason.
He also wants the advice to give greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiere to the return of the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to buy homes in the same easy way as the hardworking British inhabitants.
The dream of owning your own home for many has become too distant, and the humiliation of the homeless has become too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland,
Jack Ross, head of \"Sunderland\" said his \"final ambition\" is in the future to become manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scottishman, 42, enjoys the challenge of resuscitation of the northeast club, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to \"The Light Standard – After returning \"St. Mirren\" back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last season.
\"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was that, ” Ross told Scotland-based “Sportsound, ” the BBC
\"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in \"Hampden\" with my father and always something dragged me back.
Such an opportunity, however, could only be gained if I was successful in managing the club –
Some of Ross’ predecessors as the manager of “Sunderland ” are Dick Advokat, David Moys, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former head of “Alloa Athletic ” says he felt no concern knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club, after having previously rejected offers from “Barnsley ” and “Ipswich Town ”
\"My success at the moment is assessed by \"can I return this club to the Prime Minister League\"
Given the structure and facilities in this club, he no doubt belongs to the Prime Minister’s League, ” he said.
\"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I get the club back there.\"
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, in which he entered his career after working as an assistant to his chief at Dumbarton, and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coaching staff,
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the third league’s decline and return “St. Mirren ” from the brink of losing title in the World Cup in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in \"Clyde\".
\"It was probably a crossroad for me, \"he remembers the takeover of \"Alloa,
\"I honestly believed that career as manager was the right choice for me, better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough of it, and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I'm still going through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good as a manager.
I always wanted to be a manager and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in this role than ever during my entire adult life.

According to one study, the perfect beer time is at 5:30 on Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs that are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the company CGA, for business consulting services when setting these numbers, said: “Sunday time and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup, meant that the situation in July was similar to that of June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants decreased significantly.
The 1.8 per cent drop in restaurants in June has worsened further in July.
The pubs and bars where drinks are mostly sold have seen a much greater increase compared to previous years compared to restaurants where a decline was observed.
The pubs in which food was mostly sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to get a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month and the sale of food by just three percent.
Paul Newman, a holiday and hospitality analyst from \"RSM\" said: \"These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, although the decrease in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly devastating as a complement of the current pressures generated by costs.
The long warm summer could not come at a worse time for local owners who mostly sell food and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much needed relaxation –
The overall increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a delay in publishing new brands.

One study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media profile that hides him from his parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of \"false Instagrams\"
News has increased fear that sexual content is being published on such profiles
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main ” profile that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have created a social media profile that hides it from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of \"false Instagram – Profiles, a shortcut to the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has increased fear that sexual content is being published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear “main ” profile that they showed to their parents, while having other private profiles.
A mother who happened to find her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret profile met with a teenager who asked others to “rape him. ”
The study carried out by the “Digital Ageness UK ” and “The Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’’ Conference (HMC), in independent schools, showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles and half of them had admitted to being secret.
The head of “HMC – Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them. ”
Elid Doyle will be “the voice of athletes, ” the “Scottish Athletics Committee ”
Elid Doyle has been selected as the non-executive director of the Scotland Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and President Ian Bitti described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
\"All in Scotland, the British and world athletic communities have enormous respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board,\" Byty said.
Doyle said: “I am ready to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help direct the sport in Scotland,

Advertising breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows causes division of Internet opinions
The breast pump manufacturing company has caused a division of opinions on the Internet when it published an ad in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be “the world’s most active building pump, ” the user-oriented technology company Elvie, published a funny ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to breast-feeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a hay - filled cow stable of a song that sounds like this: “Yes, I milk milk, but you don’t see a tail, and “If you haven’t noticed these aren’t vimins, these are my breasts. ”
“ Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, milk, milk my breasts, milk
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it emphasizes “the horrors of the dairy industry.
\"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stolen from them after just a few days after they are born, ” says one comment.
Elvie's building pump is discreetly integrated into the breast-feeding bra (‘Elvie-/-Mother-)
Another comment is this: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who keep their babies -
Someone else added: “Real inappropriate advertising –
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really “smiley ”
\"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
The milking made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It is a brilliant product, ” one commentary said.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial for milk - milking mothers (often in their workplaces or in their toilets) and they feel like “bloods ”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry,
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while the discreet pumps were stuffed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fit into the breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom to move, to keep their babies, and even to get out of the house while milk is milking.
Anna Balarin, partner and RDR at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is indeed a revolutionary product and deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk milk and dairy cows, we wanted milk to be milked by pump and the challenges that bring them to the centre of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakubovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly, although border crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would need to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of minors without escorts.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of people arrested had no prior criminal record.
\"In fact, 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor family are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
So we continue to prosecute those individuals, ” said Mr. Albens.
In order to deal with children faster, authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them will be required to appear in court within a month after they are detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard was expressed.
Many of them will appear via a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their case of legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit to receive relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, workers say in shelters and reports that have appeared from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Thornillo, where signs of difficulties are more likely due to its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare for them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria told US, French and Turkish \"occupiation forces\" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem has called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory on the excuse that they are involved in the fight against terrorism and that \"they will be treated appropriately\"
\"They must withdraw immediately without conditions,\" he told the congregation.
Mualem insisted that “the war against terrorism is almost over, in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue \"to fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories - of the two terrorist groups and \"a section of an illegal foreign presence\"
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the country's territory destroyed by war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said that conditions are good for them to return and accuse them of \"some of the Western countries -- that they \"wipe irrational fears -- that move refugees to stay away.
\"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
\"They politicise the question that should be purely humanitarian,
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with assistance for reconstruction until political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards the Jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, which \"will be eradicated\",
UN envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to soon call the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to draw up a post-law for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem has established the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work on the panel should be limited to \"viewing the members of the current constitution,\" and warned of the consequences of further interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential mandate and scandal are terminated prematurely, likely to be a large part of the liberals' hope.
In what will no doubt be “the most dramatic final of the presidency that has ever been seen,
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, shock-time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN, and has increased almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nielsen says that “Fox News, on average there are 2.4 million light - time viewers, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and “The Rachel Maddow Show, ” at MSNBC, reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news was released.
\"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand, \" says Neil Baer, the main TV producer of the drama \"Designated Survivor, of the \"ABC\" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol has been destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skokal, a veteran in the writing of Comedy and the author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaping into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, ” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
\"He replied, \"Because I think he's really funny,\" Mrs. Skol told me.
And there's some fun value in all this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been watching a panel of experts debate the use of a “deep background ” source by Bob Woodward for his book“ Fear – a fur jacket from a Paul Manafort’s Noah of $15,000 (“ a thick-ass arrogant garment, ” as he called “The Washington Post“) and the implications of Mr. Trump’s shocking descriptions of the anatomy of Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
“ Part of what he does and how you feel about watching a reality show every night is that he brings you something new, ” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of “Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the “Pown Stars ” about the rotating team of Trump’s show and everyday twists (carans with the NFL, praises for Kim Yong-un).

Inflows of Foreign Resources in Top House's Narrowest Mid-term Elections
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania receives large amounts of funding thanks to the reorganization of congress areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is running by Democratics representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another area of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kit Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional area, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old areas were manipulated in favour of Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult competition for funding campaigns among the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congress Committee for Campaigns (‘DCCC’) and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party (‘NRCC’).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the extraordinary elections for the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district held in March that characterized themselves with broad media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area by a difference of 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats little advantage.
U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then quit.
The diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under low pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting in June 2017 with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of \"the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore,\" said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only with regard to El Salvador, fines were taken into account, which received US aid of about $1 140m in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and killing rates in it.
As internal meetings advanced, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior officials stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to any reflection on El Salvador's punishment.
Deputy President Mike Pens is due to address the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
Both the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of difficult messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing you know, is the release of Special Advisor Robert Miller's report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently very solid evidence in the public record.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the assembly changes, Mr. Trump will have to put responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and perhaps even before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There's a lot of uncertainty here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler if the West had opposed him and supported the Chehoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy has accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What if Mr. Trump resigned his deputy prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in the hot chair after the newspaper said he proposed last year to film the president in secret and speculate that he was unsuitable for the post he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
\"How will we act if Bret Cavanaugh's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite reliable allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that this will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorans of the \"Rangers\" - with optimistic attitude ahead of the \"Rapid Vienna\" conflict
\"The Rangers are hosting the conflict with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while aware of the fact that after the unsolved match against the \"Willarreal\" in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-class player because of knee damage, was prevented from showing up in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with Willarreal, but he believes that \"Ragers\" can use that result as a bounceboard towards greater achievements.
\"That was a good point for us because \"Willarreal\" is a good opponent,\" said 31-year-old player.
\"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
We may have been able to give a little more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
We have another big European night ahead of us on Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they have a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of fans, we'll fight back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given my injuries and changes to the club itself, but there is now some positive factor about the place.
The team's good and the guys really enjoy it; the training's good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success –
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although research participants had a clear idea of the way they want to be cared for, few have talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had discussed the long - term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
\"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss it,\" says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide,
Here's where you start.
Talk to your mate and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care if you don’t share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your adviser may also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your choices to finance long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or secure your own insurance with your own resources, if you have them.
Fix your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the beginning.
Take out full care so that you can enable a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also your financial resources.
In this way you would choose a person of trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you were not able to do it yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

In Indonesia, earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, aiders cannot obtain information from Dongala County, a region north of Palou that is closer to the 7.5 - degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Further, several key facts about Palou and Dongala, on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesti, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300km (180 miles) on the coastline in the northwest part of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated 299.200 population in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite Sulavesti coastline.
The Indonesia disaster relief agency says Palou and Dongala have been hit several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the west of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them being the inhabitants of Acech.
2005: A string of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the town of Padang, the Western Sumatra province's capital.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawa, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 metres and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake hit Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing havoc and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the earthquake caused no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Big earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president Sara Palin was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, a report released Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is located at the Matt-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays a $500 bill, \"KTUU\" said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was \"definitively innocent\" when asked him how to plead before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with class B violations, fined one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time I've filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaskan Veterans' Court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report on a domestic crime and possession of alcohol weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after saying her son's violent behavior stems from PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulavesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
The social media is circulating videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for the Palu Beach Festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors Ask for Rare Death Sentence for Suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Syfulo Saipov, suspected of a New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle route on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists on their way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally killed the eight victims and “intentionally ” committed serious physical injuries, consistent with the intention to seek the death penalty delivered to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is the possibility of a death sentence on both grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed charges against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack took “detail planning and imagination, ” the prosecutors said, with Saipov’s way of describing it as“ terrible, cruel, and perverse. ”
\"Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injuries, and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrice Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lare Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho, \"the reporting of the country's intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death sentence was prosecuted in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he asked to place an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent on all the 22 grounds of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed by the prosecution’s decision.
\"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than to accept a plea of guilt and to impose a life sentence without the possibility of a release will only extend the trauma of these events to everyone involved in them,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense earlier urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Party MP \"Tori\" says Nigel FARAJ should be in charge of Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the party's \"Tori\" conference, promised to \"mobilize the People's Army\"
The former party leader \"Ukip\" said politicians must \"feel the heat\" from Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's lawmakers proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn told the March of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be outside the EU by now \"if Mr. Faraz was Secretary for Bregzit.
But the challenge facing Ms. May's unification of her deeply divided members was highlighted by the party's counter-Bregzit party members, Tori, who joined a special protest against Bregzit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Hammers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregzit persons, counter-Brezit persons and the EU.
The allies insisted it would continue efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and \"haos\"
Mr. Bon said at the pro-Bregzit assembly \"Leave Mens Leave\" in Solihal that he wanted \"to reject the plan by the Hammers\"
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now,\" he said.
Velingborough's MP added: \"I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the plan from the Hammers\"
Voicing his stand against the EU, he said: \"We did not fight in world wars so that we could be subjected to it.

The Hammers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory in the elections.
Please give up the plan from the Hammers and start listening to us –

Gran Pri of Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to world title after team orders him to win Sebastian Vetel · Global Voices
From the moment Walter Botas qualified himself in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes' team's orders will play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in the lurch while defending his position in the first two laps and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered the boxing first and left Hamilton fighting the crowd's rumble, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who forced Ferrari's driver to leave the interior of his free risk of staying away after a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
He then led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raiconen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the other eight circles, so Raiconen came fourth.
It's a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have a couple in the race, ” said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein at the rally Saturday about her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are “wrong and dishonest and dishonest,
\"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what has happened in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and wicked and reckless and dishonest,\" he said.
\"When you look at posts and leaks of information and they say, \"Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me -
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it.
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn’t publish it, “he added, imitating the senator.
Fiinstein was sent a letter with information about the charges against Kavano by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Financialin denied that the leak came from her office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story,\" said Feynstein to the committee, announcing \"The Hill-
\"She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked.
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same event Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body talk.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen.
Continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
\"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their insolence, their don’t care who they hurt, who they need to step on to regain their power and control, ” said the president, “Mediaite,

A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on board rescue from the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping him fly hundreds of people safely to fly.
More than 800 people died, and many were missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong consecutive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
However, while his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of Muttiara Sis Al-Jufry in Palu, which was constantly swinging.
He remained in position to ensure that the aircraft at Batik Air, with the number of flight 6321 that was at the time on the runway, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was breaking down.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Syrait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision had probably saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian-Abs.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
\"This news broke our hearts,\" he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says accession to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutong is limited.
\"The number of victims is believed to be increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even access it,\" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that have reached six metres have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Quick help carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimarkets are all over the place -
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse –
In Indonesia President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready - CNN announcements -
At the beginning of this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aer Niugini: “Air Niugini ” now says that a man disappeared after the plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that operated with the plane that fell into the Lagoon in the Pacific in Mitrovica now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the plane they took.
In a statement, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon they could not find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the traveler, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
\"It's an extremely good job,\" Janes said.
Janes said that he and others were able to cross the water that reached half of them and head for emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were in panic and shouting, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue, with the help of an asphyxiation ship carrying people to the shore before the plane sinks to about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people were killed in PNG-recorded airlines in the last two decades, but none of them included the Air Niugini airline.
An analyst determined the time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded by presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of the man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Justice Department, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He stressed on the jury that he was using phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlet said he had received data on the location of several mobile phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, \"The Clarion Ledger --
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was \"lying because my truck was in Nashville\"
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
\"He erased her from his life,\" Hale said.
The defence should present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.

A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a “racist ” message
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being dismissed on the basis of discrimination after a mistake received a message from a mother who complained about the fact that she was “another black woman, ”
The married couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually a \"extremement\"
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris learned that she was black.
“ NOEEEEEEEE another black woman, ” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message addressed to her husband.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, feeling “uncomfortable, ” Mrs. Morris fired her, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, had badly done her job and that she had expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, announced “New York Post,
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the married couple and seeking compensation for the compensation of $350 a day in a six-month period, an engagement that will include living with the family, for which she was initially engaged, but without making a deal.
\"I want to show them that things like this should not be done,\" she told the Post on Friday, adding, \"I know it's discrimination,
The couple responded to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying that Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable action because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
\"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, ” said husband Joel Plascoe for “The Post ”
\"But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let’s Be Real
Saying that the lawsuit is “an extortion, ” Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
\"You will attack someone who is in such a situation?
That is not very nice, the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Padington fear that readers will not be able to connect to a talking bear is revealed in the new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond who was soon born after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of “Padington ”
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before receiving inspiration to write a book out of a little bear toy, would still be optimistic if his work had not been well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was \"and bitter and sweet\" after his death last year.
For “Padington, ” whom she describes as“ a very important member of our family, ” she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
\"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all,\" she said.
\"But because you felt \"Padington – so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you yourself.
I believe that Padington’s success had seen it that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited “Padington ” himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
On the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital “Louis Pasteur 2 ” in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
\"Hope called me regularly to say that the situation is very bad and that it is not expected to survive,\" Mrs. Enon-Laperuz said.
\"Then Nad called to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon enough.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly decreased, and they were coming out of her system.
She died before, and this meant that all of her systems were failing.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay put.
Eventually, Mrs. Enon-Laperuz mourned the loss of her daughter aboard the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
\"No one knew,\" she said.
\"I bent my head, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Sad women post cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are making efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are setting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
\"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,\" she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Ledney, says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as a contagious smile.
\"They all remembered him by his smile.
People always said that his smile could light any room -
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I constantly fear that this will have a consistent effect,
Mrs. Davis makes the cards “for others to know that there are people out there who can talk to and even if they are friends.
Do not sit in silence, you must start talking -
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark who she had been married 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
\"He did not say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing,\" she said.
\"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their presents, and he never looked them in the eye and made any contact with them –
She said that his death is an enormous trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “It is something that destroys the family.
We're left broken.
But we must keep on fighting

Brett Cavanaugh's future has been uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation.
\"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time investigation, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a little unity,\" Mr. Fleek said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee \"is falling apart\" under the conditions of the rooted partisan no-exit state.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his Republican Party supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitability is due only to timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, that is, on November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, again, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the pending results and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has been reduced - under Kim’s leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unity Ministry, reports that last year there were 1.127 border crossings compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The majority of North Korean refugees receive their citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, which can be more easily crossed compared to a well-protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China sees these people as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them in force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on a standstill for de-clearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US of stagnation in progress since now on Saturday.
\"Until there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first,\" Mr. Rie said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh “hysteric ” and says that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano \"hysteric\" and said that given his temper, he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the festival \"Texas Tribune Festival – in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was \"hysteric,\" Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassi Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes even shouting and crying as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also made clear the democratic condemnation in the committee, calling the allegations against him \"grossy and co-ordinated destruction of his reputation – organised by liberals who are outraged that Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Cavano's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he proved partial to the Democrats.
\"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavano from office if the allegations against him are confirmed and if the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even fit to serve in a court where he is in office at the moment,\" Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible verdicts that Kavano will make against the Law on Accession Health Care or Roe against Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Cavanaugh did not answer the questions about whether to nullify some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
\"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, \"it is really wonderful, isn't it,\" Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger that she can't free herself without crying.
\"We cry when we are angry,\" Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think that's unusual, do I?\"
She continued, “a woman who was performing an executive function helped me a lot, and who told me that she also cries when she is angry but managed to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she is talking to, “Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius.
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misread.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated is when I once started crying with unremarkable anger and an older woman, a cold manager of which I had always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
\"Never let them see you cry,\" he said.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will enjoy the fact that they have reached out to you –
Patricia Shredder was a Democratic congressman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called \"Monkey Business\" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schrader, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
\"It was not a well thought-out decision,\" he told me 30 years later through laughter.
\"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. ”
Given the fact that the campaign was long started, it did not have enough funding, so promised it would not enter the race if it did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 each would only give her $250.
\"Do they think there should be a discount for me?\" she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overwhelmed by the emotions, or gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration from the system that made it so hard to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
\"If you had seen me, you probably would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown, \"remembers how the media reacted to the incident.
\"You'd think \"Klinex\" was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my headstone.
She's crying.
How trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire at the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was stifling, and although the battle is far from over, conflict between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation significantly escalated this week by introducing new 200 billion-dollar tariffs for goods (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods coming from the United States of China.
Beijing was returning to nature each time, i.e. recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return the United States to the same measure, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up recently.
To force Washington to step down means to accept his demands, but public worship in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long run because it will reduce the interdependentness of the two economies.
\"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than what was previously established by observers,\" said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a tank.
Syria \"prepared\" for refugee returns, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
\"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to progress made in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the country's voluntary return to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that have been reflected in their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe Wins a Significant Rider Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team in the Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in the European field and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the primate after Danish captain Thomas Björn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mikkelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, placed the ball in the water in the steam-3 of 16th hole when he lost to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been noted in all circles, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0 after the current format tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest-ranked European team player, Torbjorn Oleshen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 from Ian Paulter of England, who may have last played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant of eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the top titles of the 25.5-point tournament during his career.
\"I don't normally cry, but I can't stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to help, ” said the emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He now gives way to his compatriot John Ram, who beat one on Sunday Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, score two to one.
\"I feel incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play,\" said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is about the amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking for Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to point the game towards low- grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik said after his team's disappointing game, \"I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we've been giving the team a hard time in Europe.
We fought.
It's a drop for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
We've been outplayed.
