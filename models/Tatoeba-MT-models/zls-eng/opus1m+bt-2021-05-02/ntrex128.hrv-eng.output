The Welsh MPs are worried that they'll \"look like Muppe-
Some MPs of Parliament, AM, amazed to call them MPs of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
It was due to plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The MPs from all political spectrum are concerned that they might become subject to a mockery.
A Labour Party MP said his group is concerned that the term \"rhyming with Twp and Pwp\"
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means dumbass, a pwp shit.
The MP from the Party of Wales (Plaid Cymru) said that the group \"is not satisfied\" as a whole – and proposed alternative solutions.
Velski Conservative said his group was \"open\" for changing the name, but that MWP could quickly turn into a Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word “w ” is similar to that expressed in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a change of name, said: \"Of course the final decision on how parliamentary MPs will title themselves,
The 2017 government law of Wales gave the Welsh Parliament the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that have come across broad support for changing the name of parliament in the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what MPs will be called in the Assembly, the Committee was inclined to name \"the members of the Welsh Parliament – or the MWPs\", but the MWP was given the greatest support during public consultation.
The MPs are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus could bring the president of the Elin Jones Parliament, which is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way Parliament works, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, the MPs will have a decisive vote on what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on country name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to \"The Republic of Northern Macedonia\"
Voting aims to resolve decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a property of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite, said he would not recognise a referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, insist that the change is a simple price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
They silence St. Martin's bells while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
\"The older people I spoke to said that a bar and a church could be found at every corner in the past, \" Mr. Adams said.
\"Today there's neither one nor the other\"
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
\"People are friends today in another way,\" he said.
“The bars no longer represent the living room of the neighborhood in which people regularly stay,
When it comes to churches, however, he is concerned that money from selling property will not last as long as church leaders think and “almost or later will be found again at the beginning,
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with dwellings where people who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood would live.
\"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be whites – he said, \"The day will therefore come faster when these churches will be fully closed because it is unlikely that residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches,
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the church of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that kept the services nearby has taken ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church has taken over the black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the head of a retailer's boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed to hiring or improving blacks.
The 1939 fire was heavily damaged by the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and heir in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the rings of the poor people, ”
In July, an expert who played carillon in July used the second term: “cultural treasure – and“ unrealable historical instrument –
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by Black Musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has played at the larger carillon in Riverside for 18 years.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors of construction works, some of which brought along layian church leaders and other episcopal decadences.
The sacristy, the winged body of the parish composed of laic, wrote a decadesis in July about the concern that the decadeza would try to transfer the costs to the sacristy, even though the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of the construction works sent by the decess.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the children’s side.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official announcement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then drove the group to the attack site to help with his extraction from the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was a thrill about the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling \"He bit me!
He bit me.
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicle was torn apart.
“I pretended to get everyone out of the water: “There is a shark in the water! ” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
The authorities closed at 48 h the beach access from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct the investigation and safety of the bathers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Saintsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of store houses and by hiring specialized sellers.
As part of the large entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 billion. GBP, which continues to grow compared to the decline in sales on the home clothing and equipment market, the larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expand to additional shops next year if shown to the successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use the space on shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
The representatives of Sainsbury’s said they would double the size of cosmetic products' offers on 3000 products, including the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, maybelline and Burt’s Bees will receive more space from areas for certain brands similar to stores such as Boots.
Supermarket is also reinvigorating its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are looking for more and more.
In addition, the merchant of the Fragrance Shop perfumes will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first opened in Croydon last week in southern London and the second opening in Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and return to daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets need to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will look more and more like a department store while this supermarket chain seeks to resist favourable shops such as Aldi and Lidl offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlet Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitas departments because he bought both chains two years ago, thus claiming to encourage the sale of live supplies and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
In the beginning of 2000, Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Boots, but it ended with an argument over the division of revenues from drugstores in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold its pharmaceutical job in 281 Celesiu, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims that Lloyds will play a part in the plan by placing a combination of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks commercial director Sainsbury stated: “We changed the appearance and impression of our departments with cosmetic products to give our users a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and the available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changing old purchasing habits –
Peter Jones - angered - after Holly Willoughby gave up the contract worth 11 million pounds
Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones show star left that “cook of anger ” after TV director Holly Willoughby gave up the 11 million-pound contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer chain and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of house clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand is compared to Goop Gwynet Paltrow.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones star to cook with rage by withdrawing from the joint profitable business to focus on her new awesome contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was “excited – when a golden girl is television during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, she admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million mean that there is no more time to devote to their brand of clothing and fashion accessories Truly.
This business is compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and should have doubled Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said, \"Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have provided it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw freaked out everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening Tuesday so close to starting the entire line.
There's a lot of goods at the Marlow warehouse headquarters that are ready for sale.
Experts believe that because of the departure of the head of this Morning show, one of the stars in Britain that was most paid off, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and possible additional delays in starting the line.
And that could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Wiloughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capp, and Jones (52) joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend their holidays together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as Head of ITV's I”m Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said, \"We don't want to comment on his business activities –
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticisms he will receive in the newspapers over comments some might consider “indecent president ” and because he has such a positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
\"Why did President Trump give so many concessions,
He said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
\"I didn't make any concessions.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denucleating North Korea.
But the denucleation negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice a “proper reaction – the United States of America to the disarmament activities of North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States has not yet lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stand in his talk at the convention.
\"We're doing great with North Korea,\" he said.
\"We were threatened by war with North Korea.
Millions of people would get hurt.
Now we have a great relationship -
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – to stop test rocket launches, to help free hostages and bring the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It is so easy to act like the president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people to enter front of this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there, Trump said, pointing to a crowd directly ahead.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, following the earthquake at Lombok by foreign NGOs, they were said not to be necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboca has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about the fact that they were not seeking international aid, so it is all a bit of a problem,\" said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the organisation of Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Suto, spokeswoman of the Office for National Disasters, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paluo to see if international agencies are allowed to engage in aid efforts.
In view of the constant shake of soil in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although the shelters in the case of tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coastal line.
The lack of a siren for tsunami warning in Palu, although the warning was in effect, has probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at best time travel between a number of Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship that was anchored in Lombok to provide earthquake victims on the way is in Pal, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The improvement of the Indonesian decommissioned structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money has been invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are taking place next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets of swords, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge scored a score to equate against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Saturday's Liverpool from defeating the Prime Minister League against Chelsea in the 89th minute at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was approximately 30 metres from the goal Chelsea at a 1:0 score for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before kicking her against the counter.
The ball flew high above the goal point towards the right upper corner of the net.
In the end, the ball escaped Kepaj Arrizabalagaya, who jumped towards her and entered the net.
\"It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible – said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com
\"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot-
Chelsea led halftime with 1:0 after a hit by a Belgian star named Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
Blue Attacker passed the ball back to Mate Kovacic during that game before turning somewhere in half a field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić performed a quick pass in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed the beautiful passing ball that led Hazarda to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot in the net on the opposite post next to Liverpool's Liverpool goalie, Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3:00 on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster office said Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that it has been reported that a large number of people are trapped in the ruins of buildings after an earthquake of 7.5 that was felt on Friday and caused waves of heights up to 6 metres.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man 32 on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed dead.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body was found in Birkenhead in Mercyside this morning.
A 44-year-old girl was found at 0755 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
The police invited people from the area to report if they had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation –
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead's population was found and found in the building.
This afternoon on stage came friends who think they know this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said the process of notifying the nearest relatives of the victim is ongoing.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He lost his word when he found out what happened.
The residents were now told it would take several hours until they could return to their apartments.
Apparently, an officer told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying: “It’s so terrible.
At 2:00 in the fenced area, there were two police vans, and another one was parked right outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the residential block.
Of all those who have any information, it is requested that they send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101, or anonymously address the Crimestoppers organisation at 0800 555 111, calling for the minutes 247 of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of the debate on \"the end of history –
His persecution would be the poetic justice for almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt to be stupid - and - I'm trying to break history -
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate currently under way regarding the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful resurrection of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is proof of 19th century thinking and part of the history of the person many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell many believe, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender than external pressure.
Is that a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historic debate that continues.
What is certain is that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual distinctive figure representing one side of that division.
His accomplishments in the role of the Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honour and mark.
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed farmers in the southwestern market of China.
A man named only “Yuan – a dead severed artery was found and covered in blood at a market stop in the Liupanshui province of Guizhou published on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to vaccinated pigs in a pig on 30 May 2005 in Xing in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
Apparently, he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighs 250 kilos to death by the breeder.
Evening news from Guiyang suggests that a cousin named Wu, said: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and maimed,
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
Market manager told Evenings news that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack by another police gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are allegedly negotiating a fee for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked his wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig slipped a Welsh farmer along a tractor until his wife drove an animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “strike”
\"They are just played.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to be shown respect, he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As it is most improbable, the Rosa hurricane weakens over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring flood rains to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 05:00 p.m., Rosa blew at 140 km/h, making it a 1st category hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the area of low pressure is being created and is moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, a deep layer of tropical moisture will begin to suppress in the direction of the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy rainfall to occur on a large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous wind floods, mud wells and possible slides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will result in rainfall that will amount to approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 25 to 100 mm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be a brisk flood with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
There is no advice on going to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild river, and thunder showers will bring local stormy winds and dusty blinds.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rain on parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to drop more than 12 mm, which may result in less muddy slopes and a slippery road.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical showers will start approaching Arizona on Sunday late evening and early Monday morning before covering the wider area at the end of the day Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will be touched on Tuesday and will last all day Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the delayed summer heat will continue to rise and expand again.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm with 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast in most Central and Eastern United States.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday six television networks a tense testimony of the candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political statement continued, and reporters interrupted a regular programme to inform about the turnover last-minute this Friday: a deal reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would carry out a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Board that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning testimony that he is absolutely sure that it did not happen.
Friday's hearing was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties measuring the number of people who look at the content in the offices.
In order to get a better look at it, it's about a audience that's a lot like the one watching American football or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning they recorded protesters shouting at him as he attempted to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
For a few minutes, he stood down and looked down while live in front of CNN's cameras, the protestors gave him grief.
\"I am standing here in front of you, said one woman.
\"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
They said: “You have power while so many women are helpless.
Flake said his office published a statement and before the elevator door closed, he would say more at the board hearing.
Several hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Committee was to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigates allegations against the candidate over the next week, requiring the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the FBI's case against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her exit plan from the European Union of \"playing politics – with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the United Kingdom Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview in the same issue with her on the front page, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs duties - complete nonsense -
The murder of Wade Sims: police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspected of the death of LSU players
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of non-stop murder, Baton Rouge police administration said.
Officials posted a video of a conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reported WAFB, a CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
A $350,000 bail has been requested.
The east Baton Rouge municipality coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot head wound through the neck.
The police department thanks the task force for the fugitives of the federal state police Louisiana, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the police of Southern University and citizens of the area for helping in an investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for the implementation of the law on \"sustainableity and the search for truth\"
Sims was 20 years old.
A player on a 6-inch wing grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach in LSU, Will Wade, said the team was desperate for Wade's death.
\"That's what we always worry about,\" Wade said.
Volcano casts ash on Mexico City
The ashes that cast out the Popocatapetl volcano reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans Saturday not to approach the volcano after increased crater activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple rumblings and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash in car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased volcanic activity that is 72km southeast of the capital since the 2017 earthquake of the 7.1 Magnitude has shaken Central Mexico.
The Vulcan known as \"Don Goyo\" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalonia Separatists conflict with the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors who advocate independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands joined the anti-distributions to mark the catalon polarizing vote of secession.
A group of masked separatists who had become involved in intervention police began to shoot cops with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
Fights broke out even later during the day when police used sticks to calm the fight.
Over the course of several hours, the groups who advocate independence were chanting, “No forgetfulness, no forgiveness, and contrary to them, the unioners were shouting, “Long lived Spain,
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
The tensions in the region seeking independence did not shrink even a year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, which the Catalons separatists of glory.
The vast majority of voters chose independence even though turnout was small because those against secession mainly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalonia authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
The independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended Separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
\"Last years we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of luck for being able to vote, but now we are stuck, he said.
Despite having achieved a key victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalonia Party has managed hard to hold momentum this year because its most famous leaders are in self-inflicted exile or in detention awaiting trial due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone to support the police, said the conflict prompted politicians both sides.
\"The situation is getting tense – he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders, who has been in jail since the end of last year, announced that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
\"Candidating for European elections is the best way to announce the repression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government – he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after driving a car into the house
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after being hit in Londonderry's house by car more than once.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said that the courtyard door and the building themselves were damaged.
It's possible a crossbow arrow was fired on the car at some point.
Bingo Menge brought Livingston's victory over the Rangers with score 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston brought victory
The new club of the Scottish Premium League Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat since 18 games at the head of the club from the Ibrox stadium.
The Dolly Menge shot proved decisive while Gary Holt's team settled down with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team remains without victory in the Prime Ministership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading league club behind which eight points are left behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Club as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his win to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still hasn't experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against deadly guests.
Holt's team was also supposed to lead the team before they reached the hit, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on his way to the goal, and after that, Alan Lithgow could only take a wide hand of the ball after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head against the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for the guests.
And that's exactly how the key goal was won.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston designed the opening, whereby Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisted Menga together to assist in the middle of the goal.
By that point, the Rangers were mostly in control of the ball, but they faced an impenetrable domestic defense, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
That continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Rangers Rangers' legs, Allan McGregor, came out of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow had a broad blow from another organised attack by Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross the goal line of Livingstone, and no two 11-year-olds were awarded – after Halkett's conflict with substitute player Glen Middleton and one for hand-playing.
‘Great – from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdar Lamont of the Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and score of Livingston.
Each and every one of them was excellent, thus continuing to exceed expectations on that entry path.
Their style of game and staff have hardly changed since their return to the great clubs, but great merit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of an excellent organized defense, and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worral take a break throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were a long way from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They didn't make it to the end. They only opened a hole in the home team once, and it's kind of an invitation to trade for Rangers in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th), it was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany -- aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of president's supporters came to see him nearby.
And hundreds of protestors of Erdogan -- of which a large number of Kurds -- have raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The conflicted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as an autocrat.
A crash in Deptford: a cyclist fatally killed in a car collision
A cyclist died in a car collision in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeastern city around 10:15 BST.

The crash took place several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the escape of a driver from the scene from Chiders Street, approximately a mile from Saturday's scene.
City police said police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his closest relatives.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus transport was rerouted and motor vehicles were recommended to avoid this area.
Prison in Long Lartin: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in a riot in a man-at-arms prison.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special ‘Tornado’ units have been brought in to combat riots involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene have been provided with assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: \"Such trained prison staff were hired to solve an ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff received help with their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clearly want to make it clear that all those responsible will be given to the police and that they could spend longer time behind bars –
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, he announced that the prison manager had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called to prison to solve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with brisk floods (a possible benefit for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hits Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen at the beginning of next week when the rosa hurricane moves with the remaining force across the desert southwest and brings the risk of brisk floods.
The national hydrometeorological service has already issued warnings about the up-to-date floods for Monday and Tuesday in the West Arizona area, via South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with rain and cross it straight over on Tuesday.
In its tweet, the National Hydrometerology Service in Phoenix stated that, since 1950, only ten tropical cylons have brought tropical storms or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border –
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre foresees 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogolonian edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest including Stenjak and the Great Pool, there is a probability of a rainfall of 25 to 50 mm, with a possible isolated total of up to 100 mm.
For those beyond the danger of the brisk floods of Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a major danger, some of these rainfalls could be useful because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
“A little more than 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by extreme drought, the second highest category – published byweather.com
The hurricane's journey first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm has hit colder Pacific waters and has therefore weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or the evening will approach the coast of Mexico with the power of the tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and poses a significant danger of floods.
“The amount of total rainfall expected in the area from the Bay California peninsula to the northwest Sonore ranges from 75 to 150 mm, possibly 250 mm – published byweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then cross Arizona and South Utah by Tuesday evening.
\"The main danger expected of Rose or her remains is very heavy rain on the Bay California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the US Desert Southwest – the National Hurricane Centre said.
It is expected that these rains will cause life-threatening floods and mud torrents in the deserts, and slides on the mountain field.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset with stab wounds.
About 04:00 BST was found a injured teenager in Excelsior Terrace on Saturday in Midsomer Norton.
He's been taken to a hospital and in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police Department said that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called in everyone who has footage of the event.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the malice and anger of the Democratic Party
\"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to dismiss the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh \"suffered the malice and anger of the Democratic side during the nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday and emotionally and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford's charges of sexual assault tens of years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified in a hearing about the charges she made.
On Saturday, the president said that “the American people saw the brightness, quality, and courage on that day, Kavanaugh.
\"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service, \"he said to the crowds in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he discussed the importance of the Republicans' election in half of the presidential term.
\"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am, he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates -
Trump argued that the Democratic mission was to \"make resistance and obstructions\"
The Republican leadership's assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed dead, many of them were dragged away by massive waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pal on Friday, when at dusk waves of up to six metres high hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and tearing everything down on their way.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
\"When the danger of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, and they died,” said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency for mitigation of the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
\"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land,\" said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
\"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palou.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and destroyed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake corresponded to two hundredfold the strength of the atomic bomb thrown at Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as \"extensive\" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres, and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damage may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palua, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
\"Communications are completely broken and we don't have information from Donggal.
\"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area – it is in a statement of the Red Cross that adds and that staff and volunteers have gone to affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get very bad – the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism over the lack of information that the tsunami hit Pal, although officials claim the waves arrived at the moment the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of a building panics people down on the street about an upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the power outage that caused the blackout of communications on Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the competent military, it began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport is once again only open to humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palou on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has taken more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
\"Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived successfully in the town of Pal in which the employees were placed in tarpaulin tents in the backyard of their office, they passed on scenes of destruction on the road, \"Mr. Doseb said.
\"They told me they saw numerous destroyed houses,\" he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched relief wheels in disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have made it impossible for them to arrive in the Palace.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"It is still a disaster at the province level,\" said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says “OK, this is a national disaster” we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared “
When the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the ruins next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragladers for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagia, were his disciples.
\"In view of the many years spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden – he said.
Gendon remembered that after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paraglider community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the competitions from Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray clutch instead of two blue clutches.
\"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered – he said.
Thieves took $2,750 while filling ATMs in downtown Newport on the Left
Thieves stole $26,750 from Brinck's employees Friday morning who filled the ATM in the Newport on the Leave, according to a statement from the Newport Police Administration Press.
In a statement from Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver had emptied the ATM machine in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, another man came to the race with a background on Brinck’s employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses have noticed several suspected persons fleeing the scene, but police have not listed the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
On Saturday, on Twitter, the change he announced, he wrote: “The living will be officially known as Kanye West –
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes ahead of his holiday on Saturday Night Live, which is expected to launch his new album, Jandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced the singer Arian Grande on the show, who canceled because of \"emotional reasons\"
In addition to the shortness of his current artistic name, West had earlier stated that the word had religious meaning for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible that means “you”, West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means “the only one – in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are –
He's the one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And one of West's former associates, Jay-Z, played with versions of his name without a cartoon and a cartoon and written big letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use an army against citizens
Mexican President's candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that \"they will never use an army against the Mexican people –
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people at the time the leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those who study and open up a number of free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attract young criminals.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount that it invests in research in the area,” said the investor in artificial intelligence and an expert on that area, Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks a formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
\"A double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start since all other countries are far behind the United States and are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence – Lee said.
\"Double investment increase could double the chances that by the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will come to the US – Lee said this week in a CNBC interview.
Lee, whose book: “AI is a great book: China, the Silicon Valley and a new world order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the '80s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that beat the best American player of the Othello game, and later he was director in Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked the question when to hold the following to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
\"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations,\" Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from universities to work on the research of artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
\"I believe that the Ph.D.s in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards – he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Art Intelligence Development Plan next generation in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions similar to what the National Foundation for Science and Other State Organisations provides financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China – Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners from the activities and academic communities, and the White House announced the establishment of the IQ Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
In terms of NSF, he currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Saturday on whether they want to change their country's name to \"The Republic of Northern Macedonia\" -- a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece for several decades and thus block Greece from opening accession talks with the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claiming that its northern neighbour's name is a sweep of its territory and vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The issue on the referendum ballot said: \"Do you wish to join NATO and the EU, while accepting an agreement with Greece,
Addressers to the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for in order to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the break-up of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
\"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means safer lives for all of us – said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national electoral commission said no irregularities were reported until 13 hours.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
\"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe – said 62-year-old Gjos Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 on the country's name change, opening the way for NATO's association with the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, in front of parliament in Skopje, set a small stage and received chairs outside the tents set by those boycotting the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join elevated heads, not as servants,\" Kavadarkov said.
\"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they won't accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration –
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much investment needed to Macedonia, a country in which the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
\"I believe the vast majority will support the referendum, since more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO -- Zaev said after the vote.
He said that \"positive\" would result in \"confirming our future\"
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30% and 43% of voters will join the referendum, below the necessary response.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said it would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would have been the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: a Manchester City player Sergio Aguero walks through the entire Brighton defense to score a hit
Sergio Aguero and Racheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defenses and took the 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday.
Aguero made the victory a foolishly simple, reaching a hit at 65 minutes.
The Argentinan attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three players of Brighton's defense and then reached open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four rival players in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender, then overcame several others on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera, who threw the right-hand digging ball into the right side of the network and defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
\"Aguero has some trouble with his foot – journalists reported to the manager of Manchester City, Pep Guarddillo.
\"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky to have a hit at that moment.
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Prime Minister League.
That shot was won at 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep on Brighton's field during that game.
He added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before placing Sterling on the stand.
Sky Blues' attacker threw the ball into the net just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City fights the Hoffenheim Group League champions on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Germany's Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the progress of Rockys
Since Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who take advantage of a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get into play.
The Rockies on Friday night won 5 : 2 over the Nationals at least secured a place in the wild-card playoffs, but they still hope to win their first title.
\"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw out knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with lots of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would testify to this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
Nationals still have to publish Sunday's starter, but allegedly in that case they are inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-wing Washington during this season achieved a result of 18:7 average running (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During the talks on the importance of Republican voters' turnout in the general elections, the president commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge.
\"Everything we have done will be tested in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the big, big -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere, in order to fight for great candidates, he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to regain power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take control and control; so they want power and control.
The Democrats, he says, have a mission \"to resist and interfere –
\"You have seen it during the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"the angry, the evil, the corrupt and the liars.\"
He appointed Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee, which sparked a loud disapproval of the audience.
\"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document -- it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen --
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
It does not tolerate the making of personal views
It didn't surprise me too much when the momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour party representatives who are said not to be welcome – and all because of what we said about what was on our minds.
According to me, a representative associate named Joan Ryan acted similarly because she firmly opposed anti-semitism.
I was criticized by the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironicly similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
On Friday's notice of the Labour Party's meeting, Nottingham's East said that \"we want meetings to be inclusive and productive,
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local Labour Party representative the meetings of the General Council Friday evening were exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings are taking place today in a different tone, and the promise of “kinder, gentler, ” politics is long forgotten if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion was assessed on the basis of whether they were acceptable to party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since my associates, who I thought shared similar political opinions, began to demand a drastic change of mind and a stand that I would otherwise never agree with - whether it was a national security or a single EU market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there is a series of offensive words on social networks that call my recall, which deny centre policies and tell me I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I've been given are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of colleagues who face the avalanche of sexist or racist comments daily, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me most is tolerating abusive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each proposal of mistrust or amendment of the electoral rules, we become an increasingly narrower party.
Many times in the last two years, they've advised me to bow my head, not to be so loud and told me that then everything would be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by neglecting the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school's multi-purpose classroom failing, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local councilman or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, not in my last election.
No one at Nottingham East could have been misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would recommend to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment the country grabs to Brexit, which will adversely affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire that time and energy be lost on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituency, whether it be for the members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political gain will prevent me from acting in the way I feel that it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heading to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premium League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and are the only ones left undefeated by ten teams.
Finally, the ultimate defense and better exploitation of opportunity led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
\"So far we have been tested at every game and still undefeated, so I must be happy – he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: “Each honor to Ayra, they have taken advantage of opportunities better than we have.
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, which was realized by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr in the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to raise the score, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership with a 1ster before, at the very half-time, reached a hit and realised an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 p.m.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
And then there was a long break due to the serious Ruardha Knott injury they took on the stretchers, and when the game went on, Ayr continued to play a good game with the attempt by Stafford McDowell who realized to Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then received yellow card and Melrose again forced an extra player to pay, and this unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Stroan Hutchinson got yellow card to bring down the Climate that didn't have the ball; from the line for a criminal impact, MacPherson performed laying behind Ayra in full swing of the breakthrough.
Climo realized, how he'd done it since the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took the high blow from David Armstrong and sent Gregory Henry's side player in the fifth attempt by the domestic team.
The Still Game series star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two men announced that the coming ninth season will be the last to be displayed, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to include himself in “a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow ”
\"The sea is ours –: Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will assign its exit to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a maritime center full of cranes in La Paz.
The ocean color flag has been reported in public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are orient: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to give him back.
In all of Bolivia, which has no sea exit, the memory of the lost sea coast in the favour of Chile during the conflict due to resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as is the longing for the re-altering of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting a verdict of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1st, after a five-year procedure, hopes may be at the highest level in decades.
\"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistically awaiting the outcome, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians across the country will see the International Court of Justice's verdict on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the withdrawal of the sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here, Morales, the Bolivian charismatic autochtonic president who faces a controversial battle to re-elected next year, can also benefit from Monday's verdict.
\"We are near the return of the Pacific – he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favour of Bolivia and that little would change if that were the case.
A UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearing means that the case “was not complex,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
Instead of promoting the interests of Bolivia, the last four years may have recovered them.
\"The question of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership, \" said Zárate.
Morales's retortical war has buried any goodwill in Chile, according to him.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at some point, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made an unusual decision quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia “an opportunity to start a new period of relations with Chile ” and an opportunity to“ end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
\"Bolivia will never give up the right to access to the Pacific – he added.
\"It is a judgment of opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past,
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never nuclearly disarm themselves if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep promises of days during the meeting of the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
Commentare was given the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Una.
Ri says sanctions have continued due to \"refused fantasies\" and that the US's opposition to the end of the Korean War will by no means throw the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want to meet second at the summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to renounce the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows that the last line of large covers for the head on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely shelter the sun, do not look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the fashion track a line of unspoiled giant head coverings for their spring and summer collection 2019 and impressed style lovers at Paris Week of Fashion.
Exceptionally impractical hats this summer have swept Instagram, and these designers have sent their own creations that attract attention to the runway.
The outstanding example was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that he has “taken over the head of the model. ”
Other cumbersome supplements included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these supplements were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a dissipation and a mask, and the other one looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
Follow the big fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
The styleists predict that huge hats may come to luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly along the heels of La Bombe, a straw hat of approximately 60 cm wide, seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered the social networks on the runway sent another great creation – a strawd beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
The orange ruffian bag, decorated with lines from the raffia and the white leather handle, was an exhibition copy in the summer collection Jacques' La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Week of Fashion.
A styler of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told F{: “I expect large hats and beach bags in luxury stores for the next summer. Since the designer has left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories –
John Edward: The language skills that the citizens of the world need
The Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary results of the exams, and the additional weight is given by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) try to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the specified school course, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela stated: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes into his heart -
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages achieved independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 schools of SCIS shows that 72% of students received an excellent rating for Mandarin language, while 72% of students studying German received the highest possible rating, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key skill children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as election subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers could not fill jobs due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for careers.
Since language knowledge is increasingly sought in more and more places of work, skills are key in the globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the advantages of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can directly communicate with foreigners, and this gives her the advantage of competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 by more than 4000 adults, 75% of subjects in the United Kingdom did not know the foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and the French is the only language that speaks the two-digit percentage of the subjects, specifically 15% of them.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, each school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will decide on languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professional in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools provide children with an environment where learning will prepare and arm the skills needed for success, regardless of the future.
The fact cannot be ignored that today’s global business is very important for the future of each country so that it also has to reflect on education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be regarded as “International Communications Skills,
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools
LeBron will be playing Lakers for the first time Sunday in San Diego.
The fans will soon welcome the first performance by LeBron James for the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
\"More than one and less than 48 minutes – Walton told the Official Page of Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudrell announced a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in the Lakers, which consists of six games.
\"In this phase of my career, I really don't need pre-season games,\" he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign with a number of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned gatherings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted in favour of a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does tonight's Trump rally in West Virginia begin, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia was scheduled for 19 hours east of time, tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump meeting in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh's candidates who have caused controversy on charges of sexual abuse.
However, the primary objective of this set of meetings is to help the Republicans take the lead in November's elections.
As a result, Trump's presidential campaign headquarters report that five meetings scheduled for the next week are aimed to “stimulate volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
\"The majority of Congress is so important for the president's plans that they will travel to as many countries as we can as we enter a stormy campaign -- he told Reuters an anonymous spokesperson for Trump's campaign.
Tonight's event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month on Saturday. In this country in 2016 he won more than 40 per cent.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is behind in the polls.
\"It is not a good sign for Morrisey to have the president help him improve the ranking in the polls,\" said politician Simon Haedar of West Virginia University for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018.: The US team left her heart on the ground before Sunday's individual riots
After three one-sided sessions of couples Sunday afternoon maybe what was supposed to be turned by Ryder Cup.
\"The wheel of happiness turns around – the saying is especially valid in sports and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the wheel of happiness now welcome?
\"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is on our side at the moment – Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are ahead by four points, while there are 12 points left to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encourage his double game with Justin Thomas, with which he won three out of four points after a day's game.
Spieth played murderously from Tee to Green and could serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading cheers were getting louder when Spieth and Thomas came up with two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path with which Spieth came to an unsolved result.
Following the 15-hole win-off road, a similar cheerleading roar was followed in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can turn everything around.
\"All you need to do is concentrate and think about your game,\" Spieth said.
That's all that's left for those players right now.
18 holes and can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
A European weird but adorable couple has a maximum score and can't be wrong.
\"Molliwood is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back Nina on Friday morning.
This winning sequence, as well as the incredible energy connecting Fleetwood and Molinari, shows that they are the players to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’s Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too soon to talk about the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Norren and Sergija Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One Bogey and two double Bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swedish man in a hole they couldn't dig out of.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one who will help individuals dig out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch a game of couples close by because you can see the interactions of players in pairs, hear the advice given and those that don't give, and study a strategy that can change at the moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary combat, in which some, especially the Statesides, suspected.
Europeans on the last day of Ryder Cup enter with leadership from 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day, Ryder Cupa enters with a significant advantage over the United States of America at 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn in an effort to win the trophy that lost her in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs with a result of 3 to 1.
The American team showed greater combat in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win Jim Furyk's trophy, eight points are to be collected in the 12 individual games held Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as \"Molliwood – after a sensational weekend, only the second couple who won four points in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs, they proved superior to Woods and US debutant Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games performed some genius moves, but now he has 19 games in fours and a couple and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs so that he and his partner, Henry Stanson, would return to the game with couples and have a 2 & 1 loss from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But not everything went as lubricated during the pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The triple winner of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting the ranking high on their American team.
First they defeated Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2&1 in fourballs, and then they defeated Paul and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice in the history of Ryder Cup team, which was left behind four points, managed to return to individual games, although the Furykov team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, the weekly counterattack seems to be hard for them.
North Korea announces that \"no chance - for unilateral disarmament without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that last year North Korea took “significant good faith measures, for example, halted nuclear and missile tests, dismantled nuclear power stations for testing, and decided to stop nuclear technology and weapons.
\"But we have not received a satisfactory reaction from the United States – he added.
\"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we don't have faith in our national security either.
Although Ri reiterated the famous complaints made by North Korea on Washington’s resistance - a gradual approach to denucleisation under which the sanctions would gradually be lifted to North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denucleisation of how Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim made a promise to work on “denuclarising the Korean Peninsula ” while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
\"The US insists that denuclearisation be carried out before that and pressured through sanctions to force itself to achieve its goal, and even counter-proclaiming the end of the war,\" Ri added.
\"Perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust.
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for the second Kim and Trump meeting the President of the United States spoke about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had even held three meetings in the last five months and added: \"If denuclearisation had been sought by South Korea and not by the United States, denucleisation of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a halt,
Nevertheless, the tone of Minister Rio's speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly and said that the target of the continental United States was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a \"human rocket\" on a suicidal mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened to \"fully destroy - North Korea this year praised Kim in the United Nations for his bravery for disarmament, but added that there are many more jobs ahead of them and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea executes denucleization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denucleating and added: \"It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months,
China and Russia have expressed their view that the UN Security Council should be rewarded by Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue strictly until complete, final and verifiable denucleisation takes place,
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an effort to stop the financing of the nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
He met with Ray at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeaux has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but after several hours, North Korea called him because of \"gangster demands\"
North Korea has set up a meeting with Moon this month to demonstrate the missile location and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes \"proper measures\"
He added that Kim revealed to him that these \"proper measures are related to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course learning how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to sleep well in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's finest university often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he considers to be the first of these types in the United States.
The idea of the course came after he gave a talk about the effect of the sleep depriving on learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: “Why did I find this out only now, at the last year of college,
She said that no one had told her how important the dream was, which surprised me, “he told The Telegraph.
The course held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and Executive Director of Health Service Paul Barreira says the University has decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
One hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes an image of a student bedroom where students have to click cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success and how important the sleeping routine is.
During the courses, students also learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of campuses is shown with interactive icons that encourage students to think about their daily routine.
\"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
However, we feel that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health, Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on full-night learning prior to exam continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of the student against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep helps also to fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts him in a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light ” that emits electronic devices screens, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after a hit by Dolly Menge cut down Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the match by beating Livingston with result 1 : 0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first victory on the run after triumph in February 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now trails eight points in Ladbrokes Prime Ministership for leading Hearts.
Menga achieved the event seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to have lost inspiration and did not seem to equalize the result.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbed third, with only one outcome of the difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on his hips and thus broke past Ayra to the semifinal Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston setup that Hearts took the measure last week and would be delighted that his well-designed set was stifled by every opponent's attempt.
The Rangers may have had more football in their possession, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had a chance to do this for two minutes after Menga was first thrown out of the game, which opened a space for Scott Pittman to move towards the naked Allan McGregor, however, the embroidery missed that opportunity.
The deep-free blow of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only have passed an imprecise blow to the back row.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game seemed to play with hope rather than with conviction.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that the judge was supposed to judge him in 15 minutes after his encounter with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson failed to grant him the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to point only two balls to the goal, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a blow to Lassan Coulibaly's head and the timbits of Ovie Eyaria were not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playoff of Livingston has slowed the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers once again missed using the deep Jacobs back ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his character and chose Menga for the simple end of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Couribally Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had its current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it off his line.
But Livingston continued to involve visitors in exactly the game they enjoy, while both Lithgow and Halkett had one long shot after the other.
Holt's side could have extended leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide entrance from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again late asked for an 11-year-old because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson took a look this time.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger counter
And now comes a page from our Almanah on the \"Sunday Morning\" show: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ... the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as Geiger counter.
As of that time, Geiger’s counter became the main point of pop culture, such as “Bells of Colorado ” in 1950, in which the main roles seemed to be the most amazing scientists of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is it, for God’s sake,
Rogers: “It's Geiger's counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms that react to the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “Look at that, it’s really loud.
\"Hans-Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name lives on.
A new anticancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see ” bad cells
A new anticancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see ” bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify poor cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes pulling cells of the immune system out of the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
The cells are treated to be able to “recogniz ” a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into a patient
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes pulling cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to know ‘recognition’ – a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine,
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovary, lung, and colon cancer, ” explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and their study – how to identify cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West became involved in the debate on Trump after visiting the Saturday Night Live show and supported it, wearing a cap with the inscription \"Let's Make America Great Again\"
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was scouted in the study during the Saturday Night Live show after a performance with interruptions praising US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription \"Let's Make America Great Again\", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
\"So often I talk to white people and they tell me: How you like Trump, he's a racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago, “he said.
Saturday Night Live's show began with a satirical sketch where Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the US Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's claims about sexual abuse.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's social media speech taped the comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was trying to mock West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being run down from the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
\"I was being harassed behind the stage.
They told me: “Don’t go anywhere with that hat.
I've been bullied!
They said I sank, “D.C. Examiner says.
West continued: “You want to see the bottom, ” and he said that he would wear his Superman robe because that means I can’t tell him what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try Love
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused at least twice the crowd’s discomfort, and members of Saturday Night Live’s show seemed disgraced, while one magazine person said: “The entire studio has quieted down.
West was called at the last moment as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West, dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, was astounded by the song “I love it”.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the TPUS Conservative Group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest people: Thank you for standing up to MAFI.
But the host of Karen Hunter on Twitter said that West simply \"was his own and that it was absolutely wonderful\"
\"But I choose NOT to reward someone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or by supporting his \"art\") for whom I believe he accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we, \"she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he is now \"will be officially known as Kanye West\"
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, who's also known by the names of Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased music legend Prince changed her name to a symbol, and then into an artist previously known as Prince.

The star of the series Game of thrones Kit Harrington turned to toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow who handles the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of the throne.
But a 31-year-old actor turned to a macho hero stereotype, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
Speaking for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Game of thrones series, admitted that he wanted to \"very determinedly\" to face this problem.
\"I personally feel very determined at this point – where we have sinned with the masculinity – he asked himself.
\"What we taught men, as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see,
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screen, could partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, and that makes boys feel like they have to have these certain lines of a man?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our age – how can we change that?
'Cause obviously, for boys, something went wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the series's series series series series Game of thrones after its end next summer and said that \"he had finished with the battles and horses\"
Since November, Kit will be performing a new performance by True West author Sam Shepherd, the story of a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that had happened to him during the game of the throne.
“I met my wife by recording this series, which she gave me a family and a future life, ” he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic show that won the Emmy Award playing Ygritte, the love of Keith's character, Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the property of Lesliena's family in Scotland.
HIV/IDA: China reported an increase in new cases of 14% disease
China has announced that 14% have increased HIV and AIDS populations.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which is a change in the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted across parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV almost doesn't have it.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a permanent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT is said to be high.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur due to inadequate sex protection.
As part of the effort to deal with this problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has issued information on GOP senators, calling it \"dangerous lies\" and \"theories of conspiracy\"
US Attorney-General Maxine Walters denied Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia's website.
A Democratic representative from Los Angeles assures that these claims spread to individuals – ultra right-wing – as well as to websites.
\"Lyst, lies and even more disgusting lies,\" Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication belongs to the Office of Agent Waters, as well as information on a representative member of staff, The Hill reported.
\"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false, \"she continued Waters.
“My staff member – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking that information.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false.
Mrs Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer.
“ This is an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
\"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
It has to be calm and steady.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism the Democrats made to Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of making him too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing against Waters in the general election, also tweeted on Twitter.
“ It’s important if it’s true, ” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had informed “the governing bodies and the authorities of the order ” about these false claims.
\"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear the legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet, \"she continued.
Review of the film \"Johnny English: Back on the Task – – Not Interesting enough Rowan Atkinson Fights spies
It is now common in every new British film to search for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also the new screening of the action series “Johnny English – whose first extension is called “Johnny English – the first time shown in 2003 and returned to the great screens entitled “Johnny English” –
Will a twisted own satire of how worthless we are apparently to become a new national export opportunity?
Unable Johnny English with his eyes and rubber face again has permission to complicate the situation, while his name more than anything says that it is a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a demented secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim on “dulated - glamors, reminds Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of the character of Mr Bean and kind of reminds him of that guy who sang a song “Chariots of Fire ” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics Games.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and the mysterious world man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and is the face of chaos.
There are one or two good-looking moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now when “severe” – film titles such as “007” and “Unable Missions – offer themselves elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, the demented stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's dim-gags emulated in Mr Bean's character.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a generally accepted fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy web site and discovered the identities of all British agents, the horror agent on duty, who, unfortunately, was played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw of the prime minister's patience, the overtrendious and warlike character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to demonstrate faithfully the character that should represent Theresa May, but she did not exactly get the material with which to create something.
Intelligence counselors reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as a principal of a class, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several hot gegs here because English teaches rock-style spying.
English is quickly brought into government rooms for an emergency meeting, where she meets with Bough again, her former partner and her eternal sacrifice, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now married to an excessively enthusiastic submarine commander, played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so the two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong are returning to action and meeting the beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletov, who was emboldened by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Walte played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous stories: disguised as waiters burn up a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess of smuggling on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English causes a complete anarchy by trying to use earphones for virtual reality to find out what the inside of the Voltina house looks like.
Everything was done properly for this final extension, but however attractive and ostentatious the film contains many children's elements.
It's quite a central achievement.
And as with other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself again, could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role to suit his talent?
Labour Party denies developing plan for the British to work four days a week, to be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will discuss a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly wants company heads to pass on to workers to save the results of an artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an extra day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend equal salary.
Sources suggest that the idea could “be integrated ” into the party economic programme and plans for the country to resort to the interests of workers.
The union congress supported switching to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times \"The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
\"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it is a tendency that fits the approach that this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of this party,
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept that tendency.
Labour Party spokesman said: \"A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it,
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to work out his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he decided to take power from the hands of “unspoiled directors ” and“ profittors ” in communal businesses.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their full role because the Labour Government could make ‘rejections’ based on observed irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to involve workers in the administrative boards of companies and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of private companies' capital to employees who would earn annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak for “60 Minutes ” about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court in at least a week's time and is asking the question of whether the agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, correspondent-60 Minutes- Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility that the FBI would reveal something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his fellow South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course,\" Kennedy said.
\"I said going to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they were brought out to you, and said, \"Have you done it?\"
He was determined, he was unshakable, he was unconstructed.
Graham's voice, however, is as if it were carved into stone.
\"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should make a strong accusation to change that – he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has taken everything decisively, ” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"None of the persons appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see that anything's changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project project, an international advocate group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or \"works – such as volunteering, e-mailing to the world leader, telephone calls, or any other meaningful means of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, considering that he remains 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called \"clictivism – where people feel that by signing online petitions or sending tweets they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that he has recorded more than 19 million - action - his supporters who have sought to achieve a number of different objectives.
It claims that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would result in an amount greater than $37 billion that by 2030 would have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors in the United Kingdom that advocates “helping children to develop to their full potential, with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda with the goal of completing underprivilegedness in the area.
“With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as yourself, we can achieve that social injustices of feeding become only a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to the Foundation “The Power of Nutrition – audiences at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken with the aim of improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the “The Power of Nutrition ” project, which will provide food intervention for 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the most common questions on its website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty,
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will have a failure.
But we will succeed, as did the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong to some of the performances at this year's event in New York that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a \"blockade\" - to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can, \"if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has discovered, according to weekly Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russian engagement is in Syria , especially where he acts on the invitation of a legitimate government , an excuse to explore new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is willing to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe, he says.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to address the problem.
\"The United States, with the assistance of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event hosted by a non-profit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the United States presents itself as “the voice of energy consumers, ”
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, saying they were actually the same.
\"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel – he said, and Russia says \"is served by the same trick – in fossil-fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as Trump's intention to increase exports of its natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, the officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the ‘indecent’ project of Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, was made by Berlin - the captives - Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers – Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has sparked a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German Industry Organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when the third country is involved in our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will \"severely consider – the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the state senator of the state of Massachusetts
The state senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would \"severely consider \"the run for president\" after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering running herself.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman in charge,\" The Hill quoted her as saying.
\"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president --
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during his meeting with the citizens, saying \"this country is heading in the wrong direction\"
“I’m terribly worried about Donald Trump doing our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote,
A poll, however, issued Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Research of the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent - likely - voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be running.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of the vote for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
The other prominent names of the Democrats that were discussed about the potential race for the president in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's stress at Donald Trump's rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up for September.
Arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that happened Monday night
\"What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and other wounds with which our soldiers return – said the audiences at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that his son and other war veterans said they were “returning a little bit different, coming back hard, coming back wondering if there was any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other army members, gave for this country,
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the application of family violence and arms possession in an alcoholicised condition, according to Dan Bennett, spokeswoman of the city's Wasilla Police Administration.
18 federal states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
The 18 states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and districts filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support a policy-disputing asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of prosecutors in the suit of Grace v. Sessions, which the U.S. Civil Freedom Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partners, violent members of his gang, abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum claim on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, coming from a number of asylum applicants in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and family violence.
A new asylum policy in the United States changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 that allowed immigrants who do not have documents to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia County State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy \"ignors decades of state, federal and international law\"
\"The Federal Law states that all asylum requests are settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle, as stated in the report of a friend of the court.
The lawyers further argued that the policy denying entry harms the US economy, arguing that it is more likely that it will become entrepreneurs and \"secure the necessary workforce\"
Chief Attorney-General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop approving asylum in June to victims fleeing family violence and gang violence.
\"Azil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion – Sesions said in a statement on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to mitigate all the problems that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palou as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more difficult.
\"The situation is very tense – said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in fever at the evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palou.
‘Security assistance vehicles shall be carried by the body every minute.
The government of poverty of clean water -
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, reading through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were convulsed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, rested in front of the Palou Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the open for continued severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was bent into the ruins of the wall, ” Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
\"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US Ambassador accuses China of \"maltretting – through - propaganda ads –
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of advertising in the US daily newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of US and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of abuse of the US press of spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's paid addition on Wednesday in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials have reported as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's reprisals at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and formerly long-standing governor Iowe, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has been harming US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “is now doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press,
\"During the expansion of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American free speech and free press tradition by putting paid ad in Des Moines Register, \"said Branstad.
“In contrast, on the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited voices of opposition and you will see no true reflection of the different opinions Chinese people may have about the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under firm pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that \"one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to make an offer to publish – his article, although he did not say which papers were in question.
Kavanaugh's debacle republicans draw voters away from the mid-term elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing by for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and defending him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite exciting, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot be returned, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University Faculty, said of an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
\"The women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow, nor in November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, citing a newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang: “The November - coming, protesting in the corridor of the Senate while the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee were preparing to continue their appointment in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
\"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond expectations – Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the news.
\"People say they are already high, which is true.
But they could be taller, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
\"It is a real mess for the Big Old Party,\" said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, in the beginning of last week, NBC News said.
\"It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh has been sent on the reserve bench, but also about the way the Republicans have joined and treated it – he pointed out for the news Guy Cecil, director of the USA's Priories Group, which helps with the election of Democrats.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided about which they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or likely believe in the truthfulness of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they must or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent claimed the same thing for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations Ford has made, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Board last week on oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court's candidate showed her his genitals at a party during a study at Yale in 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops based on Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
The Solid allows users to select a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that the intention behind the Inrupt - World Domination -
\"We have to do this now – he said, referring to the startup.
\"This is a historic moment-
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own \"personal Network Data Storage\" or \"PoD\".
It can include lists of contacts, list of obligations, calendar, musical library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision on who can access which information is fully user-friendly.
The company calls it “personal Encouragement through Data –
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as voluntary programmers' communities.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world could create their own decentralisationd applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn overnight.
\"We are not asking their permission.
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on the solid,
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Technology Institute of the State of Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in debate about the neutrality of the network.
Even while running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
\"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network, according to Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Priests of World War I of Victoria’s Cross · Global Voices
The celebrations in honor of the only priest of the Church of Anglican who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, a sniper killed him and never found out that he had won the greatest British military honor.
The monumental stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that “it is amazingly symbolic that the stone will be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s undertaking for which he received the confession.
According to the London Gazette official report, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentin's channel “through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the field and machinery.
Later, he rushed to the front lines and “incredible bravery, leading the unit forward before chasing down the Polish cannon without any help and cutting down three from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - something more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the works of his grandfather were “something I knew I could never achieve, and which incites humility,
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “feels very honored to be part of the parade, ” adding that“ the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give,
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Dusty Peppu
Imagine this - stay awake all night to watch down the Bellator matches 206 so your main event is ultimately impossible to follow.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK, live on channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Great Britain remained in shock when the transmission ended the Dusty Peppa.
Many were not at all impressed after staying awake until early morning just for fighting.
One fan of child cartoon transmission on Twitter described it as “a kind of sick joke.
\"By the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 o’clock in the morning, so they had to transfer to the children’s program, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communications of Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
\"Jupi, \"Peppa Pear\"
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include future viewers from Britain.
\"When I consider reruning, I think we can probably work something out,” Coker said.
\"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to implement anything until Sunday comes in for us, when it will already be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut, there were a lot of correspondence that wasn't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
The problem is state nature.
I can promise you next time, it won't come to that.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we normally do, and we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"inferiority\" about sexuality
The Olympic Jumper in the Water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty - four - year - old man said that until he left for high school he was unaware that “not everyone like me -
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was talking about gay rights to give others hope –
He also said winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular director of a long-standing show, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of the disease.
Showing up as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up, he felt “less worthy than others because“ it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day these feelings of inferiority and diversity were real things that gave me power and strength to succeed.
He says that he wanted to prove that he was someone and something... so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist became a prominent person who advocated LGBT and used his performance at the Commons Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hopeful ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man named American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the difference in years was never a problem for him.
“When you’re so young you’re going through so much, ” he looked back at his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, said it’s hard to find someone the same age and he experienced similar ups and downs.
In June they became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “all perspective ” had changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, all the stories would be that I 'must win the gold medal',\" he said.
\"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things that he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row,\" he said.
\"I held his hand as he exhaled, and only after he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible – he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
\"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life \"to jump in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,\" he said.
It was also an inspiration for choosing the first song . \" Proud , singer Heather Small , who echoed in it during the preparation of the Olympic Games .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Wilder Cup game, but he will have to regain his full form in order to avoid an awkward turnoff.
Mickelson, who in this two-year competition plays the record twelveth time on the bench sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturdays with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and developing his game at the gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for a demanding field of Le Golf National, where long irregular terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if I'm field is not scary enough, Mickelson faces the precise British Open Frenchco Molinari on Sunday's 9th match, which won all four matches with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get to the hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said that he trusted his man more than that and couldn't tell.
\"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, embraced me and said he would be ready tomorrow, \" Furyk said.
“There is much confidence –
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's what we should do.
He wants to be on the ground, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's number of Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought certain intangible values to the team.
\"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny and he's a great guy for it, he explained.
\"I think the younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game –
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the great advantage of the last day of the Ryder Cup single matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant race.
Danac debuted in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Svea Ballesteros took advantage of five points against the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference from 141-2 to 131-2.
\"You are constantly recalling that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a close difference, – said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team, which won 5 - 3 on Friday and yesterday led the result of 10 - 6 on the field of Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play hard tomorrow.
Get out in the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors are put on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are quite aware of who is standing against us, the biggest players in the world.
Enthusiful with the performance of his players on the hard golf course, Bjørn added: “I would never run before oro in this.
Tomorrow we face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when it's all going well, but when you're there as an individual, they're at the ultimate exam of your golfer's ability.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and she's gonna have to give the best of it tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate because he has to do the best of his own,
Unlike Björn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those big turns the last day, since he was part of the Brooklyn winning team before he ended up a loser after Europe performed \"Monster in Medina\"
\"I remember every damn word – he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
\"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start just like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that kick goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle swords.
In line with that, we organized our set-up and set up guys like we're gonna, you know, try to do magic tomorrow--
Thomas was assigned an assignment to try to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahma, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I've decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it includes everything, said Bjørn about the selected individual match players.
German new warship put back on hold
The German Navy's newest frigate was to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it will not be ready until next year due to faulty systems and cost hikes, local media reported.
The launch in the transport of the ship – Rheinland-Pfalz – the leading ship of a brand-new class frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit's newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery they hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, there will be a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and countership missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - the latest frigates should be possible during a period of up to two years without returning to the port of birth.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships – which Germany is said to allow to show power abroad – will already become obsolete by the moment of entry into service, notes Die Zeit.
Last year, the unfortunate F125 frigate reached all the front pages, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilding ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited many key \"software and hardware deficiencies\" that would make the warship useless if it were sent to combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important because ships of class Baden-Wuerttemberg will operate a crew of about 120 sailors – half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved to be dramatically too heavy to reduce its efficiency and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached an startling 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) in comparison to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Petersen Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is actually \"disposing of ships capable of deploying –
The official said the problem increased over time, as the old ships were placed outside the plant and there were no substitute vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the class frigates Baden-Württemberg could join the Navy.
The National Foundation listens to the secret life of bats
New surveys carried out at the Scotland Highland estate aim to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will be followed by regular and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long and river bats in the Gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using hand detectors.
The professional analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the vote of the bats and what kind of it does.
Then a map of habitats and reports will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of the nature of the NTS, hopes to find out what areas of habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of operations on habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and works on design that affect shelters and loss of habitats.
Windturbine and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as muholic and certain chemical treatments of construction material, and pet cats' attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, who is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeves estate in Dumfrees and Galloway, where there are eight out of the ten species of bats that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says that the property is an ideal area for them.
\"Here in Threeveh we have a huge space for bats,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
There is, however, much more that we do not know about bats, so that the work we do here and on other facilities will help us understand better what they need for progress –
Stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work within buildings, since unintentional destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Association for the Protection of Bats, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don’t know how their population progresses.
Ronaldo rejects rape claims as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as “false news, ” saying that people“ want to promote themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced these accusations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her $35,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In the live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the indictment, Ronaldo, 33, he criticised allegations as \"false news\"
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news, says the five - time gold ball winner in the camera.
\"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine, adding a football player with a smile.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions, ” writes Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that a football player would seek compensation for \"moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years,
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in the hotel and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After the night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayor reportedly returned to the football room, where she was allegedly anally raped, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorra claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that \"99 percent\" was the \"good guy\" who was failed by that \"one percent\"
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that he was in agreement.
Mayorra also claims that she went to the police and they took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she “were afraid of reprisals ” and was worried that she would be“ publicly humiliated.
Thirty-four-year-old girl says she now wants to dismiss the settlement because she remains traumatised by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing into Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will regret it forever – losing car manufacturers
The UK \"will regret forever – if Brexit loses the status of the world's car-making leader after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that \"it is worrying – that the UK's Toyota told the BBC that, in the event of Britain leaving the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need a deal, Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting at the borders in the Brexit case without an agreement could result in job loss.
The Burnaston drive, produced by Toyotu Auris and Avensis , produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
\"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March, we will experience production delay in our factory – said Marvin Cooke, Kyoto's CEO in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers voiced fears about leaving the EU without agreement over possible consequences for cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers concerns supply chain risks in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyot's production line functions according to the principle of “government at the time – where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operating at order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at its Derbyshire factory couldn't hold more supplies than they needed for a day, said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the \"Chequers\" plan – offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU – was specifically calibrated to avoid these checks at the border –
\"We have to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only the maintenance of the current success, but also take this opportunity – he told the BBC Radio 4 programme today.
“The evidence not only of Toyote, but also of other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain range –
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the industry's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston and who is a member of the Union Union trade union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “By my experience, once these jobs leave, they never return. ”
The government's spokesman says: \"We have set out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU,
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, the White House says
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, as Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues to fight, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the elections, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire a deputy state's attorney and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been spreading gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he left for the White House in the middle of announcing he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that \"I would not like to be fired by Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing, which witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
On the questions about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not specified, it could be postponed this week; and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account everything else that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not the result of a disrepute on the “theatrical behavior of television reporters, although she said:“ I will not oppose the fact that they are being dissembled,
Then she suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
\"The president organises more meetings for answers to questions than any president before them – she said, adding without giving evidence: \"We have analyzed numbers –
A brief address will continue, Sanders said, but \"if journalists have the opportunity to directly question the President of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We try to make that possible often, and you could see that in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks to the press –
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York City, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
Health Minister sent a letter to an EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the withdrawal of the UK to withdraw from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to subsidising the costs of submitting applications for EU citizens working in its decentralisationd public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions of this fall.
But the United Kingdom government also boosts preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would now like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members from across the EU, as well as wider ones, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here -
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
Line team player Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after having suffered head injury on Saturday's defeat by the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a score of 31-27, reports Mike Authority of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury took place just before the half-time.
\"He reached the line of the playground and just collapsed,\" Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put him on the stretcher and sent him on further search.
A representative of the state University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had exited operations at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there are no \"details about the type/range of the injury\" and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of dance internship, played the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shootings before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservative plans, a higher tax will be charged to foreign customers when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom , and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's success to attract young voters to promise that it will provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high salaries.
The increase in the fee will be charged by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
An additional charge , which is collected to the current fee, including an increase introduced two years ago on other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issuing , may be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects 120 million pounds per year to be collected by this move.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are being bought by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases the prices and difficulties of customers who buy the first real estate to participate in the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country , especially in the capital , have become “ghost cities ” because of the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a number of young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the country, and urged Mrs May to give up the quota for affordable properties to repair \"the shame over the housing situation\" in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposed series of attractive residential reforms, including rent controls and zero-provoked actions.
He also wants to give the council greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the restoration of the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means repairing our low-income housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies formed abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British ones.
The dream of having a home has become too far gone for many people, and the shame of homelessness continues to be very real.
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland\"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says that his “extreme ambition ” is one day to become governor of Scotland.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, which is currently third in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer, he moved to the St. Mirren Stadium of Lights after again last season at the Scottish football championship.
\"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that was it, ” Ross told BBC Scotland.
\"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hamden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, this opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful at managing the club –
Ross' predecessors as Warden of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poett and Paul Di Cania.
Former head of the Allo Athletics says he didn't feel fear because he inherited such famous names in such a large club after he had previously refused calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"The success for me at this time will be measured to see if I can return this club to the Prime Minister League.
Because of its structure and content, this club no doubt belongs to the Prime Minister League, he said.
\"It's not easy to get there, but I probably would only consider myself successful if I could take the club back there.
Ross only completes his third year's management career after a period during which he was the assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Allo recover from falling out into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the champions next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
\"It was probably a real intersection – the takeover of Allo was remembered.
\"I really believed that managing what suits me is more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making a solid living, and enjoying a pretty successful time.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure work, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever felt in my life.

The perfect time for the pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, according to the survey
The summer heat wave increased revenues to British audiences who struggled with finance, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars achieved an increase in income in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Business Books Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the nice time and participation of England in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the pubs’ incomes rose by 2.8 percent, with the fact that restaurants were now even more affected.
A 1.8% drop in the revenues of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions than the losses the restaurants suffered.
The pubs where food is mostly used also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to come out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over the month and food sales dropped by three per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM's holiday and catering analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors in terms of foreign sales.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent at the annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food - serving local leaders, and the weather would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would give us much needed rest –
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the share of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operating groups, with total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One of five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of five children, some of whom only age 11, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
A 20,000 high school survey showed an increase in the number of -false Insta - pages
News has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main ” account showing parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, are opening secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of -false Instase accounts - a reference to the photo sharing website.
The news has increased fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a cleared - up “main ” account to show their parents, while at the same time having private bills.
One mother who came across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged other words \"rape me\"
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit that they own private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is disturbing that many teenagers try to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them –
Eilidh Doyle will be \"Athlete's Voice – in the Scottish Athletics Committee\"
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as the non-executive director of the annual administrative body's assembly.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to use her wide-ranging experience internationally over the past decade.
\"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee – Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland –
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters race in 1996 in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic gold, and now he is a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I would recover and to what extent.
It was difficult, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the message of encouragement –
Shared opinions on online advertising for a traitor comparing mothers with cows
A publishing company compared its breast-feeding mothers to the cows that the muse triggered divided opinions on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be “the first silent carrier in the world, Elvie for consumer technology published ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn filled with hay and cows with music whose text says: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see any tail, and “In case you haven’t noticed, this is not a udder, these are my breasts.
Then the reference follows: “pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, pump, pump, milk your ladies husband –
However, advertising, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, and many say that the lighting of the milk industry is terrible.
\"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except for their children to steal several days after birth, one person wrote.
The Elvie publisher is discreetly fit into the Mother's bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Certainly traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies -
Someone added: \"Fullly lame advertising-
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that her song was “mixture. ”
\"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I still had the breast, I'd buy one.
Betraying milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertise's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a genius product, she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial aimed at milk - issuing moms (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and they feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad praising or condemning the dairy industry –
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet traitors located in bras.
The concept of campaigning is based on the fact that many milk producers say they feel like cows.
The betrayer Elvie, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and is discreetly fit into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, keep their babies and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The publisher Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves courageous and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put into the spotlight the betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way an incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time the betrayer Elvie's ever made the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors without escorting.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been reported in criminal records.
\"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's sponsorship are illegal, and many of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals, said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, in order to speed up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days, which was a standard earlier.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not personally, to bring their case to legal status before the immigration court.
Those who fail to meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, more likely to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
The advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Thornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that the signs of the child's struggle will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria commands US, French and Turkish \"ocupation forces\" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Mouelem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the rule of fighting terrorism, and would \"in accordance with that and deal with them\"
\"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, \" he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, while millions lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “a fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories were cleared, from terrorist groups and “any illegal presence of foreigners,”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who practice and advise and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-damaged country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed some Western countries for the spread of irrational fears that prompted refugees not to return.
\"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns, he said.
\"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue,
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help restore Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel foothold created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a mass attack by Syrian forces, with the support of Russia in a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed to Jihadists, including the Nusra fronts associated with Al-Qaeda, \"which will be eradicated\"
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and opposition to form a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the terms for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the committee should be limited \"to reviewing the articles of the current constitution\" and warned against interference.
Why will Trump win second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, which many liberal viewers are likely hoping, recall and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would no doubt be the most dramatic finals of the presidency,
There are no signs of fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and have almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC’s show, the Rachel Maddow Show, exceeded ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers at the evenings of the main news broadcast.
\"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something that we don't understand,' said Neal Baer producer ABC drama-Designated Survivor, a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy author and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaping Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club – has a different theory.
It remembers taxi rides in Boston before 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
\"Why \", she asked.
He replied: “Because she makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on abortion of the Roe v. Wade procedure, whether the immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you exceed the level of informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for the sixth hour discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of deep background for his book \"Fear\" about Paul Manafort's jacket from an amateur's skin worth $15,000 (“a garment full of bravado“ written by Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never, ever look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
“A part of what he does makes you feel like a reality show is that it feeds you every night, ” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and a show maker – Zagaonica – about rotating acting position and everyday complications of Trump’s show (fights with N.F.L., praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you're going to be left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleis this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Justice Board, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging about the end.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr. Fleiss.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money on the outside flows into the most uncertain mid-term election race for congress
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reshuffle of congress districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights Democratic Conor Lambo , who won the post in the second district last spring in special elections.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were rewritten after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were consolidated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign fight between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed special March elections for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
The position held a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. is asking if they should punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdraw
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the company's management team.
Officials from the State Department decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over \"stretty decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore\" said Heather Nauert.
However, fines were considered only against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million of US aid in 2017 for, among other things, narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings advanced, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, considered progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, high officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus had actually interrupted any examination of the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new difficult messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates under anonymity.
Their reports confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing you know, could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, on which there is now significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly also directed his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to step forward again, and perhaps ultimately, the jury of his plains.
It is very quiet – and I do not wish to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr. Truma - or those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler, only to stand up to him and support the Chehologicals in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History turns around the points of infleksia, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or late.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflectia points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy state's attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he had proposed secretly last year to record the president and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
\"How are we going to respond if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair \" or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite compelling charges of sexual assault and unfair testimony,
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections to Congress which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I trust you're not gonna fall for a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the sabbath candles on that table with a jagged cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future -

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive remi in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League.
Knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season to remium of 2 - 2 with Villarrreal, but believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for larger things.
\"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent – said a 31-year-old.
\"We got into the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but in general, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better at second.
There is another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The boys are good and the boys are really enjoying themselves; the training's good.
Let us hope that we will be able to continue now, leave last season behind and be successful –
Women can't sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what they wanted, few people talked about it with family members.
Around half of the study subjects, Nationwide said they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
\"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to start a conversation, said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in setting costs.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you figure out a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance hybrid with a value of money that will help you cover these costs or self-preservation with your own wealth, as long as you have the money.
Take care of your legal documents: Stop legal battles in the root.
Hire healthcare professionals to identify a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving the power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent finds a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give details in the written plan so that you will be ready.
\"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are,\" Martin asked.
\"What are the medicines?

An earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Pal on Friday, officials said, and an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
Since communications were interrupted, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala province, areas north of the Palua, which is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palou.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a county that stretches over 300 km of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Sulawesi province, in particular the coastal regions of Donggala.
Nicl mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Pal and Donggala were hit several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia disaster relief agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on a seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesia province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami hit on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the island of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: A shallow earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jay in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died from the collapse of buildings.
2018.: The great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 people killed, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, former governor of Alaska's eldest son and vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 28, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, a report released Saturday by a state police officer in Alaska said.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-su and is held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the issue of pleas was declared innocent, of course, by the network.
The Palina is charged with three Class A offenses, which means you could be in jail for up to a year and fined with a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B violations, punishable by one day's prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and the possession of weapons in an alcoholic condition associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised veteran groups in 2016 after connecting the violent behavior of her son with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed after Friday's earthquake struck by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power networks and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a direct proximity to central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palou when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed, a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to attack a bike track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he cut down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saiov killed eight victims and “intentionally ” committed a serious physical injury, according to a report of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern New York district.
Both points lead to a possible death sentence, in accordance with the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of Shaipov hit a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “silent planning and premeditation, ” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saip carried him out as “disgusted, cruel and corrupt. ”
“Sayfulo Habibulavic Saip caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Earli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” notes.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the south of New York County handled the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was the last carried out in a federal case in New York, 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 on the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He's not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing the Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed, by the prosecution’s decision.
\"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of letting it go, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Parliament's conservative member says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize the National Army, during a protest at a Conservative Conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to \"feel the pressure - Eurosceptics - since one of the members of the Theresa May Parliament proposed that he be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said the Birmingham processions that the United Kingdom would have \"exited\" by now, that Mr. Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May found herself at reconciliation with her deep-divided ranks emphasize the Tory's tendency to stick together to a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan \"Chequers – in the midst of the attacks by supporters Brexit, the rest of the EU is also in favour.
The Allies insisted that she would continue her attempts to make an agreement with Brussels despite the reactions and force Eurosceptics and laburists to choose between her package and the \"Choice\"
Mr. Bonne said at a campaign rally “Leave Mens Leave, in Solihullo, that he wants to “reject Chequers ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now – he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers –
Bringing his opposition to the EU, he said: \"We did not fight in world wars to be subjected.
We want to make our own laws in our country,
Mr. Bonne dismissed allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely incorrect –
Conservatives and supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns were also in the procession, addressing the press as saying: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject Chequers and start listening -
In a prominent note, Mrs May added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises –
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to \"feel the pressure\" if they are about to fail the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
\"It's about trust between us now -- people -- and our political class -- he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'that won't work out for you.\"
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We Mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
A lot of activists waved to the banners, the Torici vs Brexit, after the group launched this weekend.
Laburist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
\"These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology for the \"Canada Plus\" plan for an undisturbed border situation, for free trade without borders in Ireland,\" he added.
\"It is all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit - he added.
Warren plans \"to seriously consider - to run for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she \"will seriously consider running for president – after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday in direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a re-election in November against Republican Jeff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
He's been at the centre of speculation for some time now to stand up to Trump in 2020.
Meeting Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that implies a woman's head.
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of basketball players at Louisiana State University (LSU) Wade Sims that happened on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11am, at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they posted a tape of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near campus Southern University.
\"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to the head and ended up dead as a result of it, \" Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and owned the murder weapon and that he killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken into custody by the county police of East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a third-year-old student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in 10 first sets last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion's title after his order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order - would play a major role in the race -
From the initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two laps and urging Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton in traffic at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the wheel wheel action, which made Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the free interior in danger of falling behind after a double move in defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race as he trusted his tires to score a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
At last he arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he's a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team did an extraordinary job of achieving a formal finish, said Hamilton.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein at a meeting Saturday over her insisting that she did not release a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate proved that people are “bad and bad and dishonest”
\"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, nasty and dishonest, he said.
“ When you look at publishing and leaking information in public, and then they say, ‘ Oh, I didn’t do it.
I did not do it.”
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - ‘aaa, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't - he added an imitation senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had arrived from her office.
\"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release her story to the public; Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
\"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret, which she asked for.
However, her denial did not come across the approval of the president, who said at the meeting Saturday night: “Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body language.
It may not be, but I have never seen a body - language worse in my life -
By continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidates, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own ends.
\"They are determined to return power at all costs.
You see the bad, the bad, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to the authorities, and they say, the president, the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5  – 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for defeating the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5-3.
In the early minutes, the Giants came up with the advantages of two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home to the equation, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equated for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen provided victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came out of the background and beat Dundee with a score of 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams season, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening match arrived in the fourth minute, precisely at 3:35, with Kendal McFaull's assistant David Rutherford for doubling leadership by hitting Beauvilleer four minutes later.
In the hasty opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt enabled Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with leadership when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals regrouped, and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in measuring their forces naked at 27.37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of winning when his team had already been halfway to the winnings in the last third of the game.
Giants, who have lost four since the last five games, host teams from Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid earthquakes
A traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while ensuring a safe take-off of aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are reported missing after a major earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the town of Palou.
However, despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport control tower, which was rocking hard.
It remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
\"Our heart is breaking because of it – he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
\"The death toll is believed to have continued to increase, since many of the bodies are still under ruins and many could not be reached – Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokeswoman of the agency, said.
Waves reaching height and up to six feet [6 m] destroyed the palace where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The ambulances drive every minute of the body's transport.
The government's poverty of clean water.
Small shops are being looted everywhere –
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: \"The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse –
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in the country on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? It's CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the Lagoon
The airline that owned the aircraft that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Mitrovica now claims that one man is being driven missing, after 47 passengers and crew members were previously said to have been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon they can't trace one of the passengers.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane went into the water while trying to land in the airport of Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in stable condition.
Which caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remained unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
\"That's very good,\" said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to break through the water that went through their waist to the exit in case of the danger of the plane that went down.
He said the stewardesses panicked and yelled and suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who worked nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue using a boat to blow people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that the PNG registered aircraft accidents have killed 111 people in the last two decades, but that none of them included Air Niugini.
An analyst exhibits a weather check on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution completed the case Saturday in a retrial to a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone data to put together a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was obtained with several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers' evening when she was killed, contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was \"syllable because his truck was in Nashville. \"
Another inconsistency was what Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact details.
\"He erased it from his life,\" Hale said.
The defense is due to begin the closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial later that day to be sent to the jury.
What's a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop Trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a singing group in Bristol, claims that hip-hop music has strayed from its beginnings filled with political messages and a focus on social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in the UK through artists such as Akal and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
New York nanny sues a couple for quitting after \"racist\" messages
A New York nanny sues a couple for being discriminated against after receiving a misdirected message from a mother calling her \"another black woman\"
A couple deny that they're racists, comparing the charge with \"extremely\"
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was unhappy when she found out after her first working day in 2016 that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEE ONE MORE BLACK - Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her wife.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she was sent twice by Mrs. Maurice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an awkward situation and fired Mrs. Maurice because she claimed that their former nanny, who was African-American, was badly involved in her work, and that she was expecting a Philipinka instead, was quoted as New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and asking for $350 per day damages for a period of six months originally engaged, though without a contract.
\"I want to show them that I can't do things like that – she told Post on Friday, adding: \"I know it's discrimination.
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying that ending Maurica's employment was reasonable, because of the fear that they would not be able to trust her after that.
\"My wife didn't mean for sending her a message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, said husband Joel Plasco for Post.
\"But would you trust your children to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco said his wife only got two months' maternity leave after the baby was born and was in a “very difficult situation” –
\"You will sue someone in such a situation
\"It's not very nice – the investment banker added.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: “It’s difficult to put into someone’s skin before publishing who will read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before the little stuffed bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as “a very important member of the family, ” added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
\"There was quite a quiet man and he was not a boaster – she said.
\"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was seen as some achievement of your own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your doing.
I think Padddington's success was seen that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
\"Nad regularly called to say that it is really bad and that they believe it will not get away – Mrs Ednan-Laperous said.
\"Then Nas invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be joining you soon.
I'll join you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to maintain her heart rate were slowly losing its effect and leaving her body system.
She died just before boarding, and that's when it all went out.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing what would happen.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all in,
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who was already in mourning for losing her daughter at the time, boarded the plane along with other passengers -- who were not aware of the temptations she was going through.
\"No one knew, she said.
\"I put my head down, and my tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
\"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day,\" she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a brighter career.
\"They all remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill each room with joy –
But before he died, he left his job because he was in “a dark state. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after this one took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect –
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards - how people would know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not sit in silence - you need to talk -
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
\"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that,\" she said.
\"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened presents, didn't look them in the eye or wanted anything else -
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “It leaves a huge hole in the family.
Kid of us.
But we'll move on and fight

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on until the FBI launches an investigation.
\"I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we really could get something like what he was looking for -- a time and scope of the limited investigation -- Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was falling \"in the midst of a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their insolence was triggered by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections are due in just five weeks, November 6th – if, expected, Republicans are not going well, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to bring the desired man to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush constantly called upon the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its own report?
It will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republican and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the voting vote and confirm his position at the Supreme Court.
The number of defectes from North Korea 'fall' led by Kim
The number of defections from North to South Korea dropped after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Invoking data from the United South Union ministry, Park Byeong-seug said last year there were 1127 defections , compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors of stricter control are at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment.
The vast majority of defections from the north eventually received South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's defection is considered illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South , which are still technical in the war , have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denucleisation negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work in a broader sense to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
\"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not up to us, under such circumstances, to disarm ourselves first, said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysteric\" unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate - hysterical - and said that because of her temperament, she was incapable of serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, she would call it \"hysteric,\" Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school age.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him \"gross and co-ordinated blacking\" – organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that it could not participate in the Supreme Court's work, as he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
\"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats – she said.
Asked if they would try to recall Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get most in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has recoiled.
\"I'll tell the following -- if she's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then she's not only capable of being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court she's in right now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the federal appeals court in Colombia County.
Pelosi added that she is concerned as a Democrat about the potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Accessibility Care or Law on Disposal of Prostecologists in the Roe v. Wade procedure, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether to amend some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“ It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
The justified criticism, anger that has been gathering for months and years, cannot be resolved without pay.
\"We cry when we get angry – Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be an executive and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she talks to says: ‘ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was excellent.
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where men were dominated, is that one time I was crying for unspoken anger, an older woman, a cold lady who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me to the staircase.
\"Don't ever let them see you cry, she told me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they'll think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
\"It was not a well designed decision, she told me through laughter 30 years later.
\"There have already been seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them \"Snow White and Seven Dwarves\"
As the campaign was already up, it was behind with fundraising, and she vowed not to enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters who gave men 1,000 dollars each gave her only 250 bucks.
“Do they think I have a discount, ” she wondered.
While she was saying she wasn't going to launch a formal campaign, she was so consumed with emotion, she was grateful to the people who supported her, she was frustrated with a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger for sexism that her throat got tight.
\"You would think that I had a nervous breakdown – Mrs. Schroeder remembered the reaction of the media to it.
\"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my gravestone.
\"She cried.
How trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the United States and China has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from the end, conflict between countries can be of benefit to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation in this week emerged with new customs which affected 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), in fact taxing half of all the goods that came to the United States of China.
Beijing has fought back in some way every time, and a customs duty of five to ten percent has recently been imposed on 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has promised to strike the US with a blow, and the world's second largest economy will certainly not turn itself in soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by yielding demands, but public obedience to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays his cards well, pressures from the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
\"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic fragmentation in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed – said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate for strategic reflection that focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is \"ready to return refugees\", said Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing to help rebuild a country that has destroyed a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
\"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safer thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism – he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of destroyed terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be welcome to help rebuild the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the conditional aid or the assistance of the countries sponsored by the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 – 10.5 in the field of Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again while the team of Danish Captain Thomas Björn reached the 14.5 points they were supposed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has been struggling for almost the entire tournament, to the 16th hole pair 3, sent a ball into the water at the first punch, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliantly in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since 1979 started this format.
The American Jordan Spietha kicked Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest-ranked European team player, with 5 & 4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became European with the highest win in the tournament with 25.5 points in career.
\"I don't normally cry, but I can't stop the tears today.
It's been a tough year.
I was so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the Cup again.
It's all about the team. I'm glad I could help, said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He conveys the torch to his countryman John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, score 2 & 1 in individual games on Sunday.
\"I feel incredible pride because of the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play – said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US Captain Jim Furyk said: “I'm proud of these guys, they fought...
At certain times, we have given resistance to Europe.
We failed.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
