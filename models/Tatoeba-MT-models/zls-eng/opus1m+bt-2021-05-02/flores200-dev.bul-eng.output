The amendment to the proposal was already accepted by both Chambers in 2011.
A change was made during this legislative session when the second sentence was first deleted from the Chamber of Representatives, and then adopted in a similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which offers the ban on one-half civil marriages, could likely open a door to civil marriage in the future.
Following the process, the HJR-3 decision will be reviewed in 2015 or 2016 by the next elected legislative authority to continue the process.

People used chairs to hit the windows, but the windows didn't break.
Survivor Francisek Koval said that one of the glass finally broke and they started coming out the window,
Because of the energy obtained in uniting hydrogen atoms (or merging them) to form heavier elements, the stars emit light and heat.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthesis reactors.
The steel needle is held on the surface of the water due to the surface tension.
The reason for the surface tension is that the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create invisible skin on its surface, allowing things like the needle to float from above.
The blade of the modern cane has a double edge with a dent in the middle. The two edges provide a better grip on the ice, even at a slope.
The edge, which is in contact with the ice, is also curved as the lower part of the blade is slightly curved until it leans to one side or the other.
This allows the skater to bend. If the skates lean left, the skater turns left, if the skates lean right, the skateboard turns right.
They need to get rid of the extra energy they receive from the light to return to their previous energy level.
They do so by transmitting small particles of light called ‘Photos’
This process is called by scientists “stimulated radiation radiation, because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing photons to emit, and light is a form of radiation.
The next picture shows a broadcast photon atoms. In fact, of course, photons are much smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are smaller than the matter that builds atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, eventually the spiral in the bulb burns and it no longer works.
The bulb should be changed after that. You should be careful when changing the electrical bulb.
First, the switch for the lighting body or the cable shall be turned off.
This is because electricity that flows into the contact where the metal part of the bulb is located can cause a strong electric shock. This can happen if you touch the inner part of the contact or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in contact.
The main organ of the blood system is the heart, which has the function of blood pump.
Blood drifts away from the heart through pipes called “arterials ” and returns back to the heart on a tube called “venees, ” the smallest pipes are called“ capillaries, ”
Triceratops could chew with its teeth not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, triceratops ate cicadas, which are a species of plant common during the chalk period.
These plants are like tiny palm trees with a crown of sharp, barbed leaves.
The triceratops may have used his healthy wood to paint the leaves before he ate the stem.
There are also scientists who argue that these plants are very toxic and it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, although in these days sloths and other animals such as parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poison leaves or fruits.
How would I be attracted to Jo's gravity? If you step on his surface, you'll weigh less than when you're on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds (16 kg) of Jo. Gravitation, of course, will act less.
Unlike Earth, the sun doesn't have a crust to step on, it's all built by gases, fire and plasma.
The gas goes off at a distance from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun that we see when we look at it is called the “Photosphere, ” or“ The Ball of Light, ”
The Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the Moon about 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The phases happen because only the sun-turned side of Venus (or the moon) is lit up. The phases of Venus support Kopernik's theory that the planets orbit the sun.
Then, several years later, in 1639, the English astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed the transit of Venus.
England has been experiencing a long peace period since Denlo's re-invasion.

There's a lot of theories about how Sanskrit came along, and one of them is about migrating from the West Aryans who brought their tongues with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The world's earliest famous book was written on Sanskrit, and after the accumulation of the Spanish Sanskrit simply faded because of the hierarchy.
As Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has served as a source of many contemporary Indian languages.
With the completion of the battle for France, Germany began to prepare to invade the British island.
The code name of the attack on Germany is “Operation Siilayan – Most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost during its evacuation by Dunkerk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German fleet (Kriegsmarine) and could destroy any alien ships sent through Lamansha.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were located near the likely routes of invasion, as the Admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air strikes.
To begin with the explanation of Italy’s plans, Italy was mainly the “little brother ” of Japan and Germany.
There was a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although four new ships were built just before the war began.
In order to conquer these countries, they had to own a platform so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
So they needed to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian warships did not have to do anything else.
Like Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long period of time.
The submarines were used during World War I and were then very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
At the beginning of the war, they mainly traveled to the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate, in order not to be noticed, the submarines were forced to sail underwater.
German submarines are called “seaboats, ” the Germans were very good at navigation and management of their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after their war they are not trusted to possess many of them.
Yes, King Tutancamon, sometimes called King Tutt or The King Boy, is one of the most famous ancient Pharaohs of ancient times.
Interestingly enough, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not recorded in most of the lists of ancient kings.

We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Omir - the legendary blind poet, who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems “Iliada – and Odysseus – is probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Sophocles and Aristophan are still popular dramatists, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, already known with his famous theorem of the links between the sides of the rectangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is believed that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used language in the world.
The number of speaking local languages varies depending on whether the very closely related dialects are counted or not.
The estimated estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in the dictionary’s composition, but they are written differently; the speakers in both languages can usually be understood in everyday conversations.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under Germany's strong cultural influence.
In their desire to draw God closer to local people, some German monks invented the Estonian literal language.
It is based on the German alphabet, adding one letter to the letter ‘ anyone’.
Over time, many words borrowed from the German language have landed. This was the beginning of enlightenment.

Learning to create interactive media requires the usual and traditional skills, as well as instruments learned in interactive classes (storship, editing of audio and video, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to overestimate your perceptions of media production and learn to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires the components of one project to connect with each other, but also make sense as a separate unit.
Focal complexity and the number of lens elements necessary to achieve a range of focus lengths is much greater than in the ordinary lenses, and this is the lack of enlargement lenses.
This problem is getting smaller as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This allowed increased lens to produce quality pictures, which is compared with the lenses with fixed focus length.
Another lack of enlargement lenses is that usually the maximum lens aperture (speed) is lower.
This makes cheap scale lenses hard to use without flash at low levels of light.
Among the most common problems with trying to convert a DVD film is overscanning.
Most TVs are designed to satisfy the wide audience.
That's why everything you see on television, it's with cut edges on the top, on the bottom and on the side.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called an image that exceeds the frame of the screen.
When you make a DVD, its ends, unfortunately, will most likely be cut off and if the video has a subtitre too close to the bottom end, they will not be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, shouting into the mind images of tournaments, parchments and the knightly spirit of King Arthur.
Although standing among millenniums is not hard to hear sounds and smell the scents of long past battles, you can almost hear the tape of the hoofs on the slopes and smell the fear of the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are castles even built? How are they designed and built?
The castle “Krby Mukslow ” is typical of this period and looks more like a fortified house than a real castle.
The big glass windows and the thin walls wouldn't have been able to last long on a decisive attack.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings took up construction, the country was relatively calm and needed protection against only small groups of drifters.
The balance of forces was a system in which European countries sought to preserve the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations must strive to prevent a nation from becoming strong, and national governments often change their alliances to maintain balance.
The first war, whose main issue was the balance of power, was the war on the Spanish heritage.
This marked an important change, since the European forces no longer have the foresight of religious wars.
At the burning of Herostrat on July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at all costs to achieve glory. The outraged Ephesians declared that Herostrat's name would never be included.
The Greek historian Strabo later marks the name, and so we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night Alexander the Great was born.
As king, Alexander offered to bear the cost of restoring the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
While you still hit all the notes correctly, make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible; also try not to make very rude movements with your fingers.

Covering most of today's Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan is the civilization of the Indus Valley, which is a bronze civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
Civilization flourished in the area of the Indus River, where its name came from.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization existed in the pools of the already dried-up Sarasvati River, it must be called the Ind-Sarasaviti civilization, while some call it Harapa's Harapa, the first of its objects to be unearthed in 1920.
The development of medicine is aided by the military character of the Roman Empire.
Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to be used after the battles.
The surgeons knew different sedatives, including morphine from poppy seed extracts and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They have extensive experience in amputations to save gangrene patients, as well as the use of turnickets and artery cells to stop the blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has made tremendous progress in the field of medicine and has formed much of our familiar knowledge today.
Purland Origami is an origami with the restriction that only one fold can be made at a given time, more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help non-exploited skitters or persons with limited motor skills.
Children develop an understanding of race and race stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with a racial minority, which is stereotyped, not doing well in school, after learning about stereotype related to their race, usually do not do well in school.
MySpace currently has 54 million user profiles and is the third popular website used in the United States.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects, which include an opportunity to easily create a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other functions.
You can get easy access to this page by providing only one web address that facilitates the memory and writing for students who would have problems using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be personalized so that you can read easily, and also with much or little color, according to your wish.
Attention deficit syndrome is a neurologic syndrome whose classic determining triad of symptoms involves impulseness, a tendency to distract and hyperactivity or excessive energy.
This is not a difficulty in training, it is a educational disorder; it “is reaching 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million American children,
Children with attention deficit syndrome (ADD) are hard to focus on school work, but can concentrate on things they like to do, play games or write sentences without a point, or watch their favorite animations.
These children tend to get involved in a lot of trouble because they “have risky behavior, go into battle, and look for authority to stimulate their brains, because their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
Attention deficit syndrome affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they are acting like this or why they are spelling this way or that their level of maturity is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn has changed in the above manner, the basic rate of knowledge has also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There is no longer pressure within the individual cancellation, now the focus is on the possibility of canceling the text.
In general, the approach to learning and knowledge dissemination is changing significantly throughout the Renaissance.
Unlike other primates, hominids are already using their hands to carry weights, swing on trees and move.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight of walking with a bone.
The human hand has better phalanges and is shorter than the foot.
Fossil bones of the arm aged two to three million years reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to processing.
Some people believe that the frequent experience of very artificially challenged conscious dreams can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that increase the time between conditions of rapid eye movement (REM).
With less REM at night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers, becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as exhausting as if you wake up every 20 or 30 minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream clearly at night.
In North Africa almost since the beginning, things have not gone well for the Italians. Within a week after the declaration of war from Italy on June 10, 1940, the British 11th hussary regiment conquers Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
The British captured the chief engineer of the Italian tenth army, General Lastucci, in an ambush east of Bardiya.
On 28 June, Marshall Italo Balbo, the governor general of Libya and heir to Mussolini, was killed by a friendly fire in the execution of a dezantium in Tobruk.
The modern sport festival is practiced at many levels - from students to university, to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is mainly practiced in the form of a duel, as one swordsman duels with another.
In the game golf players use sticks to hit the balls against holes.
They play eighteen holes during a regular round, as players usually start from the first hole of the field and end in the eighteenth.
The player who takes the smallest hits or bats with the bat to finish the track wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass across the hole is cut low and is called green.
Probably the most common type of tourism is that connects to travel by most people: recreation tourism.
When people go to a place that's very different from their normal daily lives to relax and have fun, we talk about it.
The beaches, thematic parks and campsites are often the most visited places by tourists for vacation.
If the purpose of the visit is to get to know history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can consider different attractions in the country or choose to focus on only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonizers also called for backup.
The troops, strengthening the front positions, included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 under the command of Colonels James Reed and John Stark (both later became generals).
On the fence at the north end of Colonists' position, the men of Stark took their positions.
When the tide opened a ravine along the Mystic River River River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall in the north, ending up on the edge of the water on a small beach.
Gredley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered that there be no shooting until the civilians crossed.
The US plan envisioned coordinated attacks from three different countries.
General John Kadwolder would launch a relieving attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block possible reinforcements.
General James Ewing will translate 700 troops along the Trenton ferry, take the bridge over Asunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from fleeing.
The main storm squad of 2,400 will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Green's command and one under Sullivan's leadership to launch an attack before a doubt.
By changing the run from a quarter mile to a half mile, the speed becomes much smaller until endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first-class runner at 800 meters, a person who can run the distance in less than two minutes, must have high speed, but endurance must be trained at any cost.
A few cross country runs in the winter combined with gymnastic exercise for the upper body are the best preparations for the refugee season.
Only proper eating practices cannot produce excellent results, but can significantly affect the overall good health of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, they have effective hydration habits and understand the different aspects of the use of supplements, athletes can improve their performance and increase their enjoyment from sport.
There are many wrong notions about the small equipment, which is required to participate in the running of medium distances, which is relatively cheap sport.
If necessary, products may be purchased, but most of them will have little or no real impact on the result.
The athletes may feel that they prefer a certain product even when it does not benefit them in real terms.
The atom can be regarded as one of the main building blocks of all matter.
This is a very complex unit that, according to the simplified model of Bor, consists of a central core and orbiting electrons around it, something similar to the planets around the sun - see Fig. 1.1.
The core consists of two types of particles – protons and neutrons.
The protons have a positive electric charge until the neutrons don't have a positive charge.
Before you check the victim, you need to first check the location and make sure you're safe.
When approaching the victim you need to notice his or her position and any automatic red flags.
If you get hurt while trying to help, you can only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and black eyes mediate the relationship between pain and disability in those suffering from pain in the lower back.
Only the consequences of a disaster, not depression and fear depended on regular weekly PA sessions.
Participants in regular activity needed more support in terms of negative perception of pain, to distinguish chronic pain from the feeling of discomfort in normal physical movement.
The vision or vision ability depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye structures with different complexity according to the requirements of the body.
Different constructions have different properties, are sensitive to different wave lengths and have different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing to make sense of input data as well as different numbers to work optimally.
The collection of organisms of a particular species within a geographical area is a population.
When all individuals in a given population are identical to a particular phenotype, they are defined as monomorphic.
Individuals are polymorphic when demonstrating several options of a particular line.
Ant soldiers' colonies also march and nest in different stages.

What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella, ” meaning “a small room ” and was originally created by a microscopy that observed the structure of the shell.
The main unit of all living beings is the cell, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
The cells are so basic and important to study life that they are often defined as “the building elements of life ”

Switch from one state to another and do not change the elements and compounds.
The nitrogen in a gaseous state still has the same properties as the liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. The composite water consists of two atoms hydrogen and one atom oxygen.
Whether it's gas, liquid or solid, it has the same molecular structure.
Although his physical condition may have a change, the chemical is maintained unchanged.
Time is all around us and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time has been studied by scholars in the field of religion, philosophy and science for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events flowing from the future to the present and then the past.
Time is also how we compare the length of events.
You can record the time you spent watching repetitive events. Cycling is such an event that happens again and again at regular intervals.
In our time computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Complicated animations can be created on computers, and this type of animation is used more and more in television and movies.

For a long period of time in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first settlers of New Zealand were the maoris who were hunting giant birds called moa.
Then the theory came to the idea that the maori migrated from Polynesia with a great fleet and took over New Zealand from the Moriores, establishing an agricultural society.
But new evidence suggests that the Moriores were a group of maoris from the drought, migrating from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
In the islands of Chatham there was another tribe - the Maoris that migrated far from New Zealand.
They were called Moroires, and there were a few grabs and finally the moriors were destroyed.

While listening to people share their personal, family, and organizational stories, we received a valuable understanding of the past and some of the individuals who had a good or bad influence on the culture of the organization.
Understanding history at least helps people to get an idea of where they are in the history of the organization, although it does not imply an understanding of culture.
Individuals and all participants discover deeper values, mission and driving forces of the organization by assessing the successes and awareness of failures.
In this case, what helped people to open up to new changes and new guidelines for the local church was the reminder of previous cases of entrepreneurial behaviour and achievements.
Such examples of success have reduced fears of change, while creating positive tendencies for change in the future.
Convergent thinking patterns are techniques to solve problems that unite diverse ideas or areas to reach a solution.
The speed, logic and accuracy are the focus of this thinking, as well as the discovery of facts, the re-implementation of existing techniques, the gathering of information.
The most important condition for this way of thinking is that only one answer is correct. Thinks of only two answers, namely true or wrong.
This kind of thinking is associated with certain standard procedures or such in science.
People with such thinking have logical thinking, can easily remember models, solve tasks and work on scientific tests.
In reading the thoughts of others, people are far the most talented species.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the perceptions of other people, their intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires.
Understanding others' intentions is crucial among these abilities.

The MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear-magnetic resonance, discovered in 1930 by Felix Block (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
The magnetic field and the radio waves cause atoms to emit miniature radio signals in this resonance.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for the use of magnetic resonance images as a means of medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the world's first one, awarded in the area of the MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first YMR scanner for the entire body, which he called \"Unbreakable\"
