I think we're gonna need more time.
They're meeting at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to change his stomach because he ate something toxic.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
Your green's fine.
I bet you speak French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the seashore.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayam?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand what's important.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French guilt?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on one of the bottoms.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She's convinced her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally I stopped in front of the old house, and I saw the city once more.
You're not gonna see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snoring.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come and help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You can't help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good with everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go again at any time.
I want no tea, I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train passed 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compactdisc.
The director considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible that this is love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountains.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Traveling through southern Germany will see farms with solar panels everywhere to look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the rioters.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average growth.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
Naitina Tom, I don't know him that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's part true.
He's lived here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is associated with national specificities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom threw up blood.
It's Tom's camera.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut him down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Has Mike stopped drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my younger sister leave at the same time?
The sword was delayed for some time.
His brother's learning a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He comes from inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That kabuki book could be sweet.
I'm sorry.
Is this book yours?
I've always wanted to study French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's mean.
What is the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm saving it for the price.
You can speak French, can't you?
My father smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wronged the address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
It doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at noon.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and non-alcoholic beverages.
Tom looks pale.
I hope this helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike's running very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
Do you speak French too?
I started studying French recently, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no bigger than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom's still living with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom has small hands.
He arrived two days early.
Did you have a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom onto the bridge.
If I were you, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was expelled from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
We're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another number of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy talking to Tom.
The twins' brothers look exactly alike.
Don't mess with Tom.
I didn't get the funny part.
I bet you do.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have a right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's party.
You won't be the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily ever after.
I'm angry at myself.
It was done by himself by Tom.
You're not gonna believe the kind of stuff people throw out.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much baggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They work both ways.
Tom's not welcome here.
You accused her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling around, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given the advantage of the others.
I got you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made fun of me in public.
The pear burned down.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut him down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the photo I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French in Tom.
We all took for granted that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I'm not feeling well.
Why early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do what you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I'm thinking of taking a vacation, learning how to swim.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out that easy.
It's almost 5:30.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken skipped the wall.
The top of the mountain is snow-covered.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There's a really good restaurant right next to the beach that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said \"no\" yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
He who sows winds will reap storms.
According to the latest census, the population of the country is a little over 7 million people.
The temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left my keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
Think with your head for once.
I thought you might be hungry.
It's the beginning of a new era.
I have to put on my shoes.
Chat times, that's what I'm thinking.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so get to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her one piece of advice.
The room was so full of smoke, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He sure loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
Is Spot gone, too?
I promise I'll get it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom's wearing a helmet.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we go to the library together?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in effect.
There's a button missing on your shirt.
I have to go out for a while.
You're good at green.
Fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me that watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom teaches French every day.
In this store, they do kitchen equipment.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay until the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Did any of your teams speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen one like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been on top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debates.
Eat one live frog every morning and for all the rest of the day nothing will happen to you any worse.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't wait last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're studying French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should quit.
Please have patience.
Your joke is getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
Everybody's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom still wanted to be single.
I have three kids.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animal, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I had pizza every day last week.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You must be mistaken.
His daughter became a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk. He's writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my checkbook.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in the presence of his father.
Your shoes are loose.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took his coat off.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to have lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone coming in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was alone at home.
In the Esperano, the essentials end up with ‘o’; the multiple number is formed by adding ‘j’
Tom wants to become a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is hard language.
I didn't eat all the food.
You'll stop thinking about her soon enough.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
Still no memory of Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you do everything you wanted to do?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than it is in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I have chestnut hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
There's a little bit of it.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I've got three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom was going through the drawer to see if there was any pen he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom's not gonna believe this.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet with Tom.
We ran out after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I don't feel bad about that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained the details.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you're really gonna like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
Of course, his ignorance.
You're absolutely right.
Everybody knows his name.
My French is no good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll give him a farewell party.
What club are you in?
Atsushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He graduated Cambridge with a medal.
I have to bring her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom study French at school?
What kind of shoes are they?
We've certainly worked hard.
I'm gonna delay my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You don't know half of it.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'm gonna help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Walk away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate anyone's copyright.
Tom's protecting his wife.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Fingers on the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've decided the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How many taxis does a taxi get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiased began his worthy respect for initiative.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
In the beginning, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
Be more specific.
I'm on leave this week.
He's washing his socks.
I promise I'll never do that again.
I just gave blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
You sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his sincerity.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you please tell me your name?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Did you watch the game?
This is your home.
The losses were difficult for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time for them to leave.
She makes up every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make me kind eyes.
I don't have any money.
Milly's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane's out shopping.
That's a nice cake.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long skirts are now demoted.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
It finally snowed and the weather warmed.
She was doing not particularly light hints of what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What are we going to have?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find it.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd love to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just walk around like that, start misusing people's addresses.
I had a 2:30 meeting, but I got stuck in traffic, and I couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom's making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
It's been a waste of time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you \"stupid.\"
I want to speak French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
You sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
You sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His shirt was soaked with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
History is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It's been cleaned.
I can't do that.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
A meeting this afternoon is a better option for me.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What is this?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's share the 50-to-50 reward.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom threw a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I've got a problem.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about the people behind their backs.
She's grown old.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared doesn't care.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
You got a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves silk bugs live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have some news about Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put it on. It hurts.
I've tried everything I know.
Why do people fear her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's recently started recovering.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you give me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend over their diseases.
I wouldn't think the tofu was that delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I'm not past my vertigo yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm nauseous with the gums.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends, and then everyone will finally understand.
She was cold.
Tom's speaking with a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the fair.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you watch closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not being rude.
There's good food in this restaurant.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my spot.
I don't know where he is.
The unemployment is what makes it.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's cute.
Where are you going?
That's a great poem.
The prices have been down lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for handing over the control, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to get Tom to the other side of the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me about that.
I grabbed the cat by the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were once lots of frogs in this pond.
I understand it wonderful.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French over German.
You can read French, can't you?
Fred's often late in an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl's eating bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend is coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope this happens.
Perhaps Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You wish!
I'm afraid I hit you.
I have nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's devoid of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put on those slippers, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll be studying French next semester.

I'll see you tonight.
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.

Children should obey their parents.
Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
Nobody picked up the phone.
I've seen you before.
You're learning Esperanto.
The new bike costs me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Save it until later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so superficial.
I have great news.
It looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel failed because of the earthquake the other day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What have you been doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Shut the damn door!
We made fun of him for that.
John came in a week ago.
He refused the proposal, so did I.

Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.

We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here.
Tom used to sing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not being rude.
I'm an ordinary office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the Kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be there in time.
He often walks to school.
The stockings stink.

It's pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're hot.
How many Van Pierce episodes have you watched?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let go of me.
You're both sweet and sweet.
My sister lives next to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
That wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a minute.
She loves the color of her T-shirt.
Hey, man, I'm asking you-- stick some insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
Your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after, it started to rain.
I have to get back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permits.

I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation's over, he says good-bye and wishes me a good night.
Let's check it out.
So far you've done a good job.
I cooked dinner last night.

As far as I know, he must have been born in Italy.
\"But really- - Yeah, really-
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I have to meet Tom.
Although sometimes Tom's English looks pretty good, he has no idea how far his options go, and it's impossible to convince him he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I saw a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you and Tom fighting.
Will you respond?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is a man's best friend.
It's not working.
My mother made a very cute sex.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in any community service?
Do you care?
Apparently, Tom was already known before he released this album.
The Romans would have no chance of conquering the world if they had first been required to learn Latin.

That's what you've always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clean the table now!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.

In this town, they've been getting iron for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have a fever.
Has anyone told you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do this.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of man would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting, her back was washed in the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me back.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good on you.
I've studied French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please leave.

See if you've turned off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about this life of yours.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor's slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that to your parents.
Let's face it.
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This is a ridiculous situation.
This land belongs to Tom.
I think you should meet with Tom.
Do not add annotations.
He's not here yet.

A lot of my friends can speak French.
He plays guitar well.
Have you played Mykraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medication right now?

I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were just trying to drive.
Can I take your coat?
My father will make me a delicious feast tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut the phone down.
You ready?
I'm not gonna believe this until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept shooting.
Less and less teenagers are working today.
Why am I still hearing this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very beautiful, but it's been readable.

Is your wife a blonde, or is she a brunette?
I'm out driving my bike.
The men carried the boy to the hospital.
They spoke too quickly to find out what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera that Tom took the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you mind putting the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We took a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't want to chew.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain it to you.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
In the spring, days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father singing in the bathroom.
Singapore speaks English.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
She was right.
He was tired and still went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are tired already.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We were playing to win.
What's in the coffee?
The pear is on fire.
I need to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.

I didn't get it.
Give me a hammer.

He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you get them or you get you!
I hope it's not too late.

I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hood next to the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a bit of a celebrity.
I love pizza so much.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as fun as the book.
The job wasn't dragging me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is a part of all of us called the universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our nearest people. Our task must be to get rid of this prison, extending the circle of our compassion, so as to embrace all living beings and nature throughout and beauty.
He will no doubt come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.

Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.

She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you for being stupid.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that makes me nervous.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Is Tom living far from here?
Bad weather didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
I've got hair on my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and take a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to know when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate that for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you will feel much better.
Are you done with breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom wondered where she spent her childhood, Mary.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took out their guns.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.

You'd better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk in French.
I'd like a shirt that fits that jacket.

You always complain.
The milk is soaked.
Second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'm gonna stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your connection to him?
The Devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother said he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was, I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have a few phone calls to make.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one home, and I was abandoned all day.

Put on your robe.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
Yesterday became a terrible accident.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste any time.

It'll probably snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.

Sooner or later, his luck will end.
It looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Ann doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really that hard to speak French?

Look closely at the map on the wall.

I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I've lost my shape.
Get me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.

Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand what's important.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.

I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slower, please.
“Where you live, ” “I live in Tokyo,
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
The effort is not only necessary but also a pleasure.
We have to be careful.
It's 11 now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You have to use deodorant.
When I'm standing up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not gonna do this.
You don't seem too surprised.
That's a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get a sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing speaking French whenever possible.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People are generally against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom's never met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This is never gonna end.
Tom taught me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they got something.
I could make you happy.
Who's your tooth ache?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We study French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than listening, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You're not gonna believe how popular Tom's become.
Did you do it?
My dad often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't known a thing since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to deal with this now.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
Everybody's hungry.
She's down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you have not paid for your lack of experience, please send the amount due and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like toilets in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're on your own.
The question is being considered.
Tom was rescued by a random passerby.
The town hall is downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm awfully hungry.
That's very kind of you to step out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of town Mary lives in.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.

I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French and what's left to say.
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the girl's best friends.
When he was young, his parents died, so he was raised by his uncle.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything out.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arrangements.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth or you'll regret it later.

Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a private beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it works.
You're all fools.
They're exchanging gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Khytt's Japanese food began to like it.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You should point to that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom teaches me how to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to get a receipt.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know any of them. I don't know any other guy.
The guests should be arriving soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was very nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the ladder.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruit rots under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the control station.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take some time.
I thought you might turn away.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Look out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happy.
He's only four minutes away from here by train.
What's Tom trying to do?
Can anyone trust you?
It's kind of smooth.
I think we better get going.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, come on, keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I've studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's foggy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after being away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we're interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice Mary's age.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I screwed you.
Tom found out that Mary was stealing money from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Is that how stupid you think I am?
If you give somebody $20 and you never see it again, it probably was worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make that decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You're sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
You're French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What does Ken eat?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we're going to go to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I've made a check account.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of sentences for DNA, but there isn't one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind blew on the tides.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the twenty students, only one has read the book.
I have work to do on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it on my own time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What kind of situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you used to date before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted a clown.
In her presence, I find it awkward.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television or radio in those days.
She went to the museum with a taxi.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't you ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She realized her knees were shaking.
Edison invented an electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him another time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't have.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My veins bleed every time I use a tooth thread.
We got here fast because the movement wasn't loaded.
You have to be careful.
What do you miss?
He's recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses are good for you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the catch is over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom's not helping us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't suit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
How long has Tom been studying French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Ugursky sentences in Tataba!
Tom's persistent.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed of what I did.
Let's cut over here.
I know this is hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care for the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected by these people.
I think you'll have a good time tonight.
Don't pick him up yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
That he's too generous is his greatest flaw.
Press Shift button.
You understand, right?
Jane always acted like he was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are washed without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and release this letter in the meantime.
This chicken hasn't laid a single egg in a while.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind that I visited her unexpectedly.
You've got nice lips.
A lot of people are gonna lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He came to me for help.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's over.
The moment of glory for Hanshin didn't last long, they were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Wouldn't that lead to trouble?
He was so upset that he was called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
You really want to do this?
Is he going to fail the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they come up with?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I've got to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the kitchen window to get cold.
Happy is that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, that's too bad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The line divides the Earth into two wheels.
It was personal.
Doesn't he interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to take a break.
When did you start learning French?
She was cleaning her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them out?
How does Tom plan to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I've never spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the photo of my new house.
I want to sleep.
That's Tom's camera, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Move that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We need to protect our children.
Until we meet again.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Budstrasse and get down to Zeestrasse.
Laughter is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everybody told me about.
Add this site to Preferred -
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs cast a great shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I won't give up on the threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickler?
I hope that's helpful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's fine.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to file the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you had told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't take my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom would cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water on, let alone burn a turkey.
What is the name of this river?
Is she available to you tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the road is covered in ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French as a Frenchman.
I think we should agree.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little carried away while I was dancing, and I got up on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit at the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking the wrong way.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is on you.
She took her exam.
I'm studying at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes in my exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where have you been?
I have to get him out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already a grown man.
Let's not kid ourselves.
I've been getting better.
It's not an art, it's a tooth vagina.
I never saw you.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so reacting.
Have you heard of him?
She washed her shirt real quick.
Anybody with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and Alice went out Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape driving a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's take a break under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just stick your fingers in.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep country.
I'm sorry.
I don't need ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read French lyrics?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid for the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She became twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That's a good part.
Merry Christmas!
Come on down.
Mary's finding out.
They yearn for the city's life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was running around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in here with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom turned himself in too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discussing it.
Eat sushi.
Throw away those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was in a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say such things.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is completely furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking my day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this assignment?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me that before.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work as a bee.
Brian made Kate wait.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom hardly understands anything from French.
It's the same hospital Tom works at.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is spending a lot of electricity.
Don't get attached to this hunt propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be canceled.
First the good God made the man and then made the woman. Then, he had pity on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Oh, he's dancing.
Today machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please, start right now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's having a hard time.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
\"People's nonsense is infinite, I say, and because of this self-criticism, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter in French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would have wanted?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back to the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't hide how that makes you feel.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It's gonna be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't get in the lock.

I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find Tom's fault.
She put on a sweater.
Sometimes my money ends.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so many bad gums, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try the dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a rock.
Where were you born?
Those clothes look good on you.
They're heading straight for their target.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
It pays off all the time.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't push me.
I think you should grow a beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another non-alcoholic?
A lot of people share my vision on this.
The blouse's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big work at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
A child is not a vessel to be filled with, but a fire to be lit.

I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom, start the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
You boil 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike's better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money buys no happiness.
We're guys.
Bad weather has prevented us from leaving.
I'm learning French now.
Since I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm awfully busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're in the winning series.
I can't get mad at you about that.
The distribution of television has greatly deprived us of our reading time.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't look in my closet.
The new coronavirus is highly contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm off the record here.
Don't look directly at Tom.

I didn't understand the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?

He's at the door.
My business is back on track.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police disaster.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about an increase right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you scared?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks medium-sized coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just received word from Kansas concerning your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?

Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
It's not as bad as laziness.

God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
Sometimes he watches TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to speak to you soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so hard.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.

We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself never to do it again.
