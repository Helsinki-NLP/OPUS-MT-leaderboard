Protesters said that around 100,000 responded in German cities such as Berlin, Keln, Hamburg and Hanover.
The Berlin police estimated 6,500 protesters attended the protests.
The protests were also held in Paris, Sofia, Bulgaria, Villanus, Lithuania, Valetti, Malta, Tallinn, Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland.
In London, about 200 people demonstrated in front of the offices of some of the main copyright owners.
Last month, mass protests were held in Poland when the state signed ACTA, which is why the Poland government decided not to ratify the agreement so far.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the ACTA accession process.
The Front for animal liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Civility to Animals, RSPCA again call for mandatory installation of video surveillance in all slaughterhouses in Australia.
RSPCA Chief Inspector from New South Wales David O'Shannessy told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses in Australia should be a common phenomenon.
\"The video surveillance system will certainly send a strong signal to people working with animals that animal welfare is the highest priority –
The international earthquake map of the American Geological Institute has not shown earthquakes in Iceland a week earlier.
The Icelandic Weather Office has also reported that there has been no seismic activity in the area of Hekle in the last 48 hours.
Significant earthquake activity resulting in a phase change occurred on March 10th on the northeast side of the Kaldera volcano summit.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were recorded at the foot of the mountain.
Because of the clouds, there was an opportunity to express uncertainty about whether there was any eruption at all.
The moon had 120-160 cubic metres of fuel when it broke down and when the strong winds and waves pushed it onto the port bank.
The choppers rescued twelve crew members, and the only damage was in the form of a broken nose.
A ship 100 meters long went to take the usual load of manure, and officials initially feared that the cargo could be spilled from the ship.
The proposed amendment has already adopted both homes in 2011.
The amendment occurred at this legislative session, when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives, and then adopted by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
Failure to adopt a second sentence, proposing a ban on the same-sex civil communities, could open doors for civil communities in the future.
After this procedure, the next elected legislation in 2015 or 2016 will review HJR-3 in order to remain in the process.
Vautier's out-of-directive achievements include a hunger strike that was subjected to in 1973 in protest against what he considered political censorship.

He was also previously charged with copyright violations, but the indictment was not filed.
A former student said that he used slang in class, taught the skills of dating, and was like a friend to his students.
In the past three decades, although officially remaining a communist country, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, the Chinese economy has grown 90 times.
Last year China had for the first time more car exports than Germany and the US came out as the largest market in this industry.
Chinese GDP could exceed the US within two decades.
The tropical storm, Danielle, the fourth storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, was named in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, observed about 3,000 miles from Miami, the federal state of Florida, has a maximum lasting wind of 40 m/h (64 km/h).
The National Hurricane Centre predicts that Danielle will be on to the hurricane by Wednesday.
Given that the storm is far from land, it remains difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek became famous while playing for Belgrade's Partizan.
He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
During his team time, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one else had more performances or scored more goals for a club than Bobek.
He was named the best player in Partizan history in 1995.
The celebration began with a special performance performed by the world-famous Cirque du Soleil.
He was followed by Istanbul's Symphony Orchestra, the lamb band and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.

In terms of the global financial situation, Zapatero continued to say \"the financial system is part of the economy, or its crucial part.\"
We are in a financial crisis that has been going on for a year and has shown its sharpest moment in the past two months, but I think financial markets are now beginning to recover.
Naked News announced last week that it would dramatically increase international news reporting in foreign languages, with three new languages.
A global organization that already reports in English and Japanese, launches television, web, and mobile devices in Spanish, Italian and Korean.
\" Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a creepy sight of people trying to break the windows to get out.
People used to hit the window frames with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the windows finally broke and started coming out of the window, ” said Franciszek Kowal.
The stars send out light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms are combined to form more difficult elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
This is, however, a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before useful fusion reactors are built.
Because of the surface voltage, the steel needle floats on the water.
The tension on the surface occurs because the molecules of water on its surface attract each other much more powerful than they are attracted to the air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible cover on the surface of water that allows things like a needle to float on water.
The blade on the modern slider has a double edge with a conical cavity between the edges. The two edges allow better ice-drying, even when leaned to the side.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly covered, when the blade leans on one side or the other side, the edge that is in contact with the ice is curved.
This causes the slider to turn. If the sliders lean to the right, the slider will turn to the right, and if the sliders lean to the left, the scroll will turn to the left.
To return to the previous level of energy, they must get rid of the excess energy they received from the light.
They do this by broadcasting a tiny particle of light called \"foton\"
Scientists call this process “stimulated emissions of radiation – because bright light stimulates atoms, causing photons of light to emissions, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are in reality much smaller than those shown in the image.
Photons are even smaller than the elements that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, the lamp fiber eventually burns out and the bulb doesn't work anymore.
Then the bulb should be replaced with caution when replacing the light bulb.
The first thing to do is turn off the light-body switch or unplug the cable.
This is because the current that comes to the socket on which the metal part of the bulb is placed can cause a strong electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while the bulb is partly still in the socket.
The main organ of the circulation system is the heart that pumps blood.
Blood comes out of the heart through tubes called arteries and returns to the heart through tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of the triceratops could have crushed not only leaves, but even very solid branches and roots.
Some scientists think that triceratops ate cicadas, a kind of plant common to the chalk age.
These plants look like little palm trees with a crown of sharp, pointy leaves.
Triceratops could use his strong beak to remove leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly toxic and are unlikely to have been consumed by any dinosaur, although sloths and other animals such as parrots (strange of dinosaurs) today can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you were standing on the surface of Io, you'd have less weight than on Earth.
The person who weighs 200 pounds on Earth (90kg) on Io would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg). Of course, gravity attracts you less.
The sun has no crust like the Earth you can stand on. The entire sun is made of gases, fire and plasma.
The more you get away from the center of the sun, the less the gas gets.
The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called a photosphere, which means “a light ball, ”
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo observed with a telescope that Venus, like the Moon, had changes.
The changes appear because only the side of Venus (or the moon) that is facing the sun is lit. Venus's changes supported Kopernik's theory that the planets are moving around the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks spotted Venus crossing.
England went through a period of peace that lasted long after Danelaw was won again.
In 991, however, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet greater than any other since Gutruma a century earlier.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the goal of freeing his country from Danish domination.
After initial military interference, Ethel agreed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to take over his kingdom, although with incomplete success.
Hangeul is the only deliberately designed alphabet that is in everyday use. This alphabet was designed in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and one of the kings to enjoy the greatest respect.
The Hangeul alphabet originally called the Hunmin Yeongeum, meaning “proper sounds as an instruction to the people –
There are many theories about the formation of Sanskrit, one of which relates to the migration of the Aryans to the west of India that brought their own language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to a Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest famous book in the world was written on Sanskrit. After the writings of Upanishada were collected, Sanskrit disappeared because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has served as a basis for many modern Indian languages, just like the Latin basics of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France, Germany began preparing for an attack on the British island.
Germany gave the attack the code name “A Sea Lion Operation, a large part of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army were lost during the evacuation of Dunkirk, and the army was quite weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (‘Kriegsmarine’) and was able to destroy any invasion fleet sent through the English channel.
However, a very small number of Royal Navy ships were located near the probable routes of attack because the admirals feared that a German air strike would sink them.
Italy was mostly the younger brother of Germany and Japan.
She had a weaker army and a navy, despite the fact that she had made four new ships just before the war started.
In order to take over these countries, Italy's main objectives were to have a point to send troops to be able to sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
That's why they were forced to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and in addition, Italian warships were not supposed to have any other mission.
Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
The submarines are ships designed to sail underwater and remain there for a longer period of time.
The submarines were used in World War I and then they were extremely slow and they had quite a limited range of shootings.
At the beginning of the war, mostly they were moving on the surface of the sea, but as the radar began to develop and become more precise, the submarines had to go underwater in order not to be detected.
German submarines were called U-boats, and the Germans were very good at navigation and using their submarines.
Because of their success with the submarines, after the war the Germans are not trusted enough to be allowed to have many.
Yes! King Tutankamon, sometimes called the king Tut - or - the boy - king, is one of the ancient Egyptian kings, the most famous in modern times.
Interestingly, in ancient times he was not considered a very important figure and was not recorded on most of the lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922, made him famous, although many tombs in the past were robbed, the tomb was left almost intact.
Most of the items buried with Tutancamon are well preserved, including thousands of objects made of precious metals and rare stones.
Finding the point with the frogs has made the Assyrian chariot easier, faster and more ready to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers about 1,000 BC, the Assyrians presented the first cavalry.
The horse is an army that fights on horses. The saddle was not yet made up, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of a horse.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous person who comes from this culture is Homer, a legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature – the epics of Iliad and Odysseus.
Sofokle and Aristophan are still popular dramatists, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician of Pythagoras, too famous for the famous theorem of relations between the sides of the right triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindu language. It is estimated that the number of speakers between second and fourth languages in the world is estimated to be.
The number of original speakers changes depending on whether very closely connected dialects are calculated.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu languages are similar to vocabulary, but letters differ; in everyday conversation speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
In the 15th century, northern Estonia was under Germany's great cultural influence.
Several German monks wanted to draw God closer to the indigenous people and thus invented Estonian literature.
It was based on the German alphabet, and the letter “.”
In time, many words that were borrowed from German were raised, and this was the beginning of enlightenment.
The heir to the throne, according to tradition, would go straight to the army immediately after the school was completed.
However, Charles attended the University of Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and archaeology, and later history, and gained a degree that reflects good success in the study.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a diploma.
The European part of Turkey (East Traki or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) is 3% of the country's waste.
Turkey's debt territory is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and 800 km (500 miles), a rough rectangle.
The area of Turkey, including the lakes, occupies 783.562 square kilometers (300.948 sqm), of which 755.688 square kilometers (291.773 sqm) is located in southwestern Asia and 23.764 square kilometers (9.174 sqm) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and its surface is sized as continental France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey is surrounded by three seas: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg is a country with a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium have been part of Luxembourg in the past, but after the Belgian Revolution that took place in the 1830s, they became part of Belgium.
Luxembourg has always sought to remain a neutral country, but Germany occupied it both in World War II and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the founder of the organization today known as the European Union.
Drugyal Dzong is a collapsed fortress and Buddhist monastery located in the north district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
In 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was believed to have built a fortress in honour of his victory against Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
Because of the fire that happened in 1951, in the fortress of Drukgyal Dzong only some relics remained, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fortress was preserved and protected after the fire and remained one of Bhutan's most exciting attractions.
During the 18th century Cambodia was pressed by two strong neighbours - Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais launched several attacks on Cambodia and destroyed Pnom Phen in 1772.
In the last 18th century, the Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most employees work in the grey economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelan employees work in the service sector, almost a quarter works in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, as the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of the population is employed in the oil industry.

Learning how to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools that have been learned in interactive settings (doing stories, editing audio and video recordings, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design asks you to reconsider the assumptions about media production and learn to think in unconventional ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of the project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate unit.
A lack of lens to increase the display is that the focus complexity and number of objective elements are needed to achieve a range of focus lengths far greater than that of the main lenses.
This is becoming a minor problem as manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of lenses.
This enabled zoomed-in lenses to capture quality photos comparable to those that achieve a fixed wireless distance lens.
Another lack of zoom-in lens is that the maximum temperature (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
Therefore, it is difficult to use cheap lenses to increase the display in light-free conditions.
One of the most common problems with DVD-format conversion is overriding (overlapping).
Most television content is designed to please the general public.
Because of that, everything you see on TV has boundaries, tops, bottoms and sides.
This was designed to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called the border area of the screen.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, and its boundaries will be cut, and if the video record has titles that are near the bottom part, it won't be fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castle has long been an inspiration for imagination and has mastered paintings of knights' tournaments, banquets and knighthoods of King Arthur.
Even if you're standing in the middle of a thousand years of ruins, it's easy to summon the sounds and smells of a long time ago struggle, you can almost hear the hooves pounding on the caldres and feel the fear of the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were the castles built at all?
Kirby Muxloe Castle, typical of that period, looks more like a fortified house than a real castle.
His big glass windows and thin walls couldn't resist a strong attack for long.
During the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build, the country was relatively peaceful and needed to defend it only from small gangs of wandering robbers.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept meant that all European nations must seek to prevent a nation from becoming powerful, so government governments have often changed alliances to maintain balance.
The war for the Spanish heritage was the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This was an important change, because European forces no longer had reason to wage war on account of religious wars, which means that the Thirty Years ’ War was the last war that was waged as a religious war.
The temple of Artemide in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21st, 356 B.C.E. in the fire that planted Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was to become known at all costs. The bitter Ephesians announced that the name Herostratus would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later stated that name, by which we know him today. The temple was destroyed the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander as king offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was rejected. After that, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt 323 B.C.E.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as you press all notes correctly. Also, try not to make a lot of unnecessary finger movements.
Remember, there's no need to hit the keys hard to make the sound stronger than the piano.
For a stronger sound on the harmonica, use a harmonica with higher pressure or speed.
Mysticism is a quest for unity, identity, or clear awareness of the extreme reality, deity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/godliness or deity.
Followers shall follow certain lifestyles or practices that are intended to preserve these experiences.
Mystique may differ from other forms of religious belief and respect for its emphasis on the direct personal experience of the unique state of mind, especially these peaceful, insightful, blissful or even exotic characters.
Sikism is a religion that comes from the Indian sub-continent. It was created in the Panjab region during the 15th century, after a sectarian rift with Hindu tradition.
Sikhs believe that their faith is a separate religion from Hinduism, although they recognize their Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is the Panjap word for “the road of guru, ” the guru is the basic aspect of all religions in India, but in Sikism he took meaning that makes up Sikh’s beliefs.
The religion was founded by Guru Nanak (1469 -39) in the 15th century, and nine gurus were subsequently formed.
However, in June 1956, Khrushč's promises were tested when riots in Poland, where workers protested food shortages and wage cuts, turned into general protests against communism.
Although Krushchev eventually sent tanks to seduce order, he agreed to some economic demands and agreed to appoint popular Wladislav Gomulka as the new prime minister.
Civilization of the Indus Valley was a bronze age civilization in the northwest of the Indian sub-continent, which encompassed most of today's Pakistan and some region in the northwest of India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Basin of the Indus River, where her name came from.
Although some scholars speculate that civilization existed in the water of the now dried-up Saraswati River, it would be appropriate to call it indo-sarasative civilization, while some call it the Arab civilization of Harapa, its first location excavated in the 1920s.
The militant nature of the Roman Empire has contributed to the development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to be used after battle.
The surgeons knew different sedatives, including morphine from poppy extract and scopolamine from the well's seeds.
To save patients from gangrene, they gained experience in amputation, as well as with bindings and artery clamps to stop blood flow.
Over several centuries, the Roman Empire has made great progress in the field of medicine and has formed a great deal of knowledge that we today possess.
Pureland Origami is an origami that restricts a paper that can only be folded at the same time, a more complex fold such as reverse coatings are not allowed, and any folding move must be equal.
It was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to help the inexperienced puzzlers or those with limited mobility.
Children develop early consciousness about race and racial stereotypes that affect their behavior.
For example, children who relate to a racial minority for whom there is a stereotype that is not successful at school tend to fail at school once they know about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects of these web sites that mean easy setting up a class site that can include blogs, videos, photos and other functions.
This site can be easily accessed by specifying only one web address, making it easier to remember and type for students who have difficulty using keyboards or spelling.
It can be adjusted so that it is easy to read and the desired amount of color can be added.
Attention deficit disorder “represents neurological syndrome whose classic definition triad symptoms include impulsiveness, easy distractions and hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a difficulty in learning, but a learning disorder, which “hits 3 to 5 percent of all children, and possibly even 2 million American children. ”
Children with attention disorders find it hard to focus on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy, such as playing games or watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a variety of trouble because they “riskly behave, get into fights and challenge authority, to stimulate the brain, since their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
Attention disorder affects peer relationships because other children cannot understand why they behave like this or why they write in a way that they write or that their degree of maturity is different.
Since the ability to adopt knowledge and learning has changed in the above mentioned way, the basic level of knowledge has changed.
Access to obtaining information was different. There was no longer pressure inside individual memories, but focus was the ability to remember text.
In essence, the Renaissance has introduced significant changes in the approach to learning and sharing knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use their hands to move, carry their own weight or swing on trees.
The palm and foot of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of palms to carry weight when walking on joints.
A human hand is shorter than a foot and has flatter fingers.
Fossil bones between two and three million years old reveal this change in the form of the perfecting of the hand from the locomotive to manipulation.
Some people believe that many artificially challenged Lucid dreams can often be exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is as a result of the lucid substances extending the time between the REM phase.
With less REM in the course of the night, this condition in which you experience real sleep and your body rests, becomes so rare that it leads to problems.
It's just as tiresome as if every twenty or thirty minutes you'd wake up and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucidly during the night.
The Italians in North Africa did not do well. Within a week of the Italian announcement of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussar regiment took over the Capuzzo fortress in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardija, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian Ten Forces, General Lastucci.
Marshall Italo Balbo, Libya's general governor and apparent Mussolini's successor, was killed on June 28th by a friendly fire as he landed in Tobruk.
Modern torture is practiced at many levels, from students who teach it in the university to professional and Olympic competitions.
Sport is primarily played in the format of a duel, one swordsman in a duel with another.
Golf is a game where players use sticks to hit balls and hit holes.
In a standard round there are eighteen holes, when players usually start at the first hole in the field and end on the eighteenth.
Wins a player who takes the slightest punch or swings with a bat to cross the field.
It is played on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short and called green grass.
Probably the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel - recreational tourism.
It's when people go to a place that differs greatly from their daily lives to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camps are often the most common places for a recreational visit to tourists.
If the goal of the visit is to meet its history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights in a particular country or can simply decide to focus on only one area.
The colonists, seeing that activity, also called for reinforcements.
The troops that strengthened the attack positions included the 1st and 3rd Colonel from New Hampshire, which consisted of 200 people, under the leadership of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men have taken positions along the fence at the north end of the colonist position.
When the tide caused a crack along the Mystic River, northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall in the direction of the north ending on a small beach.
Gredley or Stark have placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered not to fire until those who regularly pass through there.
The American plan has relied on the launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a diversion attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any additional reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militias across the river in Trent Ferry, seized a bridge over the Assunpink River and prevented enemy troops from fleeing.
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups – one under Green's command, and the other under Sullivan's command, with the aim of starting before dawn.
Moving from running to a quarter mile to running half a mile, speed becomes much less important, and endurance becomes an absolute need.
Of course, a top-notch semi-marathon, a man who can break a two-minute record must have a good speed, but at any rate he must maintain stamina.
The best preparation for the running season is running all over the country during the winter and training the upper part of the body in gyms.
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot lead to elite achievements, but can have a significant impact on the general health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits and understanding of different aspects of practice relating to the use of complementarys can help athletes improve the results and increase the enjoyment of sport.
Running at the middle distance is relatively cheap sport. However, there are many delusions about several pieces of equipment that are needed for participation.
Products can be bought in accordance with the need, but most will have a weak or no effect on performance.
Sportsmen can feel that they like the product, even when it has no real benefits.
Atom can be considered one of the basic components of all matter.
This is a very complex whole that, according to the simplified Bor model, consists of the central core surrounding the electric ones -- something similar to the planets orbiting the sun -- to see Figure 1.1.
The core consists of two particles -- neutron and proton.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, and neutrons don't have a charge.
First, you need to look at the place to ensure your safety before you check the victim.
You will notice the position of the victim as you approach her, as well as all automatic warnings.
If you hurt yourself while trying to help yourself, maybe you'll just make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and thinking about the disaster between pain and disability in people suffering from pain in the lower back.
Only the effects of disaster, not depression and fear, were conditions for regular weekly sessions of physical activity.
Participants in regular activities demanded greater support in terms of negative perception of pain, and they separated the differences between feelings of chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical movement.
The vision or visual ability depends on the sensory organs of the visible system or eyes.
There are many different structures of the eyes, with a range of complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different options, are sensitive to different wavelengths and varying degrees of sharpness, and also require different treatments to understand the input and different numbers in order to work optimally.
The population is a group of organisms belonging to a particular species within a geographical area.
When all individual members of the population are identical in terms of certain phenotypic properties, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals show several forms of one feature, they are polymorphic.
Army ant colonies are also marching and nesting in different stages.
In the nomadic stage, the army ants march at night, and in the daytime they camp and rest.
The colonization begins at a nomadic stage when the amount of available food is reduced. During this phase the colonies serve as a temporary nest that changes daily.
Each one of these nomadic ravings or marches takes about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word “cell ” comes from the Latin word“ cell ” meaning “little room ” and was used for the first time by a microscopicist while observing the structure of the cork.
A cell is the basic unit of living beings and all the organisms make one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and essential to studying life that we basically call them \"grade blocks of life\"
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to perform blood flow undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body that it helps to save the body from potential threats.
The tornado hits a small area compared to other powerful storms, but it can destroy anything in its path.

Many dream of a day when people will be able to travel to other stars and explore other worlds, and some wonder what exists out there, and some believe that aliens or other forms of life can live on another planet.
But if that ever happens, it probably won't happen anytime soon.
Maybe one day, your great-great-grandchildren will stand on top of the alien world and think about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of a bunch of cells, eat food and digest it, most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (although they don’t even have all the animals. For example, jellyfish have no brain).
The animals are all over the earth, they dig the earth, they swim in the oceans and they fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The cell word is derived from the Latin word cell, which means a small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you'll find that they're made of squares or a ball.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in the cork by means of a microscope.
He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can be converted from one state to another without changing.
Soul as gas has the same properties as liquid nitrogen, liquid conditions are thicker, but molecules are still the same.
The water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it's in a gas, liquid or solid state.
Although his physical condition may change, his chemical condition remains the same.
Time is all around us and it affects everything we do, but still it's hard to understand.
Religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that pass through the present from the future into the past.
Time also includes how we compare the duration (longness) of the event.
You can mark the passing of time by observing the recurrence of a cyclic event. A cyclic event is something that happens and repeats regularly.
Computers are used today to manipulate photos and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be done on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and in movies.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the early inhabitants of New Zealand were believed to be Maoris who were hunting giant birds called Moe.
Based on this theory, the idea was that the Maori migrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and took away New Zealand from the Moriories, and that this was how they founded the agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Morios were a group of Maors from the interior who migrated from New Zealand to Chatham Islands and built their characteristic, peaceful culture.
In the islands of Chatham there lived another tribe, and these were the Maoris who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Morios, there were a few riots, and in the end, the Moriores were gone.
Individuals who have been involved for decades have helped us appreciate our advantages and passions and to honestly assess difficulties, even failures.
Listening to individuals share personal, family, and organizational stories, we have received valuable insight into the past and some of the individuals who have had a good or bad influence on the culture of the organization.
Although understanding one's history does not imply understanding of culture, at least it helps people to get a sense of where they belong in the history of the organization.
By assessing the success and becoming aware of the failures, individuals and individuals who have been involved as a whole have a deeper discovery of the values, task and driving forces of the organisation.
In this case, a reminder of previous examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and success associated with this behaviour helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories have reduced the fear of change and have also established positive tendencies towards change in the future.
Convergent patterns of thought are techniques to solve problems that combine different ideas or areas in order to find solutions.
The focus of this way of thinking is the speed, logic and precision, as well as the detection of facts, the re-use of existing techniques, the gathering of information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one accurate answer. You mean only two answers – the one that is true and the one that is false.
This way of thinking is linked to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People who think this way, think logically and can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
People are far the most talented species in the matter of reading other people's thoughts.
This means that we are able to successfully predict what others perceive, intend, believe, know, or wish.
Within these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is essential, allowing us to resolve the possible ambiguities of physical activities.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you would probably assume he's trying to steal someone else's car.
He should be tried differently if he lost his car keys and was trying to break into his car.
The MRI is based on a physics phenomenon known as the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (from Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and the radio waves make atoms transmit tiny radio signals.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and scientist, discovered the basis for using a magnetic resonance film as an instrument to establish a medical diagnosis in 1970.
Four years later, a patent was approved, which was the world's first patent issued in the MRI field.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner for the entire body, which he called \"Indestructible\"
Asyncrona communication stimulates thinking and reacting to others.

Using the Internet and the World Wide Web allows students to access information at any time.
Students can ask questions to lecturers at any time of the day and expect quick answers, rather than waiting until the next personal meeting.
Postmodern learning enables freedom from absoluteism. There is not only one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not only one good thing to learn. Learning is based on the experience between students and the knowledge presented.
This point illustrates our current experience with all the tasks for independent work, presented information and learning-based television.
Many of us watch TV shows that inform us about the process or experience we will never participate in or apply that knowledge.
We'll never serve a car, build a fountain in the yard, travel to Peru to examine the ancient ruins or renovate the neighbor's house.
Thanks to the submarine cable with optical fibers in Europe and broadband satellite connections, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the internet.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, surrounded by the South Pole.
Tourist visits are very expensive, require physical preparation, can only be organised during the summer, from November to February, and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Rosso Sea.
Several thousand members of staff here in the summer live in forty bases, mainly in those areas; a small number remains to stay during the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is an abandoned canvas covered in ice for two or three miles.
There are occasional special airline tours going inland for mountain climbing or reaching Paul, where there's a large base.
The South Pole Traverza means a distance of 1,600 miles from McMurd's station on the Ross Sea to Paul.
It's a compressed snow and cracks that are filled with flags. Only specialised tractors that drag fuel and supply sledges can travel to this area.
They're not very skillful, so the track has to make long turns around the Trans-Antarctic Mountains to reach the highlands.
The most common cause of accidents that come in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks, especially stairs.
At least you need shoes with suitable soles of shoes. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, and even some winter boots are insufficient.
The sample should be deep enough, 5 mm or more, and the material should be soft enough at low temperatures.
Some boots have nails and there is equipment that can be added for slippery conditions, which corresponds to most shoes and boots, for fifth or fifth and sole.
Pete needs to be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is mostly landed on roads or roads to improve friction.
Lavine are not abnormal; steep slopes can only retain a certain amount of snow, and excess will fall in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow is sticky so it needs to shake it to sleep and if a little snow falls it can take the rest behind it.
Sometimes the initial cause of the sun that warms the snow, sometimes additional snowfall, and sometimes other natural events, often people.
The tornado is a pillar of very low air pressure that turns and draws the surrounding air in and lifts it upwards.
They cause strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) that can lift heavy objects into the air and carry them along the path of the tornado moving.
They begin as a lefty coming down from the stormy clouds and becoming “Tornade ” when they touch the ground.
VPN service providers (virtuel private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltering.
They are superior to the web proxy for several reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just http
They usually offer greater frequency bandwidth and better service quality. They are encrypted and are therefore harder to spy on.
Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of this practice and claim to serve as “the prevention of piracy – ”
In fact, regional codes absolutely have no effect on illegal copying; a copy of the disk bit-to-be will reproduce normally on any device where it can be done with the original.

You often have to buy a global number that allows PSTN phones to call you. There are differences for people who call you depending on where the number is.
Real-time translation applications - applications that can automatically translate entire passages from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate the text on foreign languages on characters or other objects in the real world when the user directs a smart phone to these objects.
The translation machines have improved dramatically and are now often giving less or more correct translations (and increasingly less foolish), but should still be on caution, since they still make a complete mistake.
One of the most famous applications in this category is Google Translation, which allows you to translate out of network after you download the desired language data.
The GPS navigation application on your smartphone can be the simplest and most convenient way to navigate when you are out of your country.

Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, get a sense of perspective and adopt new skills.
This could also be a good way to better exploit budgets to allow longer stay, as many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and food, and some pay small wages.
Vikings have used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these roads can still be used. Make sure you need special permits that may be difficult to get.
The Belomorian-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea across Lakes One, Lakes Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mainly across rivers and lakes.
The Lake One is also connected to the Volga and it is still possible to reach Russia via the Caspian lake.

If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited by a small number of overseas routes.
No partnership between airlines covers all three ocean crossings in the South Hemisphere (and Sky Team does not cover any of the crossings).
However, Star Alliance flies to all destinations except the Eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is the route of LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only choice if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the western coast of South America.
The ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan fought against Azerbaijan in 1994.

The French language variants spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French language spoken in France and are similar enough to be mutually understandable.
The numbering system in parts of Belgium and Switzerland, which speaks French, has some small characteristics that differ from French spoken in France, and the excuse of some words is somewhat different.
However, all the Belgians and Swiss francs have studied standard French in schools, so they would understand you even if you use the standard French numerical system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means “hi. ”
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malaysians in rural areas, waving means “come - like forefingered to the body, which is a gesture used in certain Western countries, and should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveler in Spain may mistakenly take the wave of greetings for leaving, which includes the hand facing the one waving (not the person he waves) as a gesture to return.
Assisting languages are artificial or fictional languages that are designed to help communicate between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They differ from the language of lingua franca, which have become natural or organic languages that have, for some reason, become a dominant way of communicating between speakers of other languages.
During the daytime heat, passengers can experience mirages that produce the illusion of water (or other things).

These highlands are often referred to as “seeds, ” meaning a wide, open, tree - free space, an immense expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are commonly called ‘hei’, meaning a tree - free swamp, often covered by the time-out.
Glaciers are not stable, they are sliding down the mountain, which will cause cracks on the ice that can be hidden under the snow bridges.
Walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse, and cracks can be closed.
On the edge of the glaciers, huge blocks break off, fall, and can even bounce away from the edge.
The peak of the tourist season for the hill stations is usually during the summer of Michael.
