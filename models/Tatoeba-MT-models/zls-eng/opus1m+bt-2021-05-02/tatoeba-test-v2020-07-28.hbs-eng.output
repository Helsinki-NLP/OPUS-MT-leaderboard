He tried to kill himself.
Tom told me to ask you.
Everyone knows that.
She enjoyed yesterday's party.
Just tell me the truth.
Birds sing.
Be careful: we write nationalities, day by week, and language by capital letter in English.
I love watching you work.
Birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
As far as we know, Tom's guilty.
I love you.
Tom's a bookworm.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, only if they got that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom pull the fatter end?
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
He was running.
That's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
No pain, no science.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I'm mad at you.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
He's not a scientist, but he is our friend.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating garlic in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we got lucky.
Don't talk.
Is French taught in your school?
Come have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I'd say so.
You're running away.
I took the first step.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to an American Polish hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
Will you dance with me?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he says here.
Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I'm staying.
His manner of speech bothers me.
I've never thought of it that way.
I know Tom let you down.
He's always dissatisfied.
Tom was badly injured.
My shirt isn't dry yet.
If you need help, let me know.
I made a first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25 p.m.
That was a little weird.
Plants are growing.
Does that guy read and write Japanese?
Tom put the ticket on the table.
I called him.
It was all just an accident.
Tom's never even seen us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
Now a word from our sponsor.
I'm not happy with my condition.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help himself.
Our eyes can't see the infrared rays.
It's time for bed.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted a more beautiful cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the hairdryer?
I ordered it already.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I feel bitter.
Did you return the book to the library?
Fadil wanted to steal Dani's money.
Tom loves a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows everything about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man of many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Tom was Maria's first love.
The motion was put to a vote by raising hands.
He often quotes Shakespeare.
Keep listening.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
We know her.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
An accident happened on Sunday around 3:00.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
That doesn't affect him at all.
I thought the food was great.
Fifty families live in this small village.
Tom is an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
- You look fat.
Learning language isn't easy.
You got a headache?
You have to learn English step by step.
That's better than he ever had before.
Tom and Mary differ as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment for him. One such desire is for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would long for death.
Water's a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my father-in-law.
I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Here's the news.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made of milk and cream.
I'm alone.
Okay, how about you?
Don't drink water.
I'm not trying to ruin your day.
It was just the beginning.
The book is a sale.
The price of gold changes daily.
Be nice.
Look around!
Tom got married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You have no permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a sass.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Could anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brutus?
The house Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It's snowing.
I thought you might need some help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.
He has been elected president.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They've formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom was jumping up and down.
Tom's dog is lying down.
You look like your dad right now.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
No, I don't.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message to Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
The little flowers bloom at night.
I counted to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
You should try it someday.
I'm staying home with Grandma and Grandpa for the weekend.
What do you have in mind?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his nerves.
Bathroom's upstairs.
Tomorrow's Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work at the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals tortured animals.
I'll live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be mad and yelling at us?
Please stop here.
How important is that?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm getting used to it.
It's not that bad.
It seems she was offended by what he said to her.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Parts speak more than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
Enough!
It's hard working with you.
Tom's got a lot of weight.
The lion is king of the jungle.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me your photos!
It takes a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I'm so tired I can't study.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very considerate.
When will you be gone?
This report isn't very good.
I want a new bike.
It points out that this last move by the government has a multiple significance.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
Five brothers worked on a farm together.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
His hair almost covered his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh-largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean up the snow from the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who forged his diploma to get into college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had crossed my mind.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I'm gonna finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not an essay problem, it's all these terrible questions and explanations that drive me crazy!
He's here this weekend.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started yelling.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a bit.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this on?
Most people like chicken.
Has Tom gone mad?
I didn't do it either.
You ready?
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned badly.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch yourself here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by splashing rocks on your car.
I became a pensioner after 14 years of office work.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't support it.
I just took a bath.
Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
Generally, children like candy.
Tom's going to cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much harder than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of dying.
I can't fix the car by myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
You hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled a thicker end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's not even.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's clear Tom is ill.
I started learning English when I was 12. I was interested in languages, but not in that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a novice.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom's not getting away.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle that.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
That's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just lame.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm a homosexual?
Anyway, he'll be here for sure.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm getting paid.
I feel sorry for you.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be done soon.
It's learnable by what it's done.
You'll never walk alone.
It's Tom you want.
The police are after me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
No one said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocrate.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I failed.
We know.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
You should face up to that reality.
Light waves pass through space and different materials.
We managed to escape right on time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
The carthage must be destroyed!
How much does that cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could, uh, talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take some.
Who knows what'll happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry from all this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of that word.
The spider tickles me.
He talks about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused, he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
We'll sort of go through the jungle.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not telling anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated for the proportional part of the annual interest charge.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money too.
Ancient history.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the file name before you try to return deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.

We're not gonna let you die.
I've got a lot going on.
Tom wants to teach his kids the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been getting ready for the exam?
Some book that describes wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You shouldn't throw rocks at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't fuck around.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary's a retired nurse.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull the fatter end?
Give me all the money.
Mer provided a great deal of support.
Those are nice shoes.
A girl sees a boy.
We call Robert \"Bob\"
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.
The government fell after the parliament vote.
You're not funny.
Tom left instead of Mary.
The notebook's not yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car down the street.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting on my turn.
That's not the main question.
I've been so upset by the news.
Girl's eating bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I've passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a syringe.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you need to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's the area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We were walking through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got out at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
If I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Are you gonna send this as a postage?
What are you suggesting?
It's said that love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved forward slowly.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm too late, aren't I?
Don't look.
It looks blue to you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there willingly
We're all out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
There was something lying on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She called him, but he didn't hear it.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He'll probably win the championship.
After the silence, what most accurate shows is the unspoken is the music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a busy day ahead of you.
That's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read or write?
Justice must be fully served.
Tom and Mary would make a wonderful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass the exams?
We're gonna have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I strongly support your comments.
I'm gonna try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we build a group on Facebook so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we have a deal?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me a number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom was scared of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
Can I take a look at your ticket?
What happens now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They set up the library with new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a knock error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to do what's best for a student's life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas eve.
Tom's got naughty hair.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that.
We're gonna miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is growing.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom's the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.

Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Gardening's fun.

I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
I got a thing for her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you right now.

You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everybody appreciates Henry.

It was a great success.
Sit down, please.

I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I have to drink something.

How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.

That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?

I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm happy.

Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
Tom didn't seem to do what he had to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom drove the flies away.
He stopped smoking abruptly.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.

Tom asked Mary to disprove it.
I've got a cat and a dog, and the cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's a cup on the table.
That makes me so angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I just assumed you were busy.
Don't you think?
Would you like me to take a look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very kind of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I wish that had crossed my mind.

She doesn't speak English.
I saw the cat.
Paris is snowing.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I have no idea what was going on in his head so he can turn down such a favorable suggestion.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to come out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom's tough or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us were eating potato salad hot dogs.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.

I made a promise.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly became love.
Don't be a lesbian.
This is how it's supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmund Dantes, after he became the victim of a conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.

My French is bullshit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
It stinks.

She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his bad spot.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
He's got one foot in his grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy about electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letter earlier.
Don't drink the water out of the dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today, I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's a picture of her.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why are the rabbit ears big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
The best thing to do in a walk is work things out.
You're working too hard.
This one's really cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I really enjoyed it.
That's something to be trusted for.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I was late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this paper.
It's 5:00 in the morning in Brazil.
Tom suggested Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom's been arrested three times.
This isn't that much fun.
That's a very big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
You don't learn that at school.
Is it clear?
Not that I'm getting out tonight.
\"Will you think about- \"Yes, I will,
Get out of there.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop fighting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not going to do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Well done!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What's your first song you ever wrote?
Tom might get hot.
I just want to get out of the way.
Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
A number of words were borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let it get away with this.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
She's in first year of law school.
I looked for grape juice.
I've been thinking about my family.
Colourless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Because of the bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I take your dictionary?
My liquid knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for the expression of mine, often contradictory, emotion.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing in this town to do.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a tremor of the heart.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you for being anxious.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm scared of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we prevent that from happening?
His novels are popular among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Have I really been so happy?
What kind of insurance do I have to choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say \"Thank you\" in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His accident taught me a lot of things.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
The storm should not affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
No girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk around.
As most 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the phagot.
United States Secretary John Carey broke his right femur in a cycling accident in France on Sunday.
Where's a lot of grandmas, they're bald kids.
Tom's as tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were amazing.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are jammed.
Did you fully recover?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a snog.
Don't move!
An accident was filmed by an observer.
Did I drop it?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually became love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's just for nothing.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxury dishes, will be more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He turned himself in.
Italy is a very pretty state.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
The violent criminals were often child molesters.
I want you to introduce me to Tom.
After a long consideration, I ended up doing things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He's a word-saving man.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house yesterday for dinner.
Look at the size of it!
That's the truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom interfered with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom's ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve for yourself.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You failed me.
You shouldn't judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
What is this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wasn't going to tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
Tim's as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
Then what are your plans?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many small towns in England, has a rather long history.
Tom shut the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and broke up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
Phase one is complete.
You'll be famous.
He's got plenty of money, even extra money.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was safe about himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She's taking care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Do you learn French in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna be okay.
It's important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not liking anybody.
The brakes are sticking.
Find Tom.

It's simple as beans.
I'm a little worried right now.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was 13.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.

I owe you an apology.
Nothing can be done but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Drop dead!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need my watch fixed.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I got it all wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.

I'm gonna be late.
I had a quick lunch.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.

You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.

It's all quiet again.

Can we order, please?
What does he do?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take your time, Tom.
Can you set an example?
I don't intend to go to Busto with you this weekend.
He stole a very valuable diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a snot.
Just like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That's not like you.
It's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.

This ticket is worth a month.

Turns out the price is lower than I thought.
Some people think spontaneously burning people is really happening, but I'm not really convinced.

Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about that.
Tom's alone.

How does Tom do that?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you sleep enough last night?

I thought you'd already taken care of it.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom's been shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what could happen.
You do well to those who hate you.
I nodded once.
Hello, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
What's your favorite TV star?
Tom passed out.
How was your day?

You're embarrassing her.
My phone's about to go off.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch our legs.
I'm going on a trip.
That'll be all for now.
Interesting, he's coming today?
The powerless must be protected against the mighty.
I don't know if your tongues are related.
I thought you'd be busy.
I want to rent a car, show me the price list.
How long has the turtle lived?
Haven't you done enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom was trying to impress me.
Here they appear to be enjoying the fountain with ice, beer and an excursion basket.

What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Were you in an accident?

I pissed him off.
That's very rare.
I pretended I didn't see it.
I tried to be nice.
Could you ask her to call me?
I pretended I didn't see it.
Have you seen my house?
It's getting dark.
Don't yell.
You know your rights.
You can't go in that room.
That's the point.
The whole town was underwater.
I didn't know where I was from.

I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He has a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does she make per month?
What a stupid question!
I'm restless.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was as angry as a lynx.
Get up and introduce yourself, please.
We're all looking to see a movie.
You have to solve your own problems.
Where do you live, Tom?
He laughed happyly.
Tom's got some good notes.
That's no reason to panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom was celebrating his graduation last week.
I'll sit at the table there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't you say that!
Your book is twice as big as mine.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's have a look.
Tom writes something in his diary every night, however tired he is.

Will I be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
I can resist anything but temptation.
You just need to practice.

I'm confused.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring the fan?
How much time do I have left?
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
You kind of remind me of Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you do.
Did you write down the number?
You're under oath.
I fainted.
I wish I'd known.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
It's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Tom managed to save just a little money.
I'm going to leave work early today.
Are you enjoying your work?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for anything in particular?
Its composition is very good, except for a few excuses.

Haven't you done enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom's gonna give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I have a feeling it's gonna rain.
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
He's got a few friends.
Have you been sleeping?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Tom seems a little distracted.
I'm really happy about that.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's certainly no cause for concern.
I took my wig off.
My life was good.
That's my cat.
Here is a large amount of minor errors and petty misunderstandings that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I didn't have any complaints until now.
I can ski.
He's standing right there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the front desk.
He's known as the great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer your question?
Go look for Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot him in the leg!
- Are you serious? - I'm serious.
Why are you mad at me?
I'd prefer a checkup in the morning.
That didn't like the way Mary talked to him.
We need to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom has to learn more if he's going to finish class.
I'm sick of fighting.
I wrote a poem about what happened here last year.
I can't try it!
It's too easy that way.
Where'd that come from?
I'm not telling anyone you did this.
Bears are very dangerous.
Really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from a bookstore.
We had to call the police last night.
I'm worried about you.
Have they ever had a car accident?
She's Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come pick me up.
I like the way you arranged the place.
She decided not to go.
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
It's a fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did it, didn't I?
Nobody noticed she was gone until the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom was?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
It's not coming to me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom was driving a bus earlier.
Would you like some coffee?
Many birds are trapped moving south.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
That article was hooked up in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar has been replaced by honey as a sweetener.
You're about to make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll go.
What's all this fuss about?
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
There's a bus stop near our school.
Don't drink water.
I'm adopted.
No one knows what's gonna happen next.
I made up my mind.
Do you have a copy?
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
We're going to the movies.
I don't understand why they're such good friends, they barely have anything in common.
Dan's a linguist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent print. You know it and I know it. There is no one who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, but in advance he would know that it will never appear in the press. I get a regular salary to keep my honest opinion out of the paper I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for the same things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what you truly think, would find out on the street, in search for some other job. If I let my right opinion appear only in one issue of the news for which I work, I would get fired from the job in less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie, to pervert, to slander, to slander, to invest a monster in front of whose feet, to sell this country and its people for their day of life is the truth, to the people who want to live in the bar and the bar of others.
I'm not worried at all.
The bedroom's upstairs.
It's mine, it's not his.
I could use some help.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom couldn't get Mary to make a cake for John's birthday party.
Tom's writing very well.
Tom has frowned on himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
It's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it on my hands.
Somehow you let me realize you wanted me to ask you out.
It is recommended that you not record your passwords where others can see them.
That's so funny.
Look again.
How could I do that?
Did you eat anything?
Tom supported us too highly.
She's got it together.
What are you gonna do today?
I'd rather not be involved at this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Taxi's expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom's gonna be okay.
It's no use trying to talk him into it.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The Milky Way is a huge belt of distant stars similar to our sun.
Who's that?
I could really talk to Tom.
He lives around in a white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing just fine.
I could go with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.
He's a man of great experience.
A beautiful blonde sun was on the beach.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
We're trying.
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
I need your help.
Stop!

The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
What's this about?
I'd love to kiss you.
He owned a lot of land, a long time ago.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Tom laughed at the idea.
She wore imposeable clothes.
I'll be right there.
He was awfully skinny.
I'm sorry.
What did she look like?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
The colosseum was used until 217 but then it was struck by lightning and burned.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It's time for you to go to sleep.
You're absolutely right.
I consider him an enemy.
You deserve it.
I'm working.
Does Tom have a lawyer?
You changed my life.
Can I take your dictionary?

This has taken forever.
The last time you pissed off your mother.
I want to go home and that's why I'm crying.
That's your problem.
Too late.
I'm afraid of heights.
She made the right choice.

Okay, how about you?
Life's been a pain in the ass.
They got married in secret.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to.
Maybe Tom's not hungry.
I always think about it.
Excuse me.
I never should have listened to you.
Tom wanted to be okay.
I have to get used to it first.
Please repeat?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?
Tom eats chocolate almost every day.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Let's sit down.
Don't talk.
I could come with you.
We get close, try to understand each other, but we just hurt each other and we cry.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Someone spent a lot of money to decorate this place.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
It used to be quiet in here.
I won't try to predict the future.

I'm really looking forward to being here.
We're from the same sort.
What's up, Tom?

I've been waiting.

Be yourself.

Just give Tom a second.
I'm used to it.
Tell Tom to try harder.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
I already told her.
I shouldn't have been in such a hurry.
Check it out.
Are you done washing dishes?
I always thought that was weird.
It's a tight ring.
All we know is Tom's guilty.
She abandoned her children.
Thank you very much. You should also feel free and ask for help in the future.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Tom wasn't acting like a normal boy.
A few newspapers ran the story.
I'll talk to Tom about that.
Tom's got his head down.
So we set up a small portable hut that can be divided into two parts and can be driven anywhere.
If it's not okay, it's not the end.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to sleep over.
Let's get to know each other!
Are you done yet?
It's a lack of being ugly.
That can't be true.
Tom's got a great memory.
Please don't say that.
We're going to the movies.
Is it yours?
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about that.

I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom very much.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
My French isn't that good yet.
Can't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think maybe we were too aggressive.
We're never going back there.
No one knows what she's become.
The fish is good for you.

Hello.
What are you gonna do this summer?
He put his thoughts on paper.
I'm a novice.
I'm used to it already.
Listening to music is my bloated way of relaxing.
I wasn't involved in the conversation.
Tom got on the bus.
You've been very quiet.
Freedom comes with responsibility.

You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?

What do you intend to do from now on?
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I love grapes.
What are you supposed to do?
It didn't matter to me.

I'm really happy about that.
The lion is king of the jungle.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
Wind is a cheap and clean energy source
I got off the train.
You promised to help me.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
Are you saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't buy it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?

Are you a Ugur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix my own car.
Zini!
Please hurry.
Tom's nodding his head.
Should we tell someone?
He's flooded with the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
Don't be mad.

He's been working ten hours straight.
This one's pretty cool.
That publishing company is solid.
Pick one.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.

Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Have you seen it?

We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.

At the next intersection turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
You too, Brutus?
Are you dyslexic?
I wish I'd known.
I often borrow books from Tom.
Change your clothes.

A great group of people have gathered together.
I'm working on my project.
All is well prepared in advance.
I'm not counting on that.

How would you feel if she left your wife?
Can you prove that?
Dead end.
It's so easy to write this pen.
Tom called his hamster Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don't change your mind so often.
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I don't like learning in this heat.
I'd rather not be involved at the moment.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing in this village to do.

You're all for me.
I want to get married.
Hold my backpack.
I did check some things.

I'll give you what you want.
It's pure escapism.
Who did you write the letter to?
I may need some help.

I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty remarkable.
Tom's got his shoulders down.
Bad things are going to happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Look into her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my father about this.
What does she study for a soviet?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Where's the dog?
Did you fully recover?
We had a hard fight.
Tom's still hiding out there.
Okay, how about you?

Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We have no other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do it.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really that individual?
I asked Tony one question.
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialty?
He couldn't help but laugh at her jokes.
She freed the bird from the cage.
I'm twice Tom's age.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't affect it.
And now that I remember everything I experienced, I really learned a lot.
That's exactly what I was going to say.
I wasn't too surprised.
I saw him pull something like a pot out of a box.

He's my rival in business.
I prefer a tent with a stormy blanket, along with cross bars due to wind stability and snow drifts, and this has to be a two-layer tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
It's very sensitive.
This is my wife Edith.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost money, family, friends.
Now introduce yourself using these sentences!
My name is not you; it's Ricardo.
Where are we gonna meet?
We need to consider all options.
I hope this never happens again.
There's a high probability that it's going to rain tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
It has a nice flower, but it doesn't produce fruits.
I'm touched.
Tom told me to knock on the door.

I'm not working out.
Is there a reason you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We've got to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
Who are you?
I'll get what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Don't yell at me.

I'm about to start looking for you.
He's leading a busy life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
I've lost my mind stream.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got a good bet.

Where did you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little dizzy.
I saw the bus.
It's no big deal.
Tom's wise enough not to do anything like that.
I brought these reports so you could take a closer look at them.
I'm not as rich as we'd like.
Can I kiss you?
Get on.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

He was born in a small town in Italy.
What did you two do?

That's enough for today.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.

I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
I almost forgot my passport.

Many tourists visit Kyoto.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's humane to sin, to forgive is divine.
I passed all the tests.
I just needed some time.
I have to go.
Step aside.
It's his, isn't it?
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
You never make it on time.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Exactly when did you do it?
Someone probably told her, but it wasn't me.
Tom was wearing black jeans.
Must have been fun.
What have you to say?
This is a book.
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this seat taken?
It was just like that.
Add more water.

I was just acting like I don't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Could you pass me the remote?
He's 3 inches taller than me.
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy yourself.
Did he meet his goals?
Karin's an Austrian.
Give me some milk.
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually have for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
There is not one thing in this phase of world history in America that there is no such thing as an independent press. You know that and I know it. There is not one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would already know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I have been regularly given my salary to keep my honest opinion outside of the news I am working for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what you honestly think, you would find out, on the street, in search of some other business. If I had allowed my right opinion to appear only in one issue of the news for which I am, I would be fired from work for less than 24 hours.
Tom's a salesman, too.
I'm twice Tom's age.
That's exactly what I said was gonna happen.
Testing the new engine will take place today.
How strange!
Do you think it's worth saving these letters?
Come and sit down.
