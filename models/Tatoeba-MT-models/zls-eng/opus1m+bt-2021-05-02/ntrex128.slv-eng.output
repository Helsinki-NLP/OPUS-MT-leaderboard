Members of the Valian congregation are concerned that they are “like Mupetka”
Some members of the congregation are appalled by the proposal to name themselves the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, the so-called Member of the Babylonian Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Valižan Parliament.
Members of the Assembly in the entire political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that in their group they were worried about “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means silly and pwp poop.
A member of the Assembly of Plaid Cymru told their group as a whole \"not satisfied\" and proposed other options.
The Valizan Conservative said that his group of “open spirits” was a small difference in the pronunciation between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the expression “w” is similar to the pronunciation of the letter “in” in the Yorkshire term.
The Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to present changes to the name, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for the members of the assembly will, of course, have to be taken by the members themselves.”
By law of Wales Act 2017, the Valiscan Assembly was empowered to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valizan Parliament Assembly.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission has chosen the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but in the public consultation, the most support was given to the option of “MWP”.
The members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who must submit a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of members of the Assembly and the creation of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their designation.
Macedonians will decide by referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote whether they will turn their country's name into \"the Republic of Northern Macedonia\".
By voting, they want to resolve decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and have repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaevo, claim that changing the name is simply the price they must pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's Church have been silent, as the churches in Harlem face difficulties
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes there were bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
\"Today is not one or the other.\"
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
\"People are having a different time today.
The bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly go.\"
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that it will soon be reinitiated.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with common government (condominium), where people who would not help prisoners in the neighbourhood who remained.
“The great majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will come when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that people who will move to these condoms will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolis Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community who served nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of the Honorable John Howard Johnson, who on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who refused to hire or support black people.
The fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned for reconstruction, they ordered the doorbells for the crash.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “rings for poor people”.
In July, an expert named them a little differently: “cultural treasure” and “incomparable historical instrument”.
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first prize bells played by a darker musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he knocked on larger bells.
Mr. Merryweather said that St. Martin’s church did not replace him.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s Church has been going on a complicated story with architects and contractors; some have brought church laikas and others to the diocese.
In July, the Church wrote to the bishops that she was worried that the diocese would \"try to pass the costs\" to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about the visibility of transparency.
Shark injured 13-year-olds while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beach Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends when he heard the boy scream for help, and then he swam to him with a group and helped to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just impressed because he caught the lobster, and then he found out that he was yelling \"He bit me!
He bit me! \"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole clavicle.
“I cried out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injury to the upper body.
They were responsible for 48 hours for preventing access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Saintsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful wheels as they have in the supermarkets, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while selling clothes and household appliances is falling, the larger beautiful corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country and in more stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves used previously for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says that they will double the offer of their beauty products on 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also get more space in trade-like brand areas such as Boots.
Supermarket is also reinvigorating its buttic supply of cosmetic products, so most products are vegan – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfume store will test a concession in two Sainsbury stores. The first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and the daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops, supermarkets need to make more efforts to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores like supermarkets will be like supermarkets, as a chain of supermarkets is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl with several services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury Group opened outlets Argos in several hundred stores and also the Habitat trade since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and the acquisitions were more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s shared a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the connection ended after the dispute about the distribution of drug profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores of Celesio owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds has said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan, as in four stores they are expected to expand the offer of luxury brands for skin care, including brands La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially qualified colleagues who will be available for counselling.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones \"angry\" because Holly Willoughby withdrew from a job worth 11 million pounds
The Dragons Den (Good Business) star is furious because television director Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from the 11 million-pound business with his life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand clothes and accessories Truly.
The business pair company compared the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
The head of this Morning, 37, has announced on Instagram that it is retreating.
Holly Willoughby was pissed off by Dragons Dan Peter Jones's show star, as she retired from their profitable business with a life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “angered” when a gold girl television on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire admitted that because of her new businesses – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – she no longer has time to devote to their brand of clothes and accessories Truly.
The company compared the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and announced that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw has completely amazed all those involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, since opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of goods prepared for sale.”
Experts believe that going to the head of this Morning, which is among the most interesting banks in Britain, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays in opening up.
Moreover, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, spent ten years with Jones and his wife, Taro Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Cappov in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couples were resting together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador to M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show I”m A Celebrity.
A source near Jones yesterday evening said: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Hard talk »and then we fell in love«
He joked about the criticism of the media for a comment that some consider \"unpresidential\" and a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, with his mocking \"novelary\" voice, said:
\"I didn't give anything up.\"
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting, and their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step against North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a \"proper response\" to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States is continuing sanctions that continue to press.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
\"We are doing great with North Korea,\" he said.
\"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.\"
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had resulted in positive results – they stopped rocket testing, helped free the hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
\"It can be a great presidency, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this loaded full scene, we have 200 people standing here,\" Trump said and pointed to the crowd directly ahead.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds dead
For example, when removing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been moved, natural disasters were not declared, which is a condition for sending international aid.
\"In many cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, which is why the situation is somewhat complicated,\" said Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization consists of a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
On Saturday, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, he said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palujo and determining whether they will allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes are permanent in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Acech, this is not a common practice on other shores.
The apparent absence of a warning siren at the tsunami in Palu was likely to contribute to the loss of lives, although a warning was in force.
Traveling among the many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best of times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok, sails towards Palou, but will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesia infrastructure at the heart of his electoral campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit poses a problem for Jok’s administration in re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge score for late Equation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a hit in 89 minutes.
Sturridge accepted the Xherdan Shaqiri award 25 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal at the back of his 1-0 team.
He put the ball on his left and set off a shot at the remote gate.
The arrow traveled high above the crime scene towards the right upper corner of the neck.
In the end, the ball dropped through the goalkeeper, Kepa Arrisabalga, and fell into the goal.
“I simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players such as Shaq, they always drag it as far as they can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much and simply chose to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime with a hit by the Belgian actor Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The wise man in this action gave the fifth ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith in the middle quickly passed and ran forward.
Then he went through the defense nicely, and Hazard got into the penitentiary.
Hazard was ahead of defense and shot at the remote gate through Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker with his left foot.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Group League of Champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 pm.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll of tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832.
The death toll of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Disaster Agency reported on Sunday morning.
A representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that there were many people due to Friday's 7.5 earthquake, which triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
The palace, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is salted with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police launched a murder investigation after a woman was found in Birkenhead in Mercyside this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 p.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street Street Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder.
The police are calling on everyone who's been in the area who's seen or heard anything that they're making a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial stages, but I call on everyone who was near John Street Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something in the car cam footage to contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police representative confirmed that the woman was a woman resident of Birkenhead and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are informing the women's family.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he lost his word.
The residents were now told it could take several hours before they could enter again.
The police heard how he explained to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
She keeps saying \"it's so terrible.\"
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and another one outside.
A number of police officers were standing inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
All people with any information ask to write on @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and state the journal 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of the \"Rewrite of History\" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society has marked Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and “try of rewriting history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that Oliver Cromwell’s image outside the Westminister’s palace would become a target.”
In the English civil wars of Cromwell, Iconoclasm did not order or carry out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
A brilliant presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of the 19th century, witness to the 19th - century opinion and is part of the history of personality, which some still think is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell many (may be even more late in the 19th century than today) see Parliament’s protector against external pressure, in his case of course monarchies.
Is this a purely accurate performance, it is the subject of continuous historical discussions.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has created further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time Lord was a protector also deserve celebration and remembrance.\"
Killing pig crushed Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwestern market.
The male, identified only by the name of Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered with blood in the vicinity of the pig market in the town of Liupanshui province of Guizhou, reported at South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig raec is preparing for the vaccination of pigs at the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin arrived from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig with a bloody mouth in it.
Forensics confirmed that 250-pound pig crushed the farmer to death.
\"The brother's legs were bloody and removed,\" the cousin with the name \"Wu\" quoted Guyang Evening News as saying in the newspaper.
Security cameras showed Yuang coming to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evaning News that the pig had been shut down so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the management of the market are scheduled to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering severe physical injury.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Babylonian farmer against a tractor, but then the woman rejected the animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “sprayer”.
\"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown a sufficient measure of respect,\" he said.
To the southeast of the United States due to the remains of the Rosa hurricane comes heavy rain
According to reports, Orcan Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and is getting worse.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and the United States of America.
From Sunday from 5.00 in the morning after the eastern time of the Orcan 1st category with a speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure is being strengthened, which is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the Bay California peninsula as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture toward the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture, mixed with low air pressure, will create heavy rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flood disposal, and the possibility of groundwaters in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest parts, mainly over the majority of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rainfall is expected.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into tiny rivers and storms will bring the local suns of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low-air pressure area will bring local rain to the parts of the coast of Southern California.
The rainfalls may be above 12 mm, which may result in a slight drop of the floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropicals will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and on Monday morning, late Monday and Tuesday the rainfall will spread.
The heavy rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of dramatic differences in temperature in the central part of the United States.
There are 20 degrees of difference between Canada City, Missouri and Omaho, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle down and expand again.
The majority of the Central and Eastern United States will enter warm October with temperatures of about 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the north-east.
We could have 27 °C in New York on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good options for temperatures above the US average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on six television networks have seen the Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault that was due in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political path continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's transformation in the last minute: the agreement drawn by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI would carry out a unitary investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she is 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was taping her in a winery state and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a stormy testimony that 100 percent was convinced that this didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday’s witnessing is expected to see more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS TV networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for other networks that were playing testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network networks.
In addition, Nielsen usually has a few problems with the number of viewers watching the program at the offices.
For a easier performance, ratings are similar when playing the football game finals or award awards from the American Film Academy.
Fox News Channel TV, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, leads to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
In second place, ABC has 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement to vote in favour of Kavanough, the CNN and CBS TV cameras recorded the protestors yelling at him when he tried to enter the elevator on Friday morning to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the construction, he took a few minutes to take a look, which was caught live by the CNN TV.
“I’m standing here before you,” a woman told him.
\"You think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have the power, while many women are helpless.\"
Flake said that his office made a statement, and added that he would tell more at the committee's hearing, and then the door was closed.
All TV networks were broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate within the next week, which was called by a minority Democratic Party.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took his decision.
Flake's voice was decisive because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused of \"playing political games\" at Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the European Union of \"playing political games\" with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said that the proposal was that Britain and the EU were paying the other customs duties \"in total absurd\".
Fire on Wade Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a murderous shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to Baron Rouge's police report, a 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and sentenced to prison for second-degree murder.
The officials published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that during the battle Sims had lost his sunglasses.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police issued a statement saying he confessed to shooting Wade to the death.
The security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The inspector from East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
For assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest, the police thank the special unit for the fugitives of the louisian state police, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the police of the South University and the inhabitants of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked local law enforcement authorities for their \"securities and search for justice\".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimetre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season he collected 5.6 points on average and 2.6 jumps on the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team said that the team was \"strengthened\" and \"in shock\" due to Wade's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Vulcan vomits ashes on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes of the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, since the crater activity was reinforced and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre observed several cases of thunder and earthquake suns.
The pictures on the social networks showed thin layers of ash covering the windshield of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed increased activity in a volcano that lies 72 kilometers south-east of the capital, after a 7.1 degree earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan named \"Don Goyo\" has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalonia Separatists before the anniversary of vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors supporting independence faced anti-exist police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catholic polarised secession vote.
A group of masked separatism supporters held back by anti-violent police units covered them with eggs and metal powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, usually flooded with tourists.
Later, fights took place, and police officers had to use pendreka to stop the conflicts.
The supporters of independence, who called out for hours \"without forgetting, without forgiveness\", faced protestors who supported unity and shouted \"Let Spain live!\".
As reported by local media, fourteen people in protests have suffered minor injuries.
The year following the referendum from October 1st, which was labeled illegal in Madrid and celebrated by the Catholic separatists, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although the participation was low, as the opponents of the secession had largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalonia authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year after trying to stop the elections from going to the polls in the region in violent conflicts.
Overnight, groups who support independence camped out against the voters in order to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
Demonstration continued, but they had to take a different path.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no more hope that Catalonia would become independent.
»We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry happy because they could vote, but now we are stuck,\" he said.
Despite the important, although close victories in the regional elections last December, the Catalon parties supporting independence have found it difficult this year to maintain an initiative, since many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with his phone in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politics on both sides.
\"The tension is rising,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders, who have been in custody since the end of last year prior to the trial, announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
\"Candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn aggression in the democratic values and repression that we have seen in the Spanish government,\" he said.
Londonderry: Arrested Men Who Run Into The House With Car
Three men 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested for driving a car into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on the street of Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said that the door and the building themselves were damaged.
At some point, they were supposed to shoot a crossbow at the car.
He won the 1.0 against the Rangers with the Mengai win.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston provided victory
He was the only one who had ever known him.
Dolly Mengaja's shot took care of the difference, as Gary Holt's team tied up with Hibernian's team in second place.
Gerrad's team thus lost its victory in the guests in this year's championship, and next Sunday they're waiting for Hearts, leading on a scale and behind which they're behind eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased his number of undefeated divisions in the six-game division and chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston wasted opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should have led it well before it hit, as the Rangers' directness caused a number of problems.
Scott Robinson got a breakthrough, but he sent the ball over the neck frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the door, and Craig Halkett fired his head over the goal line.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew that guests could be dangerous when they broke up in the attack.
And in this way, they also came up with the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston free shots, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and struck from the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a larger possession of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't break through, and the doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
The porter of the Rangers, Allan McGregor, took the shot of Scott Pittman with his foot, and Lithgow fired another livingston ceaseout in the attack by the goal.
The motions continued to arrive in Livingston's criminal space, but the locals refused all attacks, two offenses – Halkett's misdemeanor over Glenn Middleton's replacement and a hand-to-hand misdemeanor – and the judge did not decide.
»Excellent performance« Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to go beyond expectations on this path up.
The style of the game and the law haven't changed much since their return to the top, but Holt needs to be credited for the way he woke up the team since his arrival.
It was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role, and he set up excellently organized defenses, while Menga kept him on the alert of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although under the leadership Gerrard is exceptional, these standards are severely lacking.
There was a lack of goal shots – only once they successfully defeated the host defense – and this is a wake-up call for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky prevailed.
Today is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to the opening of the giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads have prevented the crowd from gathering from the mob, but many supporters have been able to get closer to seeing their president.
A number of hundreds of protesters, including many Kurds, who do not support Erdogan’s government and condemned Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the separation between visitors, whom some German Turks honour as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Car crash in Deptford: Bicycler fatally crashed
In London, the rider had a fatal accident in the car race.
The accident took place near the intersection between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 p.m. British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the ambulances came, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place only months after the rider died in a collision, in which the car driver fled, on Childers Street, about a mile from a Saturday accident.
The police have issued a statement that the officers are checking the identity of the man that they will be able to inform their relatives.
They set up road closures and diverted bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: six guards injured in the accident
Six prison guards were injured in an accident in a strictly protected man's prison, reported from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30 a.m. British summer time and still taking place.
Police officers from the tornado unit have called for an incident involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor facial injuries on the spot.
The prison staff representative said: “We have called for specially qualified personnel to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be taken responsible for this, and for this reason they may be further behind bars.”
In HMP Long Lartin prison, there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, he was reported to have been a prison warden in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called an extremist police unit in prison to intervene in a serious incident in which staff were attacked by pooling balls.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
The tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest desert and poses a threat to sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orcan Rosa is about to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he's gonna get close late on Monday with the rain.
In tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix noted that only »ten tropical cyclons maintained tropical storm status or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) raged the good 60km from the Arizona border.\"
The latest models of the national hurricane centre predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with a single rainfall of up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other regions of the South-West desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, is expected from 25 to 50 mm of rainfall, possible individual rainfalls up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the threat of sudden floods, the rain of hurricane Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as the dry season is currently taking place in the southwest.
\"By the American drought tracking centre, 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought,\" reportsweather.com.
The route of hurricane Rosa leads first to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of a hurricane at a speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach by means of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great threat to floods.
“We expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonoro, with the possibility of 250 mm of rainfall,” was reported on theweather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from the hurricane Ross or his remains is the abundant rain on the peninsula of Baj Caliphonia in the northwest of Sonora and in the US southwest Desert,” the national hurricane centre said.
These rainfalls can lead to life-threatening floods and floods in the deserts and earth’s plasmas in the mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested for suspected attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains \"stable\".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reports police from Avon and Somerset.
Police are calling on anyone who may have caught an event with a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh \"suffered the hostility and anger\" of the democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the hostility and anger of the democratic parties in the process of his appointment.
Cavanaugh testified Thursday before the convention, and he was clear and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault when she was a teenager.
Ford's charges were also witnessed during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage” that day.
“A vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with exceptional record of public service,” said a number of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when talking about the importance of the republican electoral participation in the mid-election elections.
\"For another five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I am really trying with the candidacy,\" he said.
\"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere.\"
Trump argues that the Democrats are on a mission of \"association and obstruction\".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, the Republican Party's consultant told CNN.
In the Indonesia earthquake and tsunamis killed by hundreds of people, the number of victims rising
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom took away the huge waves that pushed along the coast.
Hundreds gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the town of Palu, when six meters of waves hit the beach and many took to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesia disaster relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, knocked everything down on the ground,” he explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Paluj.
Air photos published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and a water - surrounded moose.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPT) said in its statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake is about 200 times greater than the power of a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as \"substantial\" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added, 540 people were injured, and 29 others are missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palou, in the Donggala area nearing the earthquake epicenter.
As Nugroho also said, communication has been cut off and there is no information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse,\" they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pal, but officials say that the waves arrived at the time of the issue of the warning.
An amateur video published on social networks sounds like a man on the upper floor screaming at people on the street on the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took away buildings and cars.
The authenticity of the recording was not immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power failure that interrupted communications around Palua, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated ones still need food and other basic living needs.
The airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Paluj on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesia tsunami has increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dossef, members of the Donggala World Vision organization arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard set up a refuge in their chambers, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of devastation.
\"They told me they saw many destroyed houses,\" he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience would not allow their arrival in Pal.
In accordance with the Indonesia regulations, overseas financing, stocks and staff assistance shall be permitted only if the site of the accident has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still treated as an accident at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"When the government says \"okay, this is a national disaster\", we can accept international aid, but no such status has yet been reached.\"
The second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palou, friends and relatives of missing persons hesitate to believe that their nearby miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who was trapped under the ruins for two days, and her mother's body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian team of the sailing parachute, trained two missing paratroopers for Asian games that ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others, trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students, according to Mr. Mandaggio.
“As an age in the field of paragliding, I bear my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers how she used to send her messages to the WatsApp app in Palujo when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel was going around the board of the sailing parachutes.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of two wise ones.
\"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered,\" he said.
The thieves stole USD 26,750 while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Left
According to the Newport police, the thieves stole $2,750 from a security guard named Bink’s who was filling the ATM in the Newport on the Leave on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, wrote in a public statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy.
While he was employed, another male “accommodated to the staff of Bink’s security services from behind” and stole a bag of cash for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone with information on suspects' identities should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The amendment was made on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “The Being With the Official Name of Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed \"Ye\" for some time and has also been used for the title of his eighth album, which he published in June.
The change comes just before his performance in Saturday Night Live, which is supposed to present his new album, Jandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who cancelled the performance for “the reasons”, said the creator of the show.
The word is short of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means “you” (the same),” West said at the beginning of this year, when he spoke about the album’s address to the radio host Big Boy.
\"So I am you and I am everyone to me.
Kanye, which means “only”, I changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
Album is a reflection of everything we are.\"
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without a thought and with capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military forces against civilians, just as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised on the Tlatelolco Plaza market that \"he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.\"
At a time when left-wing student movements started operating in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and to provide students with monthly subsidies and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education drag young people into criminal associations.
US should double artificial intelligence funding
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it uses for research in this area, says the investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments are coming after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
\"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite much for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,\" Lee said.
Duplicated funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supersile of artificial intelligence: China, Silician Valley and New World Order) published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible artistic intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player of the Othello game, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said that he was familiar with previous American government technological competitions, such as the robotics competition organised by the DARPA Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when he would next find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired the best from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US step up its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
\"I believe that we should automatically offer the green card to people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence,\" he said.
The Chinese State Council issued in July 2017 a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, distribution of money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which brings together industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to create the National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians to decide in referendum on change of country name
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in the referendum whether they would turn their country's name into \"the Republic of Northern Macedonia\". This would solve decades of conflict with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
On the basis of the proposed new name, the Governments agreed in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the amendment will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign voiced doubt that participation would be at least 50 %, if necessary, if the referendum was valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: \"Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting an agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaevo, claim that this is the price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that came after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia to be free to live under the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us,\" said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote that would be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has reported that no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
\"I came to vote because of my children, our city is in Europe,\" said 62-year-old Gjos Tanevski, an electorate from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, submitted their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set by those who would boycott the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door,\" Kavadarkov said.
\"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring a strongly needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
\"I believe that the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after the issue of his ballot.
He added that it would be a positive result of \"confirming our future\".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that the referendum would take place between 30% and 43% of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 per cent would be elected on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, electoral participation must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy that took office last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has played full Brighton's defenses and won
Sergio Aguero and Rachel Sterling played Brighton's defenses at the 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday in Manchester, Manchester.
Aguer's hit in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously simple.
At the start of the action, the Argentinan attacker accepted a pass in the middle of the playground.
He ran among the three Brighton defense actors and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the other on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in criminal space, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguera, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right of the network.
\"Aguero faces trouble in his legs,\" Coach Pep Guardioll told reporters.
\"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who provided blue wise men with an initial advantage in the First English League fight.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In this action Aguero accepted the ball deep on Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote gate.
The blues' attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it hit the field naked.
On Tuesday at 12.55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, in the group section of the Champions League, he will meet with Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play up against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals team is out of finals, so there's no special reason for another attack.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies team on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the finals because in the Western League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
The Rockies provided themselves on Friday by winning 5:2 over the Nationals team with the slightest invitation of the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
\"If we can't get anything, at least we can play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?\"
The name of the first metal machine for Sunday has not yet been published in the Nationals, but it is likely, in this case, to be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, which will be the first metal for 34 years, is on Thursday metal as a breaker and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
This season, Washington's rightist gathered 18 victories and 7 losses with the average permitted courses of 2.53 and 300 outstrikes with blows in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the mid-election elections.
\"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to go from the most important election of our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really trying with my candidacy, so I fight for excellent candidates everywhere,\" he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They are determined to retake power, using all possible means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push to gain strength and control. This is what they want, strength and control, but we won't give it to them.”
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of \"association and obstruction\".
“And you can see this in the last four days,” he said and labeled the Democrats as “Woe, Evil, Low and False”.
His name was pointed out by a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, with a loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. It was really a bad rumor of the body, the worst thing I've ever seen.\"
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
Those who express their opinion are impatient.
When my local client, an activist of the Momentum, told me no confidence, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Parliament members from a Labour Party who are not wanted to express my opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was similar because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was the proposal of a confidant for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
As regards the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe. Ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Friday notice of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that \"We wish the meetings were inclusive and productive\".
In the eight years that I am a member of the local Labour Party, Friday meetings were mostly exactly the same.
Unfortunately, at most meetings today, such a tone is not used and the promise of a \"friender and gentler\" policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It is increasingly obvious that the various views in the Labour Party are not admissible and whether they are acceptable to the leadership of the party in each opinion.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues I had previously thought to share similar political views expected me to change my opinion and take a position that I would never agree with – whether in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – criticism of social networks that call for insolence, condemn the politics of the environment and tell me that I should not be in a labor party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are intended for me are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of colleagues who face the flood of sexist or racist insults daily but who do not let themselves be terrified.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of mistrust or amendment of the rules of choice, the parties are becoming more narrower-minded.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice, to keep my head down and not to be so loud, and with me it will be “all right”.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, the negligence of the Tatcher government has been a cause for this, which is why the classroom in my elementary school has literally collapsed – I have tried to promote better public services as a local councilman or government minister for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, including my last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused because of my political views and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is travelling against the Brexit which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threats will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unbeatable Ayr on top of the scale
Two of them knew the experiments were somewhat distorted by the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a victory in this wonderful entertainment championship match of the day.
They're on the top of the scale now, and they're the only undefeated team in ten.
In the end, the weighing instrument on the home side was passed over by their top defense and better exploiting the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had good reason for pleasure.
\"In our games to date, we have passed many tests and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy,\" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ayra, opportunities have been taken better than we have.”
The hit on Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to lead, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with the Warriors, was numerically superior to Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted the attempt without conversion.
At the time of the misdemeanor, Climo increased leadership for Ayr before taking place at halftime and then turned the stand-alone attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which turned Baggot, has reduced the backlog to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to the serious injury to Ruardha Knott, which was carried away on the stretchers, and after that Ayr made progress in the Stafford McDowell trial, which was converted by Climo.
The temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the actor more with the unaltered attempt by Bruce Colvino at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card due to the interference of the Clim with no ball, MacPherson achieved a hit in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent the wing player Gregory Henry to the fifth host test.
The star of the Still Game series begins a new career in catering
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is apparently going to the inn, to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old in a popular BBC series for which he also wrote the script, played Jack Jarvis along with a long-standing partner in the comedy of Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be already planning his life around Craiglang.
According to official documentation, the Director of Adriftmorn Limited is.
The player refused to comment on the story, but the source indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the \"flowering hospitality\" in Glasgow.
»The sea is ours«: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Marine Blue Flags are out of the blue in public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicak to Amazon are covered with slogans: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.\"
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for a re-floating ocean in the Pacific.
This hope is now perhaps the largest in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting an international court ruling, which will be received by the Council on 1 October after five years of consultations.
\"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects a result,\" said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that – after decades of volatile talks – Chile must negotiate on the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
The President of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, has also high expectations of Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands shall not have the authority to assign a Chilean territory to Bolivia and shall not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case \"was not complicated\", said Paz Zárate, a member of the international law expert.
And for the past four years, they have not spoken in behalf of Bolivia, but may cost her a great deal.
\"The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea,\" Zárateev said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has taken out of Chilen’s favors, which may have remained, has explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that, it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The state hasn't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had unusually quickly taken a decision.
On Tuesday, Bolivia will bring \"an extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile\" and the possibility of \"finding 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits\", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin presidents – used the maritime issue as a political support.
\"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific,\" he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States has called on them to fulfill their promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo was apparently before the re-launch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong if they think that continuing sanctions and the opposition to the end of the Korean war will get North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to adjust the forecast without taking first decisive measures to disarm it.
Kim and President Donald Trump would like to meet again.
But there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the failure of a weapon seen by the State as the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris revealed the latest line of huge covers that come to stores with affordable brands in your vicinity
If you want to complete your collection of blankets or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to search ahead.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne, in their collections for spring and summer 2019, revealed on the fashion runway a collection of strange oversized covers, which blinded the style of the Paris week of fashion.
Very impractical blankets flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine’s piece, which is the most prominent, was a beige hat with wide shorts decorated with feathers similar to those in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a magic hat, and even ananas – but your heads will not warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many color masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashions.
One creation was similar to the diving equipment with a breather and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion acquaintances predict that giant blankets will come to shops near you.
The broad hats are closely followed by \"La Bombi\", a straw hat with 60-centre shorts were observed at Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for the exceptional non-practice hat, which was flooded by social networks, sent another large creation along the fashion runway – a beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit she was wearing.
The bag from the raffia in burnt orange colour, encapsulated with relics from the Rafija and with a white leather handle, was a central piece of the La Riviera collection on the Paris week of fashion for spring/ summer 2019.
The styler of the famous Luke Armitage said: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in shops for the next summer – because the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in exams that are further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council for Single Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Single schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, selected careers and a city that they have as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement an adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired selections in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, a conversation will make sense to him.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, the words imprint on his heart.\"
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that the languages at the top of the scale are the highest performance rates in single schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign language achieved an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Single Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved an excellent rating in Mandarin and that 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students received an excellent assessment.
This proves that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as a selection subject in the teaching plans of independent schools and are treated elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons why employers are struggling to fill jobs, 17% are attributed to the lack of language knowledge.
This is why language knowledge is becoming increasingly urgent when preparing young people for their future career.
In future job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
A 2013 survey of YouGov, covering more than 4,000 adults in the UK, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak foreign language well enough to talk, with France being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15 per cent.
Therefore, investing in learning the language is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, it will always be possible to select a number of languages taught by experts in this field in single schools.
Scotland's single schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need for success, no matter what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, and therefore this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “International Communications Skills”.
Single schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Single Schools
LeBron will debut in the Lakers uniform on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who look forward to the first LeBron James performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, waiting will soon be over.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's opening match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
\"More than one and less than 48,\" Walton explained at the Lakers official website.
On Twitter, the official rapporteur for the Lakers Mike Trudrell team wrote that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers before the season.
\"In this stage of my career to prepare I don't need games before the season,\" he said.
Trump Convention in West Virginia on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of conventions today in Wheeling, West Virginia, in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled conventions in the next week, including the stops in his favoured countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for freedom of office in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wishes to gain support for the upcoming interim elections, as it threatens the Republicans to lose control of Congress after the November vote.
At what hour will Trump's convention in West Virginia be held, and where will it be possible to see it online?
Trump convention in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.
The Trump convention in West Virginia can be seen live online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about the hearings of Bret Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidates this week, who became tense over charges of sexual misconduct, which is why confirmation in the Senate was expected to be postponed for a week to have the FBI conduct the investigation.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans, who are facing major elections in November, to gain new momentum.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five conventions were directed \"to encourage volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“The control at the Congress is so important to his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult season of the campaign” said a representative of Trumpo campaign who does not want to be appointed.
Today's convention at the Wesbanco Arena Centre in Wheeling, according to West Virginia MetroNews, could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in public opinion research.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president must come and raise him” in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still wants to win and keep hope ahead of Sunday's individual fights
After three one-sided games, maybe Saturday afternoon duels were two foursomes what Ryder’s Cup needed this year.
The fluctuating swing is a totally fictional sports concept, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the flutter go now?
\"They had six points of advantage, but now they have four, which is probably why this is a new momentum for us,\" Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has priority because it leads to four points and another twelve can get them.
But the Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have the wind in the sails, and, among other things, they were encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points of four.
Spieth was killed from the initial blow to the greenery and set a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to get louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and I were two points behind in the fourth game.
He followed the blow that led them to win the 15th hole with a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You simply need to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more than one point than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
Strange but charming two Europes have won four points of four and are infallible.
The two Molliwoods were the only ones who didn't boogie on Saturday afternoon, and the boogies also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way that apparently energy flows between them and the noisy crowd confirm the fact that they are the players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal Europe's victory than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
And possibly both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European celebrations would be premature.
Bobba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Because of boogie and two double boogies at the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis where they could not find a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Four-ball games and two-double games are an exception to following closely due to the communication between couples, the tips they give themselves, the tips they don't give themselves, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better than a team so far, and it has a great advantage before the last day, but the duel of two twins has shown that the US team also wants to win, some of which, especially on the American side, are in doubt.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe is going on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after the Saturday four-ball games and two-dair fights lead to 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave everything he had and with two victories over Tiger Woods and Le Golf National traded four points.
The European team of Thomas Björn, who sought to win the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had the strength of four balls over the American team who sinned and led in a series of 3-1 games in the morning.
The U.S. team had a better fight against two doubles, where they won two games, but they couldn't make up for it.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newspaper to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (the couple they named \"Molliwood\") after the sensational end of the week, only the second couple who won four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder's Cup.
After winning Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they turned out to be even more convincing to beat the wasted Woods and American newsman Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at moments, but lost 19 out of 29 games in a four-ball fight and a two-man fight, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was released for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duels of two and paired with Henry Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked on the first and third place on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the Europe team.
Three-time winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans on Saturday with two points.
They won with 2 and 1 decisively against the Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later came back and beat Poulter and Rory Mcilroy with 4 and 3 in the two-man battles, losing the first two holes.
Once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team came back after four points before the single fights, even though Furykov's team only needs the equalization to keep the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally”
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that further implementation of sanctions is causing increased mistrust in the United States of America and that, under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapon.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, Ri Jong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has taken a number of \"important measures in good faith\", such as the suspension of nuclear and missile experiments, the destruction of the site for nuclear experiments and the promise of not spreading nuclear weapons and technology.
“In spite of this, we do not see an adequate US response,” he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be convinced of national security and, under such conditions, we will not be unilaterally first disarmed.\"
As Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea concerning the resistance of Washington to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would have been rewarded for taking gradual measures, its statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri attached himself to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement from the top of the current US President and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June. At that time, Kim made a commitment to pursue “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump of North Korea promised security assurances.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up on nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not give in to calls for the release of strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
\"The United States insists on nuclear disarmament first, and step pressures with sanctions to force it to achieve its objectives, and even contest the declaration of the end of the war,\" Ri said.
\"In thinking that sanctions could get us down on our knees, it is the unrealistic hope of people who don't know us at all.
However, the problem is that further implementation of sanctions is still deepening our mistrust.\"
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US President highlighted at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jae In, who have taken place in the past five months, and added: “If we had talked about the problem of nuclear disarmament with South Korea and not the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have agreed to such a dead point.”
However, the tone of Rio's speech was quite different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the attack on the U.S. inland part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after \"Mr. Evil President\" Trump Kima labeled \"Racked Man\" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to \"fully destroy\" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures last year, but said that he still has a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no timeframe for this, saying: “It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The imposition of sanctions on the Security Council must continue without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
He met with Ri at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he declared that progress had been made and that North Korea had criticised him for several hours, saying that his demands were \"gangster\".
At a meeting with Moon during this month, North Korea committed itself to tear down the missile testing station and nuclear experiment infrastructure if the United States adopts \"suitable measures\".
Munu is expected to say that the \"usual measures\" meant the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course learning how to take enough time to rest
The aim of this year's new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With this course, they want to fight the growing mastic culture of the whole-night learning in which the powers are collected with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s finest university often do not know the basics of care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine sleeping at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that was his first type in the United States.
In order to conduct such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why am I only learning this now that I am in my last year?”
She said that no one had told her how important sleep is, and for the newspaper The Daily Telegraph said that this surprised him.
This year's course is about the key to good sleeping habits for study and sports success as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, says that they decided that such a course was the case when they found that there was a significant lack of sleep for students during the week.
One-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the door of the student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on the sports success and importance of the sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants find that long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of a student village with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
\"We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by smoking cigarettes,\" added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present when “sustainable lifelong learning”. He also adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, poses a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that sufficient quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. This can also avoid weight gain – the brain from lack of sleep goes into a way of hunger, making students constantly hungry.
19-year-old California Chemical and Physical Biology student Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professors' lectures.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct the course throughout the student village.
He hopes that in the next phase he will be able to ask the graduate students to complete a similar study programme before they enter the competition facility.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a sleep alarm as well as a wake. He also wants to warn them about the harmful effects of the “modern light” broadcast by electronic screens and LED-lights, as it can cause an imbalance of the circus rhythm, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with goal sink up Gerrard's team
Rangers defeated again: Dolly Menga in Livingston sentenced Steven Gerrard's declared team to defeat 1 :0.
The team from Ibrox had won its first guest victory since February at St Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team won the second win in 18 matches since his team led the Gerrard team, which left 8 points behind for the leading team of the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen type of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this the Rangers fell to a common place and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the goal difference the Hibernian team fell behind
The Rangers problem was not over yet. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when he was reportedly approached by an object from the city of the guest team fans.
Gerrard had eight shifts in the crew, which was easily overcome by Ayr and placed in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup Cup Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was holding on to the verified 1st Queen Livingston, who had taken the point of Hearts a week before, and he was no doubt impressed by the fact that his team was effectively neutralized by all the guest experiments.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start, when Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short pass, then went to Allan McGregor's goal, but he was an unsound and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs was then reached by Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game was more indicative of hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after the race with Steven Lawless, after 15 minutes of the match, there had to be a criminal shot, but Judge Steven Thomson's demands had been destroyed by Colombians in kali.
The Rangers managed to draw the first half only two shots at the goal, but not the head shot that Lassan Coulibaly sent to the goal, nor the little ball of Ovie Eyari, were no danger to Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Livingston’s opening goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everyone, but he was already fully earned because of his perseverance.
The Rangers couldn't cash in another Jacobs long-term extension.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher got the ball up to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi to present for the simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly with a wingman named Ryan Kent, who immediately appeared with the pods of Morelos, but Kelly ran effectively from his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with both Lithgow and Halkett taking care of several pods before the goal.
The Holt's team could have even increased leading towards the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralised Jacobs, and then Lithgow after a pass from the corner was inexact.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity to fire after contact with Jacobs at the end of the match, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
On September 30, 1882, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany, “Hans” Geiger, who later became world-renowned physics.
Geiger developed a method of perception and measurement of radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger counter.
This one became permanent in the scientific world, and he was also given his place in pop culture, like \"Bells of Coronado\" in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboy scientists:
Men: \"What the hell is this?\"
Rogers: »This is Geiger counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put your headphone on, you can hear the effect that the atoms have on the radioactivity in the materials.\"
Evans: “Madonca, now they really do!”
\"Hans\" Geiger died in 1945, just days before the 63rd birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify the attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and destroy the attack cells.
Treatment vaccine learns the immune system to identify the attack cells
This method includes the creation of immune cells in patients then modified in the laboratory
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer and then return to the patient.
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine who learns to recognise the attack cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the creation of immune cells in patients who change them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is typical of many forms of cancer, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer Research from Bethesde in Maryland said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “incentivises the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells in patients who are “teached” by cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West performed a prothrumpical point with a letter of MAGA on the drop.
The audience was not impressed
Kanye West was whistled at the studio of Saturday Night Live at a strange point, among which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that he would be in for the Presidential chair in 2020.
He was a member of the National Society of America, and he was a member of the National Society of the University of America.
“I often talk to a white person and say to me, “How can you like Trump, because he is a racist?”
\"Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,\" she said.
This time, the SNL broadcast began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor was fooled by the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission, who was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The video of West monologue was not broadcast, and it was loaded into social networks by comic Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was planning on making fun of me from West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some problems with captioning.
\"They went over the stage to get me.
They told me “don’t go on stage with this hat”.
I've been harassed!
And they say I am lost,\" said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the lost scene?” and added that it has to put on “Superman’s robe because this means that no one can direct me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.\"
His comments prepared the audience at least twice for whistle-blowers, and the members of the SNL team were obviously embarrassed, and someone said about Vanity: “There was death silence in the studio.”
West was invited last minute by a goat replacement for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
West caused a lot of wonders with the video for the song “I Love It”, where he wore the costume of the mineral water bottle Perrier brand.
Wesa supported Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, which tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: thank you for standing up for the paradise.”
Karen Hunter’s interview manager tweeted that the West was easy »that’s what it is, and that’s fine.
However, I will not reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or by supporting his “art”)), who, in my opinion, welcomes and extends the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
We also,\" she added.
Before the show, a rapper posted on Twitter that he changed his name and will now be \"a being formally known as Kanye West.\"
He's not the first musician to choose to change his name. He's already done this to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dog was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an artist, once known as Prince.

Star of the Game of thrones Kit Harrington stared sharply against toxic men.
Kit Harrington is known for his bravado of the match in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval coloured fantasy series Game of thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero says that the appearance of such roles on the screen often makes young boys feel that respect can only be earned by their hardness.
Kit told The Sunday Times that something went wrong, and wondered how he faced the problem of toxic masculinity during the movement #JajaTudi.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old player from the Rose Leslie Game admitted to having strong beliefs about this subject.
“I’m currently seriously asking myself where we made a mistake when there is a man” he said.
“What did we teach men during our childhood about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity of very male characters.
He continued: “What has been born and what has been learned?
What are they teaching us on television and on the streets, that young men feel they have to choose this particular side of men?
I think it's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change that?
Because obviously there was something wrong with young men.”
In his interview, he also said that after the end of the show next summer he would not participate in recording any prestory or continuation of the Game of thrones because he had “locked from the battlefields and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the lead role of True West Sam Shepherd's new performance, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that happened was the Game of the thrones, that he met his wife Rose in the recording.
“I met my wife because of this series, in a way she gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte in a fantasy series awarded to Emmy, the love favorite of Keith's character, Jon Snow.
A couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases reported from China
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to data from Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV from the Junan Province conference has been reduced to almost nothing.
However, in China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing annually by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV with sexual relations in the Chinese community LGBT is a very pressing problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still very high.
As conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women according to the results of research.
The disease is often tolerated due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of its efforts to solve the problem, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that the staff issued information on Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “theories of conspiracy”
On Saturday, U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters refused to accuse a member of her staff of publishing information on three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Democratic woman in Los Angeles confirmed that these accusations are coming from individuals and websites of the far right.
\"Lyings, lies and even more inconclusive lies,\" Waters wrote in a Twitter statement.
According to the information published, the domestic addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
These data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment against the Supreme Judge candidate, Brett Kanaugh.
There was a leak after the three senators had finished questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate state that through IP address it is possible to identify the source of publication, which should be linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information has been published by one of the staff, is still reported by Hill.
“These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” continues Waters.
\"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the removal of this data.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies.\"
Senator Waters' statement online quickly came across criticism, including by former White House Press representative Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of the wave of anger”, Fleischer wrote.
\"This could mean that it's not from the right congressional test.
When you accuse someone of something he has not done, he must not show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of who accused him.
It must remain calm.\"
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the mid-term elections, appeared via Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet had notified “the appropriate institutions and law enforcement bodies regarding these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for clues to Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and it also applies to reviving the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003, called Johnny English and continuing in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Is it gonna be fun satire about how shitty we are, a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English, with their eyes raised and unusual faces, is authorised to re-mix the hooks; its name indicates that it is a comical character created for cinematographic audiences in non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent, who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's claw and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics Games.
It is also based on the traveler and the international mystery man who was once played by Atkinson in the now forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind the real chaos.
The latest film presents one or two pleasant moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached in the helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were only a matter of his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and unduly unnecessary, especially since \"real\" films, like 007 or Mission impossible now without bad news offer comical elements.
It seems that humor is intended for children and not for so many grown-up viewers, and therefore for me the rejection of the events of Johnny English is not as innovative and oriented as Atkinson's silent sketches in the role of Mr Bean.
The constant subject now appears to be in serious trouble in Britain.
The online hacker infiltrated the web network of British top secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing major difficulties to a competent agent represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of breaking for the prime minister, the pop-up figure, who has already suffered a break due to political unattractiveness: Emma Thompson, although she has tried to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the scenario that could help her.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she has to choose one of the retired spies.
And this means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school who is informally teaching how to work undercover: here are screenplayers scored because English is conducting some sort of spy \"rock academy\".
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where he meets with a longtime associate of Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotype sports fan, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more problems in the name of her Majesty's secret service, meeting the fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenka.
In the meantime, the prime minister dangerously falls under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odysseys: dressed in waiters set up a fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak up on the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to learn about the inside of Walt's house, it manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy it reminds of a child film.
Very average.
Like in other Johnny English films, I can't help but think, is the British film Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifyes his talent?
Labour is denied to plan for the British for a four-day working week and would be paid for a five-day working week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day payment.
The client wants the savings created by companies for the revolution of artificial intelligence to flow to workers and give them an extra day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say that the idea corresponds to the party's economic plan and plans to put the country aside for workers.
Unions support the transition to four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from the emerging economy.
A source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve with the customer’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the four-week working week in its campaign in the general elections of 2017 supported the Green Party.
At present, this objective is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party representative said: “The four-week working week is not a party policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
In the shadows, Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to break the power of the \"unscrupulous directors\" and \"the storks\" in the utility companies.
The shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies may not regain the full share, since the Labour Party could, on the basis of alleged injustices, introduce “reductions”.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in the administrative committees and to introduce equity integration funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares in private enterprises to employees who would thus receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed on the show \"60 Minutes\" (\"60 Minutes\") whether or not their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, carried out by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of the Office of any Republican Senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In the interview they were broadcasting on Sunday, the correspondent gave \"60 Minutes\" to Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether or not the FBI could find anything to change its mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a fellow in South Carolina.
“I think, of course,” Kennedy said.
»I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him on this charge, I asked him, “Did you do it”?”
He was determined, unblemished, unsuspecting.\"
Graham's voice seems stuck in stone.
\"I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change,\" he said.
“I don’t know what happened to the Dr. Fords, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
»And none of those she named were able to confirm it
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don't see any new change.\"
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction at all times?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event involving a truly remarkable type of stars and having the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Great Trag of Central Park not only to enjoy performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizens' Festival is an expansion of the Global Citizens' Project, an international advocate group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or \"actions\", such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call, or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How, however, is the Global Citizen movement that remains 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to take action, or is this just another example of so-called “cliktivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or sharing a tweet?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011 more than 19 million of its supporters have been recorded for a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to accept commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In the early 2018 group stated that the fruit of its actions was 390 commitments and messages on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Diet (The Power of Nutrition), the partnership of investors and decision makers committed to helping children achieve their full potential\", which the Rwandans promised $35 million in aid in order to help eliminate savings once they received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
\"With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as yourself, we can put the social injustice of savings into historical archives,\" said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador to the Power of Food Partnership at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts were carried out by the Government, which called for improved mothers and children's diet, the government announced that it will co-financed the Power of Food project, which will achieve 5 million women and children through food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the web site, “Why do you think we can tackle extreme poverty,
movement Global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Among some performers who will perform this year's event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy – the U.S. interior ministry as a \"blockado\" of Russian energy exports
According to Washington Examiner's report, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said Washington could use a navy to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it is important to warn that the new energy markets are excused to invite a legitimate government.
\"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they market it in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,\" I said.
According to the functionary, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States can do this. The Navy ensures that our shipping routes are open and blocked if necessary, preventing Russian energy from entering the market,\" he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Energy Consumers Union event, a non-profit group called \"the voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
\"As far as Iran and Russia is concerned, the economic option is to have more or less fuel impact and to replace them,\" he said, noting Russia as a \"pony that knows one trick\", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when Trump's administration aims to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, where it is intended to push Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump Government, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to give up the \"inadequate\" Northern Stream 2 pipeline project, which is supposed to make it a \"talent\" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern Stream 2 pipeline is a USD 11 billion pipeline that is expected to double existing gas capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
Kremlin claims Washington strongly opposes the project for economic reasons only and that it is unfair competition.
\"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should have the right to select suppliers,\" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The involvement of the third country in our energy supply means a great problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will \"exactly study\" her candidacy at the election of the American President of 2020, a true Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would \"exactly study\" her candidacy for the American President after the mid-term elections.
At the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
\"It is time to go to Washington Women and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,\" The Hill reportedly said.
\"After November 6th, I will study my candidacy for the president carefully –
At a meeting in the city house, Warren was rewarded by President Donald Trump, as “this country is supposed to lead in the wrong direction –
\"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I am terribly worried,\" she said.
Warren and the candidate for Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh have repeatedly openly criticised Trump.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections -
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters feel that Warren should not compete for the presidency's position in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, the senator said that she should not run for president, eighty-five percent of the \"probably\" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that it has increased support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of respondents supporting it and 48 per cent opposed it.
The other high-ranking Democrats, which would be considered a candidate in the 2020 elections, are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the report of the Associated Press, he said he would make a formal decision by January.
At the meeting in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder at Track Palin
Trak Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after signing up for military service.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son is going through after his return links me with other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain extent of injury with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin’s arrest marked her son’s “slonica elephant” and said that her son and other war veterans were returning slightly changed, solidating, wondering where respect is for what the fellows and aircraft and all the other members of the army were offering to the State.”
Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasil, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstructing the application of domestic violence and possession of weapons in wine, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the police station in Wasilla.
18 federal states and Colombia District support the rejection of new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of a new American policy, which gives up the right to asylum to victims who escape violence against gangs or violence in the family.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district mentioned on Friday filled the lobby in order to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which was not published by the American Alliance for Civil Freedoms against federal policy, was not published.
She said that her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang”, abused her, but on July 20, her asylum claim was rejected.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum applications are coming in the United States, as countries that are constantly coping with the problems of gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy was repealed by the decision of the Immigrant Calls Committee, which made it possible for non-recorded immigrants to apply for asylum to flee from domestic violence.
In a statement Friday, District Attorney Columbia, General Karl Racine, said that the new policy \"dues decades of state, federal and international law\"
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and this principle is violated by such a prohibition” states the application to the court.
State prosecutors further stated in their request that the policy denying immigrants the right to enter harms the US economy, since they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and are \"providing the necessary workforce\"
State Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who flee domestic violence and gang violence in June.
\"Azil is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a single social group or political opinion,\" Sessions said in his publication of politics on June 11th.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors
The situation has been getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, as she comforted her hot boyfriend at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Pal.
\"Rescueers are constantly bringing in bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.\"
It seemed to be citizens returning to destroyed homes that were breaking through the wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered injury to his back and shoulder, were resting outside a military hospital in Paluj, where patients were treated outdoors because of continuous strong earthquake suns.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor of his apartment with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
\"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was pushed against the ruins of the walls,\" Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard the woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.\"
The American Ambassador accuses China's \"surgency\" with \"propaganda ads\"
One week after the publication of a four-party advertisement by the official Chinese newspaper in the American daily, praising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuses of the American press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the last Sunday's addition to Officer China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the American congressional elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Reuters reported that US federal officials had described Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US federal elections as a new phase in Washington's increasing efforts to pressure China.
Although the publication of ads to promote trade for foreign governments is common, Beijing and Washington are currently complicated in an ever-intensified trade war, in which they exchange shocks by introducing customs duties on import products.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's refund tariffs were expected to affect exporters in federal countries such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and formerly long-standing governor Iowe, chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
China has written Branstad in a column in Sunday's edition of Officer Des Moines Register, \"now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press –
“In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese Government took advantage of the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in Officer Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
\"On the other hand, in the stands with newspapers in Beijing, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens on the worrying Chinese economic routes, because the media is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not state which one.
Republicans lose election before interim elections with Kavanaugh break, warn analysts
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important republicans, who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh despite several charges of sexual assault, will be known in the coming interim elections with the loss of vote.
Emotions are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue to vote.
This cannot be returned,\" Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University University in Syracuse, said on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said that he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to appease angry voters.
\"The women won't forget what happened yesterday. They won't forget it tomorrow and not even November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang \"Newber is coming!\" when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate, when Republicans controlling the judicial committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported the news portal Mic.
\"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will exceed all limits,\" Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the press portal.
\"People say they are strong now, and that is true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among the undefined voters in the suburbs and the younger voters aged 18 to 29 who do not like the president, but do not vote often.”
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“It became a big mess for the GOP,” said former President of the Republican National Council, NBC News at the beginning of last week.
\"It is not only the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh oath; it is also a way that the Republicans deal with the Republicans and how they dealt with Ford,\" said Guy Cecil, director of the Priories USA, who supports the Democrats in the elections.
But the Americans seem somewhat divided between whether they believe more or not the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more support from the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in Ford's testimony or believe most, while 35 per cent said that they believe Kavanaugh either for sure or most.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believe that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying about it, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
Following FBA pressure, he is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, was reported by Officer The Guardian.
Last week, before the Senate's judicial council sworn to testify that when Kavanaugh was 17 years old, she was attacked in a winey state.
Ramirez claims that she was shown sexuality by the Supreme Court candidate when they were at the party together during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the World Web intends to launch a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the world web, opens up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupta’s purpose »to conquer the world –
“We decided to do it now”, he said of the new company.
»It is a historic moment –
The application uses the Solid platform technology that allows users to create a \"private storage\" or a \"pod\" storage facility
This may include contact details, job lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similarly, if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The particularity of the personal data storage facility is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
This is what the company calls “personal Data Reciprocating”
The Executive Director, John Bruce, says that the idea of a company to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills is to enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the safety platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Over this week, technology developers worldwide could use tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own decentralised applications.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not they could introduce a perfect change that could cancel all their business models overnight,
\"We do not ask for permission.
On Saturday’s publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee noted that the purpose of Inrupt was to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet by establishing a consortium of World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute Institute Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next period of the Internet,” said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: World War I winner of Victoria’s Cross · Global Voices
For the past 100 years, the city has celebrated the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the Church of England, which he won as a fighter in World War I.
Reverend Colonel Bernard Vann deserved his confession on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, and he never knew that he was given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, two of the colonel's grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that “is extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act in which he earned his medal.
According to Officer London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel of St. Quintino »through a very dense mist and under strong fires of battlefield and machinery -
Later, he headed towards the firing line and led the line forward with the \"greatest heroism\", and then attacked the machine gun himself and struck three members of the squad.
On 4 October 2018, Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something that I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility
With the brother, Dr. James Vann, after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt \"very honored to be able to participate in this parade\", and \"that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will say.\"
Inspired by mixed martial arts were kept up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they received Puyse Pepe.
Imagine: You've been up all night watching a fully sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 duels, including six on the main parquet, and was carried live in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to come to terms, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed to find that the transfer had been replaced by the cartoon Pujs Pep.
Marsikdo was not quite impressed, for he remained awake until the mornings due to a duel.
On Twitter, one of the enthusiasts described the picture as “a kind of sick joke ”
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Belator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
»Pussa Pepa. Yes-
The president of the Bellator Organisation, Scott Coker, said they are trying to adjust the schedule so that future viewers in the United Kingdom are included.
\"When I think about replaying, I think we could handle it,\" Coker said.
\"But then there is the sixth hour of the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages have been exchanged in the changeover and not everyone has been nice.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the government Regulation was the real reason.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will bear five fights – as usual. We have tried to offer more than expectations to fans and have lost our lives.
This is a very ungrateful situation.\"
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"less valuable\" about sexuality.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt less than anyone – but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that \"not every single person\" was aware when he entered high school.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said that gay rights were talked about to give others “hope”
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympic Games decreased.
The regular director of many years of broadcasts, Kirsty Young, was absent due to a month-long illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne's first show, said he felt \"less valuable\" than everyone else, because \"we didn't feel socially acceptable to have boyfriends and girls.\"
He said: “To date, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are the real thing that gives me strength and persistence to achieve success.
He wanted to prove that there was something, said he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic competitor has become a powerful advocate of LGBT-justices and has appeared twice this year in the Games of the Communities of Australia to invite countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy to be able to speak openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope ”
The three-time world champion said that a romance with a man – American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who met with him in 2013 – “surprised him –
Daley and the Oscar winner, aged 20, reported last year, but said that the age difference never meant a problem.
“When you experience so many young people” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic games and three years later his father died – he said, it is difficult to find someone the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, a couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that this changed his \"full view\"
“If you asked me last year, it would be all you would have to say that “I have to achieve the gold medal”, he said.
\"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.\"
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him: “This time you will not be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally had to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamt all my life – to dive in the Olympic Games before the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This inspired his first choice of songs – Proud musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and who still gives him skin.

♪ Unprepared Mickelson ♪ ♪ Saturday Ryder's Cup ♪
America's Phil Mickelson will be back on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, setting a record, but he'll have to go back in shape so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the bienal event for record 12, left Captain Furyk sitting on Saturday's four.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as often as it was for the United States, the five-time winner of the day spent part-time as a fan and partly in improving his game in order to repair what he weighted.
In view of the fact that, even at the height of the career, the criteria are not the most direct, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow field Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes the missing blows.
And if only the field wasn't scary enough, Mickelson would be dealing with the right winner of the British Open Francesco Molinarija, who was in the jump to victory in all four games this week to connect with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals four games less, had a good start, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, otherwise he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he has played today, he rubs me on the back and hugs me with his hand and says he will be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
\"He has great confidence in himself.
He is one of the famous and has made an enormous contribution to the teams in the past and this week too.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it worked, and we felt it had to be done.
He wants to play, just like everybody else.\"
Mickelson is going to break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup Cup Cup Cup.
I could then mark the conclusion of the Ryder Cup career, which never really coincided with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence in the team is also of some incomprehensible benefits.
\"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and he's great to have him in the team room,\" he explained.
“I think the young players were having fun when they got in a fight with him this week, which was fun to see.
Gives a lot more than just a game.«
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that a great advantage can soon come to an end
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that the important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the game of individuals in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into unpleasant driving.
In 1997, young Danec debuted at a competition in Valderrama, where the captain's side was Seve Ballesteros, had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the goal, it had a hair-only advantage, with a result of 141-2-131-2.
“Don’t forget that in Valderram we had a great advantage; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but barely,” said Björn (in picture) after visiting the Class of 2018 team, which won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and took to Le Golf National field with 106.
So the history of me and everyone on the team shows that the poker isn't over yet.
Play the full game tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
The game isn't over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this Cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
It has always said that I am focusing on 12 players on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Inspired by the game of his players on a tough field, Björn added: “I would never get ahead of myself here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow will be the front of the game of individuals, so it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, your golfers skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow you need to get the best out of you.
Now leave your partner behind, and he must bring out the best in him.\"
Unlike Björn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points from four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the revolutions in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed \"A Miracle in Medina\"
He replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, brought his players to the final day of the match.
\"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but we would like to start as quickly as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
Once this momentum has persistence, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We created a proper setup and put the boys in a way that we felt that we would do something magical tomorrow.\"
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to fight the battle and facing Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I have decided on this order, because I think it covers the entire schedule,” said Bjørn about the choice of individuals.
New German warship rescheduling
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be given in 2014 in order to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but because of damage to systems and rapidly increasing costs, local municipalities have reported.
The surrender of the ship \"Rheinland-Pfalz\", the leading ship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now being transferred to the first half of 2019, says Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel was to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is covered by worrying questions after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen class of frigate class.
It is expected that a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and some of the cover-up technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other significant features include longer gaps between maintenance – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the port of home for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that the top-notch military ships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence oversea, will become obsolete by the time the application begins, according to Commander Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared last year on the front page when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship's ship after delivery.
The reasons for recovery are few and the German audiences cited many key \"software and technical deficiencies\" that would make the warship useless if it were directed to the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will operate a crew with about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved to be very heavy, reducing its capacity and limiting the fleet's potential for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton ship \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" is supposed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem – including crew training.
This is expected to reach a dizzy of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) – from an initial of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Petersen Bartels, Head of the Committee on Defence of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy actually \"is running out of ships suitable for deployment\"
The employee said that the issue over time was tightened because the old ships were broken down and the replacement vessels were not guaranteed.
He regretted that no ship from Baden-Wuerttemberg could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new survey is being carried out in Scotland, where they strive to discover how bats use food to catch food.
They hope to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the survey, the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will be accompanied by small bats and small bats and brown-strength bats and obstetric bats at Inverewe Gardens estate in the Western Ross area.
Special recordings will be put in place at the key points of the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of calls from bats and what kind of things they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risks are also wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies and some types of chemical processing of construction materials, as well as cat attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
Night hunting makes it easier for the prey to work with their ears than their eyes.
For precise determination of errors and obstacles on the flight path, the sophisticated technique of echolocation is used.
The NTS, responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, checks on shelters and occasional rescues.
The organisation established the entire first and only Scottish reserve in Dumfrees and Galloway, especially for bats, at Threve's property.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says that their property is ideal territory.
\"We have an excellent area for bats in Treavo,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, bats are still very familiar, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to succeed.”
It stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats prior to the implementation of maintenance work on properties, as the possible inadvertent destruction of a single bat hospital can lead to death of up to 400 females and cubs, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, so they are prohibited from killing, harassing or disturbing, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Head of the Nipirus Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don’t know how well their populations behave.
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and lawyers prepare to press charges against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled rape charges as \"false news\" and said that they wanted to \"promotate themselves\" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with news of Der Spiegel, who announced the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus accused him of raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that she was then supposed to be paid $375.000 for her silence on the event.
In the address of 142 million followers in Instagram Live Video several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as \"false news\"
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news,\" the five-time gold ball winner said in the camera.
\"By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a lucky man and I wish everyone well,\" the player added smilingly.
Ronald's lawyers, according to Reuters, are preparing for the lawsuit of Der Spiegel on charges called \"unacceptable reporting on suspicions of private life\"
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “impotential damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years,”
The alleged incident was due in June 2009 at the Hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at the District Court of Clark in Nevada, she was supposed to return to the player's room after her meeting at the Mayor's nightclub with Ronald, and she was supposed to be anally raped there.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the said event and told her that he was “99 % good man”, who failed only in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations but described it as an agreement.
Majorga also claims that she was referring to the police and that she had taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital and later agreed on an extrajudicial settlement because she was “a terrible fear of revenge” and was concerned about “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that the settlement wants to be canceled, as the alleged event continues to have severe trauma.
Ronaldo was just before the transition from Real Madrid to Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer, according to an agreement worth $100 million, he moved to Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK would \"forever mourn\" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom \"would always regret it\" if, after Brexit, had lost the status of leading world car manufacturer, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that, without agreement, it was \"anxious\" that Toyota UK told BBC that the exit of Britain from the EU would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal”, said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory – which produces the Audiotina model Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 % of which exported them to the remaining European Union.
“I believe that if the UK left the European Union without agreement at the end of March, production in our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Kyoto’s managing director at Burnaston.
The concern about how the exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade without agreement has also been expressed by other UK car manufacturers, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit it would close its factory Mini in Oxford within a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of Brexit.
Toyotina’s production line operates at the right time, with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars arriving at the order every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to a disturbance at the borders of which the representatives of the industry say it could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota, in its factory in Derbyshire, could not store for more than one day of parts, said the company representatives, and therefore production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “exactly moderate to avoid such border checks”
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity”, said Today BBC Radio 4.
“Toyote not only data, but also other producers are that we absolutely have to be able to continue a highly successful supply chain set –
In the longer term, it noted that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the United Union Union Union Union Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job never recovers.
The government official said: “We must present a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union –
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, the White House says
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Prosecutor General, Rod Rosenstein, could be transferred by the White House on Sunday, due to the ongoing fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-election interference, the link between Trump associates and Russia, and the potential president's obstruction of judicial authority.
The question of whether Trump's envoy to the Attorney General will forgive himself and threaten Mueller's independence has been feeding Washington's rumor for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been talking about using a listening device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing a president based on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of reporting his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was announced on Thursday at the United Nations Conference in New York at that time.
Trump said that Rosenstein would not have been fired, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee, which was testified by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a uniting investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's vote.
Trump's press rep, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could have happened this week, and given everything else that goes on in the Supreme Court, it could have been postponed by another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed.\"
Some rapporteurs would object, and Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with reporters since September 10th.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of meetings is not to be attributed to the \"set\" of TV reporters, but said: \"I could not deny that they are standing\"
She then mentioned that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president has held more press conferences than any president before him” she said, adding, without a quote from the source: “We have looked at the numbers –
The meetings will still take place,\" Sanders said. \"If journalists at the President of the United States can turn their questions directly, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
This is what we are trying to make possible, and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest statesmen.
The independent press conferences are rare.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared in a sense of freeness and in part bizarrely in front of a crowd of journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to NHS Scotland on the fears associated with the Brexit
The EU Health Minister wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS that he would express the gratitude of the country and the desire to continue the work after the break.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the cost of applications for regulating the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the exit, as decisions came to light this fall.
However, the United Kingdom government has accelerated preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this must be a great deal of concern for all of you.
I therefore wish to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Members from all European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel completely at home in Scotland. We wish very much that you would stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
After the injury to the head in the Saturday defeat at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, Mike Organ reported on an emergency operation from The Tennessee newspaper.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury happened only a little before the halftime.
“He came to the edge of the playground and sort of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie on the edge of the playground with oxygen before they placed him on the stretcher and took him off the field for further inspection.
The employee of Tenneese State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie recovered from the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that \"the details of the type/range of the injury are not yet known\" and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tenneese State University for the first time after crossing the University of Illinois.
He had five strokes on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total number of hits in the season to 18 punches.
A higher charge will be charged to foreign customers when buying property in the UK
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increase in volume will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The treasurer expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of cash when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will be for the homeless, and will be reported today by Theresa May.
The move needs to be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure affordable housing and greater taxation of high-income persons.
The increased volume will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and the additional money will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The claim – which will be charged in addition to the current coefficient, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estates – could be no less than three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
According to estimates, non-nationals of the United Kingdom are expected to buy 13 per cent of newly built London's properties, resulting in price hikes and harder purchase of the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “the places of ghosts”, as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the hip to help young people buy their first home.
The large construction companies accused of price hikes by grabbing land which is actually not used, and Mrs Mayevo called on them to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to repair the British »state of shame”
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rents and the completion of forced migrations without mistakes.
It also wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime leadership to the restoration of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means correcting our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, to work and to create a life.
It cannot be right, however, that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign businesses, buying homes is as simple as for Garagen British citizens.
For too many people dreams of their own home are all too far away and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage the Scotland Club –
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his \"final goal\" once became the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-ranked.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after taking St Mirren back in the final season to the Scottish Championship.
\"I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I received a B cap and this was it,\" Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
\"But I grew up with the frequent observation of Scotland in Hamden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
I would only be offered this opportunity if I were successful in running a club.\"
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletic team, who had already rejected the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that he had not felt fear as heir to such large names.
“The success is measured to me by the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
According to the structure and capacity of this club, this club certainly belongs to the First League,\" he said.
“It’s not easy to travel there, but it would probably be considered a success only if the club could take you there again –
Ross did the manager's work only three years after his assistant was part of the Hearts coaching team at Dumbarton and he was 15 months old.
Alloi then helped prevent the decline in the third league, and St Mirren led from the edge of the outburst to the title of the championship championship in the next season.
Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real turning point”, he remembered the takeover of Allo.
\"I was truly convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous because I was doing well as an actor, doing relatively well, and I also achieved some greater successes.
But the game can become difficult.
Many things need to be faced every week.
In terms of stress and pressure at work, I still face it, but management just feels like the right thing for me.
I've always wanted to run a club, and I'm doing it now. In my entire adult life, I feel the most comfortable now.”

Research result: ideal beer time is Saturday at 17:30
The summer heat has increased the income of the hard-to-breaking British audiences, but the pressure has also increased on the chains of restaurants.
Public and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, the business adviser to the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The continued solar time and the participation of England in the world Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern than in June of the last month, when the public’s income increased by 2.8 percent, only that the restaurants were affected even more.
The drop in restaurant traffic increased by 1.8 per cent in June.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased in comparison to more than downsizing in restaurants.
As a result of solar weather, sales in pubs are also reduced, offering mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant operators.
I guess people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and food sales decreased by three per cent.”
Paul Newman of the group of leisure analysts and hospitality RSM said: \"These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
For sale on the catering market, the largest factors remain the time and impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall by 4.8 per cent per year-on-year will be particularly painful because of the constant cost pressures.
For food owners, the long hot summer could not come at a more bad time and only time will tell whether the recovery will be necessary to bring the more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.\"
The total sale in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of brands.

One of the five children has a secret account hidden from their parents on the social network
The study showed that one in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – have secret accounts on the social network hidden from parents and teachers
A poll among 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has strengthened fears about publishing sex related content
Twenty percent of students said they had a \"main\" account intended for parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have created an account hidden from their parents on social networks.
A poll among 20,000 students showed a rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has strengthened fears about publishing with the sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censorshiped \"main\" account that they show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
The mother, who happened to run into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that she invited the visitor’s daughter to be raped.
A survey conducted by the Digital Ageness UK network and the Conference of principals and principals (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 per cent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and half of them acknowledge that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are subjected to temptation and create a website where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the \"voice of athletes\" on the Scottish Committee on Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual general assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those directing sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are sure that athletics in Scotland would gain a great deal from her inclusion in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled that I will be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help in managing sports in Scotland –

On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me whether I would be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am conducting agile exercises!

An ad for a breast pump comparing the mother to cows divided online opinions
The company producing breast pumps divided the opinions by an ad comparing mothers with milk cows.
For the start of marketing “the first silent transmission pump” the Elvie consumer technique company published a provocative music video ad, which is supposed to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a hay-filled barn, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, but I’m drawing, there’s no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my seks, these are my tits.”
The collection continues: “Destruct, Exhaust, Feeding Baby, Exhaust, Exhaust, Compressing Breasts –
However, the ad published on Facebook's website has caused considerable discomfort online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said he joked at the expense of the \"trous\" of the dairy industry.
\"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also get pregnant and get pregnant to produce milk, but they steal their babies in the first days after the roll,\" she wrote.
Elvie’s chest pump is sensibly fit into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
The second commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their children?\"
Someone else added: “Advertisely unfeeling -
Others praised, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song “for a dead joke”
\"This seems a genius idea.
I'd buy it, too, if you'd still breast-feed it.
Drawing made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was a bit crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
This is a genius product,\" wrote another.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at moms who exhaust their milk (often in the workplace or the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.\"
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fit into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold children and even outdoor activities during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in mothers, commented. »Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a bold and provocative presentation –
With the pull of a parallel between women who draw milk, and cows' milkies, we wanted to put into the spotlight the drawing of milk and all its challenges, and in the fun way women can connect, show an amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first case when the Elvie pump arrived on the front page.
During the London Week of Fashion, the mother of two children on a model track walked for the designer Marta Jakubowski when she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrants children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detainees' children has risen greatly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rough rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors are unconformed migrants, so they are afraid that their chances of staying in the country would be threatened by the child’s request.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities reported that potential sponsors and other family household members would have to place fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had applied for a sponsorship of unmanned minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the people arrested had no prior criminal record.
\"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or household sponsor members are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to search these individuals,\" said Mr. Albence.
In order to address children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, workers in the shelter said.
Many will show up with a video conference call, not personally to defend themselves against an immigration judge.
Those who are not entitled to aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, following statements by workers in shelters and reports in the system in recent months.
The advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, e.g. Tornill, where signs of child distress due to their size are likely to remain undetected.
They added that the transfer of children to the city of tents, without emotionally preparing them or giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends, could complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria urges the American, French and Turkish \"ocupation forces\" to withdraw immediately
In the address of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, even if war has already been going on in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also performs the tasks of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegally under the threat of fighting terrorism, and that \"they will also be treated accordingly\"
\"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,\" the assembly said.
Moualem said that the \"war against terrorism\" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people had to leave their homes, \"almost finished\".
He said that Damascus would continue to \"fear this sacred battle until we cleanse the Syrian territory\" of both terrorist groups and \"any illegal foreign presence\".
In Syria, the United Nations have about 2,000 soldiers, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for them were appropriate for return, and accused some of the Western states of \"expanding unreasonable fears\" that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
\"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their return,\" he said.
\"They are changing the political issue, which should be an exclusive humanitarian issue,
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive renewed funds until Assad and the opposition reach an end of the war agreement.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important station of rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on a province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a \"clear deadline\" and expressed hope that the military intervention will be directed against the Jihadist, including fighters from Fronta Nusra, associated with Al-Qaeda, who will be \"rooted\".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of the new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to prepare the post-war constitution for Syria and press the way to the elections.
Moualem defined the terms of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited \"to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution\", and warned against interference.
Why will Trump reach second term
After this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-elections unless, as he is likely to hope, many liberal viewers, his presidency will prematurely end up with an interview and a scandal.
Which would be without a doubt the most dramatic finale of the presidency at any time –
So far, no signs of tired viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings at the time of maximum viewing have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's ratings almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News canal has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of the highest ratings, which according to Nielsen more than four years ago, when it had 1.7 million, the show \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" on MSNBC channel reached the maximum number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers with night important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it is something that we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designated Survivor”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned writer of comedy and author of the book »Only funny parts: and some hard truths about howling in the Club of Hollywood Boys« offers a different explanation.
Remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” said Mrs. Scovell.
It's fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wad case, whether immigration families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, the six-hour view of the round table of experts discussing the use of the source \"from the deep background\" for the book \"Streh\" Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of the Noah's Leather jackets (\"the garment, thickly subjected to inflation\", said Officer The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, Khm, anatomy.

There was no way he could tear himself away, even when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the air.
“I recall that at that time we created all these crazy shows and people said, “This is the end of Western civilization”, Mr Fleiss told me.

The external money is stacked in preparation for the most pressing interim parliamentary elections
Not surprisingly, in the 17th Pennsylvania district, there is a flood of money as two candidates found themselves in the race for the same seat due to the redecoration of the convention districts.
This recently divided suburbs of Pittsburgh are home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn new when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge in January ruled that the old districts had been anti-consistently painted in favour of the Republicans.
The match in the new 17th district has touched the fight for funding the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRC).
Lamb became the famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March special elections for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a slight advantage.
In the United States, sanctions against Salvador were considered for Chinese support and then withdrawn.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and wanted to have one in Panama until the partners expelled the management of the Trump organization.
The officials of the Foreign Ministry have decided to recall the US leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama are \"strength a decision to end the recognition of Taiwan\", said Heather Nauert, the ministry's representative at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered with regard to Salvador, which was estimated to receive USD 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the restriction of financial assistance and a targeted visa restriction, would have seriously affected the Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, however, the top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus completing their thinking on fines for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of speaking to the participants of the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance attributed by the US government to the meeting, the diplomats added.
Three US envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss them on the condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government who also spoke about it on condition of anonymity.
Historic comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judicial authority, which is now very much evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller was also supposed to point the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before this authority and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to meet his constituents again.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not want to argue that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it of its peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long a struggle may be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to strike against Hitler if the West had rebelled against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of worship that followed.
On such breakages, it changes the course of history and promotes or inhibits the impregnable march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with more of these fractures right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein, in the year since this officer reported that he had proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inadequacy of this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report by Officer The Times is incorrect.
\"How will we respond if the requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh will not be comprehensive or fair or if he will be appointed Supreme Judge despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the congress that will demand Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If these tests fail, there will be a long winter democracy.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and told me 60 years later to light the sabbath candles on the swastika table.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with such heritage?\"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that the victory over the Austrians will put them in a convincing position at the beginning of this month's G- League qualification.
The damage to the knee to the chain player Graham Dorrans prevented him from showing up for the first time in the season before the 2-2 against Villarrreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a bounce for greater achievements.
“This was the point we deserved because Villarreal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
\"We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take a point.
We may end up winning, but in general, rummy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am confident with a lot of us that we can work hard and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can move on now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.\"
Bad sleep due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear picture of how they should be cared for, few family members talk about it.
Half of the surveyers of the Nationwida insurance company said that they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talk to their children about it.
\"People want to be cared for by a family member, but do not bother to talk about it,\" said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwida Life Insurance Sector.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare a family for you if you do not discuss this with her in due time.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance by own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a healthcare agent by identifying a trusted person who will control your healthcare and ensure that professionals take into account your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also authorising a person for his finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.

An earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, while the number of victims was expected to increase further.
In the event of suspended communications, the rescue workers from Donggala regency, the area north of Palujo, which is nearer the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake, could not obtain any information.
After the earthquake, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Some key information about Palu and Donggala in Sulavezi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavezi, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavezi and is estimated to have 379.800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches over 300 km (180 km) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulavezi.
The Regency, the administrative unit under the province, was estimated to have 229,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulave are aquaculture and farming, in particular in the central region of Donggal.
In the province, the mining of nickel, which is mostly carried out in Morvali, is also an important activity on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
Palu and Donggalo reportedly have suffered multiple tsunami damage to the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also hit North Donggala and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake - active Pacific ring of fire, which is why earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: The major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesia-based Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Assessment, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: The type of powerful earthquakes was affected by Western Sumatro late in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The Magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coastline and caused the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of the Magnitude 7.6 occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Magnitude earthquake 7.5 has affected one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed the dozens of villages and caused death of about 300 people.
2016: The swimming earthquake affected the regency of Pidia Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami didn't go off, but the fallen buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: The major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily kept thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the oldest son of the former governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
29-year-olds from Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took her phone out of hand.
The Palina has been detained at the Mat-Su Predicate Foundation and is in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the KTUU TV network reported.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he spoke of the \"unguilty security\" when asked about the opposition, the network reported.
The Palin has charged three Class A offenses, which means they could have closed him up to one year and fined him with a fine of USD 250,000.
He was also charged with a single Class B offence punishable from one day in prison and fines of USD 2000.
The palace of crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of interfering with the reporting of domestic violence, and of possession of alcoholic weapons in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by the Veterans in 2016 when she linked the violent behavior of her son to a post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
It was a 7.5-munnitude earthquake that triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off and the number of deaths is expected to increase further in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just outside central Sulavezi, located north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were held at the festival on the beach in Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a terrorist suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death sentence for Cyful Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York where eight people have died, a rare sentence that has not been committed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious physical injury, it is written in the notice of the death penalty application lodged in the South York district.
According to a court case, any of the charges may be caused by the death penalty.
For several weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury of Saipov informed the indictment in 22 points, including eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was called for \"significant planning and intent\", the prosecutors said, describing Saip's manner as \"student, cruel and reproved.\"
»Sayfulo Habibulavic Saipov caused damage, damage to and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erriji, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,\" was written in the note of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the South District ordered the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers and finally turned his sentence into a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty in the city of New York was last given in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were killed on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, in the days and months following the attack, showed no regret, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, he told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he saw on his phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that he requested the deployment of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On the 22 counts of prosecution, he's found himself guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
\"Let us note that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering of these events,\" Patton said.
Prior to this, Saip's task force had asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
For the Brexit negotiations, the official Member should be responsible for NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage, today, promised to “mobilize the human army ” during a protest at the Torian Conference.
The former leader, Ukipa, said that the Eurosceptics policy should be \"feeling hot\" when one of Theresa May's own Members suggested that it be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
At a campaign in Birmingham, Conservative Member Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would be “out by now” if he were the secretary of the Brexit, Mr Farage.
However, the challenge facing Ms. Mayeva in coordinating their deeply divided species has been highlighted by the Tories, who favoured the cancellation of the Brexit, who joined a separate protest against the city's peaches.
The Prime Minister is working hard to maintain her track plan during the attacks by the Brexitists, the opponents of the Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva will try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and laburists to choose between their package and “Choose”
Mr. Bone is at a convention of Leave Mens Leave (Department means leaving) in Solihul that »wants to get rid of Chequers –
He said that we should appoint Mr. Farage as his opponent and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge, they would have been out by now,\" he said.
This MEP from Wellingborough added: “I will support the peach, but we have to get rid of Chequers –
He described his opposition to the EU as saying: “In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country.\"
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: \"The thought of the British having changed their minds and wanting to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic,
At the meeting there was also a Tory Brexitar, Andrea Yankees, who told the rapporteurs: “I’m simply saying: “The Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our party and our activists who are active in the streets and lead us to the election at all.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a communication dedicated to Ms. Mayeva, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises –
Mr Farage said at the meeting that policies need to be given a \"feeling hot\" if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,\" he said.
“They’re trying to issue a Brexit, and today we are gathered together to tell them: “We will not allow this.”
In his message, the enthusiastic crowd added: “I want you to feel the heat of our political class, which is on the verge of the issue of the Brexit, ”
“We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has given us the victory at the Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom,
In the meantime, the remainers walked through Birmingham, where they had a two - hour meeting at the city center.
A handful of activists waved the flags of the Tories against the Brexit after setting up the group this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis has mocked conservatives for safety problems when using the client application after the conference was opened.
\"These are people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for a no-stop border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,\" he added.
\"This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good peach,\" he added.
Warren’s possible draw to the position of President »will be carefully examined –
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that \"co-operation in the race for the presidency will be carefully studied\" after the November elections.
The Journal of The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation in order to cope with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to compete for the post of president.
Warren replied that it is time that \"women in Washington hate women and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top\"
Arrested after the death of LSU Sims' shooting player
In the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Saturday, police reported that they arrested a suspect on Friday for the shooting of LSU Wayd Sims' basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Station reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at the 11th hour press conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and requested help in identifying the man on the tape.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the South University campus.
\"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot to the head and therefore finally died,\" Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, reported the 247sports network.
Wade got involved in protecting his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene of the incident that he had the weapon and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, 198-centimetre young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the final season with 10 beginnings, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps on the game.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached World Champion, and his team ordered him to let Sebastian Vettle win
On Saturday, the moment Walteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton became clear that “the Mercedes team will have a major impact on the race”
Bottas began well at the start and almost left Hamilton on dry ground when defending his position in the first two turns and inviting Vettla to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes led him into the boxing later and left him behind Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari driver leaves the inside open and risks he will be left behind after two moves for defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in seventh place.
He then drove most of the race without changing tires, as he intended to run a fast finish, run over the Chimija Raikkonen and occupy the fourth.
He was finally taken to boxing in the 44th round, but he was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight circles, so the fourth city was taken by Raikkonen.
It's a hard day, because Walteri drove fantastically all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me by.
The team has done an extraordinary job to achieve the first and second place,\" Hamilton said.
That was a really bad physical rumor.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein at Saturday's meeting because of her insistence that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who accused her of sexual assault.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s investigative committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “a wicked, corrupt and false ”
\"The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and false,\" he said.
“When you look at the publications and the disclosures, people say, “No, I didn’t do that”
I didn't do it.\"
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer ... you have revealed a document – oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it.”
Okay, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... No, we did not,\" added the senator's impression.
Ford sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was revealed at the beginning of September – but Feinstein denied that it had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose her letters,” The Hill Feinstein reported to the Commission.
\"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential as she asked.
But her denial obviously did not match the president who said at the meeting Saturday night: “I tell you, it was really a bad rumor of the body.
It may not be, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.\"
In defending the Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the President suggested that Democrats abuse charges for their own purposes.
\"They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
You have seen wickedness, abomination, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to run to get to power and control,\" the president said after reporting on the mediaite website.

Air traffic controller has made it possible to escape from earthquake by killing hundreds of people on board
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero after sacrificing their lives so that a plane with hundreds of people could fly safely.
In Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, followed by the tsunami, over 800 people died, and many were missing.
The area continues to be shaken by powerful earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the town of Pal.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in a heavily-saving control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could have taken off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was coming down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart is in the market when we hear it”, he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as the Agency said that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
\"The number of dead should have increased even further because there were numerous bodies under the ruins, but many could not achieve,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The palace, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, devastated waves up to six metres high.
Military and commercial planes bring assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: \"Every minute, a rescue vehicle brings the bodies.
We're short of clean water.
Minimarkets are everywhere.«
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: \"The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy which can become much worse.”
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Pal and urged the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?« According to CNN.
In Indonesia, earthquakes in Lombok, which left over 550 people dead at the beginning of this year.
Micro-Nesian plane crash: Air Niugini Airport now says that one person is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that was operating the flight that crashed into the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia now says that one person was missing after they initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the diving plane.
Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
In the airline, they said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not respond immediately to a call for more information on a passenger such as his age or nationality.
The local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that they had taken seven people to the hospital.
The airline said that there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just outside the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went very low.
“This is extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that, along with other passengers, he was able to break through the range of moving water to emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said that the stewardess started a panic and cried out, but he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors were also helping to repair the pier nearby, helping themselves using an inflatable boat that carried people to land before the plane sank to about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last two decades in aviation accidents in Papua-New Guinea, but this is the first accident that occurred to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was received from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, was reported by Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that “he lied because he was [my] truck in Nashville ”
The other inconsistency was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The cell phone records indicate that she and I only met for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defence is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that a jury would be judged later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
The hippo trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling up its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hiphop has been removed from its initial political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and the Commons have recently experienced a resurgence with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?!
New York nanny is suing a couple because they fired her for \"racist\" message
The New York nanny is suing a couple because she was discriminated against after receiving a missent message from her mother, who complained that \"there is another black woman\"
A couple denying the racist behavior and compared the action to “excretion”
In 2016, Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived, found that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEE ONE BLACK” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, he was sent twice by Mrs. Maurice.
After she found out that Plasco-Flaxman, who felt \"comfortable\", Ms. Maurice, fired, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, wanted to hire a Filipinka, was reported by the Officer of the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now demanding compensation from a couple in court of USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the performance of the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, no such thing is done,” she said about the Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that the dismissal of Maurice was reasonable because they feared that they could no longer trust her after the insult.
\"Her wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
Not even a racist.
We are not a racist,\" the man Joel Plasco told us about the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone whom you were rude to even if this had happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on. \"
Compared to the lawsuit with “immigration”, Plasco said that his wife had a baby only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“You’re going to act like that?
This is not very nice,\" added the investment banker.
Although court proceedings are pending, the Court of Public Opinion on Social Networks was quickly condemned by its behaviour and manner of thinking.
The publishers of the story of the Paddington Bear feared that readers would not associate themselves with a speaking bear revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It was difficult to put into the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It's very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an exceptional hit.\"
She said that at first her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired to write children’s books on little bear toys, was bitter when she refused her work, she added that after his death last year, she was the 60th anniversary of the book »Grenko-Sugar –
With regard to the Paddington bear, which she described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that the father was very proud of his final success.
\"There was a quiet man who did not like to boast,\" she said.
“But since Paddington's bear was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of him even if you are not really doing it yourself.
I believe that Paddington's bear had a similar view of success.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the Paddington bear itself.\"
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the time of the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors in vain sought to preserve her life.
“Hope called regularly to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I got a call from Nad, and he told me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to keep on drawing her heart have slowly drained and left her system.
She's been dying for some time, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position around my family and people.
I really had to hold on.\"
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperous, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, not aware of the trials she was undergoing.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head removed, and all the time I had tears on my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.\"
Grieved female glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one for suicide try to turn others away from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valian Bridge glue posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want for any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydia, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
\"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room.\"
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place –
In 2014 he was Tyler's brother, 11 years old, the one who found a relative when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will be triggered –
Mrs. Davis has made posters to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to even if it's a friend.
Do not sit in silence – you must talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
\"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened presents, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was severe trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She's torn us apart.
But we must continue and fight.\"

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of an FBI investigation in the air
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, this might make us more united,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he fears that the world is afraid that because of the contaminating party impasse “disciplined”.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is the result of the time during which the investigation would take place.
By the mid-term elections of November 6th, it is only five weeks – if, as expected, the Republicans are to cut off badly, they will be greatly weakened by trying to elect a wanted man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators several times to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, who was presented by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI agency prepares the report?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring a breakthrough from the Supreme Court and election to Mike Pence.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MEP said.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1127 people had fled last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the price required by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not yet made a public comment.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed.
Most of them are fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarised area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denucleisation negotiations.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, on the other hand, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho has given US sanctions a standstill ever since.
\"Without confidence from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,\" Mr Ri said in his address of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi labeled Brett Kavanaugh as a \"hysteric\" and says he's not fit for a job in the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives has appointed Bret Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate as a \"hysterical\" and said she is technically unfit for a service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosieva said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of another, as if a woman were acting like this, to be referred to as “hysterical”, Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate’s investigative Commission commented on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh was furiously denying the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost cry out and choked on his family and high school years.
He explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and accused himself of \"grously and coordinated muddy\", organised by liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosiev said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed Supreme Judge because it showed that he was partial to the Democrats.
\"I believe that with such statements and the way Clinton and the Democrats took a stand, he discredited himself,\" she said.
Pelosi's question is whether she will try to bring a constitutional accusation against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats will get a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
\"I will say this – if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now,\" Pelosiev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the federal appeals court in Washington.
Pelosieva said that she was concerned as a Democratic with any decision made by Kavanaugh against the Law on Available Health Care or the Roe v. Wad case, as it was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided whether or not he would invalidate some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“Now is not the time to go hysterical, biased person to court and expect us to say “Isn’t that wonderful?” Pelosiev said.
And women need to get a hold of him.
It's a righteous outburst, after months and years of bursting anger, and it can't express it without crying.
“We do, when we are angry,” Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
“This doesn’t seem very rare to me,
She continued: “A woman who was somewhere crying, who also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique when she got angry and started crying, said to the person she was talking to, “I may feel sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was great.\"
Tears are partly allowed as an anger exit because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office where men were dominated, and I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, is an event when I was grabbed by an older woman by the neck – a cold leader who was always a little afraid that dragged me to the staircase.
\"Never let them see you cry,\" she said.
\"They won't understand that you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad that they've beaten you.\"
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a raft in a boat called Monkey Business and he had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply depressed and found there was no reason why she couldn't run for president alone.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
\"Seven other candidates participated in the competition, and another was the last thing that was needed at that time.
Someone named the match “Snow and Seven Sticks”.”
As the last campaign joined, it fell behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the competition unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $ 1000, gave her only USD 250.
“Do they think I'll get a discount?” she wondered.
When she told her not to start an official campaign, she was moved to feel grateful for the people who supported her, the dissatisfied with a system that made it so difficult to raise money and direct to voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexism, so that she started to choke.
\"We would think I had a nervous breakdown,\" Mrs. Schroeder mentioned the media reactions.
\"We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
“Is she crying?””
How the war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle has not been over for a long time, experts say that the gap between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has often avenged itself with equivalent reimbursement measures, with tariffs of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent on US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the world's second largest economy, has committed itself to moving its eye around with the United States, and is likely to blink soon.
In order for Washington to give in, China should agree to its demands, but the public removal of the United States of America for Chinese President Shi Genping would be too embarrassing.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can make the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence on the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shock in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional associate who focuses on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” for refugee returns, true Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in the restoration of a country devastated in more than seven years of war.
In the address of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
\"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer due to the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal status.
All conditions are now met for refugees to return voluntarily to the country, who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated state.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsored by rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris in France with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and the Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Björn reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems in most of the championships, got into the water at the 16th hole in a pair of three games at his initial hit, which is why he had to hand the game over to Francesca Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the circles and became one of four players who had reached 5-0-0 at any time since the beginning of the championship in the current form in 1979.
By 5 and 4 Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-class player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-ranked actor, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup last time.
The Veteran of the Eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player at the championship of all time.
\"I don't normally cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the Cup again.
It is a team, and I am really glad that I could help,\" Garcia said emotionally after European victory.
He's handing it over to his cousin John Ram, who beat the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday 2 and 1 in the games of individuals.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France to play, and now has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
All week long, the U.S. team has worked very hard to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played golf at the high level all the time.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said: “I am so proud of these boys, they fought.
We pushed Europe a little bit in the morning.
We failed.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, work together with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
A hat down.
They've outplayed us.\"
