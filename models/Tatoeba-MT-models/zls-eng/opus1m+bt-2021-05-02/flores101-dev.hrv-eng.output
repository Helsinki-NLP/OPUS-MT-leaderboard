Stars emit light and heat because of the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are combined (or melted) into heavier elements.
Scientists work to create reactors that can create energy in the same way.
However, the problem is difficult to find a solution and it will be many years before useful fusion reactors are built.
The steel needle floats on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
The surface tensions come because the molecules of water on the surface draw strongly to each other, more than they are attracted to the air molecules above.
The water molecules form an invisible wave on the surface of water that allows things like a needle to float on water.
The blade on modern skates has a double edge with a conical depth between. Two edges allow better ice grips, even when leaning.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly covered, when the blade leans on one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curved.
The slider turns over for that. If the sliders lean to the right, the slider turns to the right, and if they lean left, it turns to the left.
In order to return to the previous level of energy, they need to get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
\"This is what they do with a small particle of light called \"foton\"
\"Scientists call this process a \"stimulated radiation emissions – – because bright light stimulates atoms, causing photons of light to appear, and light is a kind of radiation –
The next image shows atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are much smaller in reality than in the picture.
The photons are even smaller than the substances that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of working the glow thread in the light bulb eventually burns and the light bulb doesn't work anymore.
Then it is important to replace the light bulb. It is important to be careful when replacing the light bulb.
First of all, a light-body switch should be turned off or the cable unbuttoned.
That's because the current that affects the throat at the place where the metal light can hit a heavy current if you touch the inside of the throat or the metal bottom of the light bulb while part of the bulb is still in your throat.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart whose role is to pump blood.
The blood from the heart flows with a tube called the arteries and returns to the heart of the tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of the triceratops could have crushed not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that triceratops ate cicadas, a kind of plant that was common in Creda.
Those plants look like tiny palm trees with a tree full of sharp barbed leaves.
Triceratops may have used a strong beak to rip off leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly toxic and are unlikely to have been eaten by dinosaurs, although today sloths and other animals like parrots can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you were standing on the surface of the moon Io, you'd weigh less than on Earth.
The person with 90 kg (200 pounds) on Earth would have 16 kg (36 pounds) on the ground. So gravity is weaker than on Earth.
The sun has no crust on which it can stand like the earth. The sun is made of gases, fire, and plasma.
Gas is getting rarer as you move away from the center of the sun.
\"The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called a photosphere, which means \"light ball.\"
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope and observed that Venus has stages just like the moon.
The changes occur because only the side of Venus (or the moon) is lit. Venus's changes are in addition to Kopernik's theory that planets are moving around the sun.
Then a few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks spotted Venus's transit.
England entered a long period of peace after the conquest of Danelawa.

When the fight for France ended, Germany began preparations for an attack on Britain.
\"The German operation called the codex \"operation Sea Lion – most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk so the army was quite weak.\"
\"But the Royal Navy was stronger than the German ('Kriegsmarine') and could destroy any fleet that would invade the English channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were located near possible routes of attack because the admirals feared the ships would sink in a German air strike.
\"Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was mostly the younger brother – Germany and Japan –
She had a weaker army and a navy, although four new ships were built just before the war started.
To capture those countries, the Italian main objective was to have troops sailing the Mediterranean and conquer Africa.
In order to do that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.
As for Japan, it's an island country, just like Great Britain.
The submarines are designed to move and longer hold underwater.
The submarines were used in World War I and II, and they were very slow then, and they had limited range of fire.
At the beginning of the war, the vessels were mostly over the surface of the sea, but as the radar developed and became more precise, the submarines were forced to go below the surface in order not to be seen.
The German submarines were known as the U-boot.
Because of their success with submarines, it is not desirable for the Germans to have large numbers of submarines in the postwar period.
\"Yes! King Tutankamon, sometimes called the \"King Tut\" or \"the boy-king\" - is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times,

Another famous Greek is a mathematician of Pythagoras, who is best known for his familiar lesson on the relations of the pages of a rectangular triangle.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most common language in the world.
The number of original speakers varies depending on whether or not they are closely related dialects.
It is estimated that there are 340 to 500 million speakers, and 800 million people understand language.
Hindish and Urdu have a similar dictionary, but a different letter. In everyday speakers of both languages can usually agree.
Northern Estonia was under Germany's great cultural influence around the 15th century.
Certain German monks wanted to draw God closer to the indigenous population, so they invented Estonian literature.
“He based himself on the German alphabet, and one sign has been added,” ‘

The creation of interactive media requires the usual and traditional skills, as well as tools that are mastered in interactive settings (inspired drawings, editing of audio records and videos, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design implies reviewing its own assumptions about media content creation and the exercise of thinking in non-linear manner.
Interactive design requires that parts of the project are connected to each other, but also make sense on their own.
The lack of zoom lens lies in that the complexity of the focus and the number of objective elements is necessary for the range of the rpm much greater than that of the basic lenses.
This is no longer a problem because manufacturers have more standards in the production of lenses.
This made it possible to use the lens to increase image design, the quality of which can be compared to those achieved with fixed rpm.
Another lack of zoom-in lens is the largest diameter (speed) of lenses is usually lower.
Therefore, cheap zoom lens is difficult to use in light-free conditions.
One of the most common problems with trying to convert film to DVD format is overscanning.
Most TVs are designed to satisfy the general population.
That's why everything you're watching on TV has cut top, bottom and side edges.
It's done to cover the whole screen and it's called overlapping.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, its edges will probably be cut off, and if the subtitles were too low, they won't be fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castle was long occupied by the imagination and enchanted with scenes of fighting, banquets and knighthood from the legend of Arthur.
Even as you are standing in the middle of thousands of years of ruins, you can easily imagine the sounds and smells of past-time battles and almost hear the bludgeoning of the hooves on the caldres and feel the fear rising from underground dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were the castles even built? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is more well-founded house than a real castle, which is typical for that period.
Large glass windows and thin walls couldn't resist a decisive attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, the country was relatively peaceful and should have been protected only from small groups of wandering thugs.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain national sovereignty in all European countries.
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation becoming too powerful and therefore, state governments often changed allies to maintain balance.
The war for Spanish heritage was the first war that primarily concerned the balance of power.
This was an important turning point because European forces were no longer excused to be religious wars, so the Thirty Years ’ War will be the last so-called religious war.
Artemidine temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C. due to the arson committed by Herostat.
According to the story, he was willing to do anything to make himself famous. The Ephesians were so angry that they ordered Herostrat's name never to be written down.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded the name and so we know today. The temple was destroyed the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander as King offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was rejected, and after Alexander died, the temple was restored to 333 B.C.

Civilisation in the Indus Valley belonged to the bronze age and lived in the northwest Indian sub-continent, involving most modern Pakistan and certain areas in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization, as her only name tells her, was rising in the valley of the Indus River.
However, some scholars claim that civilization should be called Ind-Saravati because it existed in the bay of the now dried river Saraswati. Some call it the Harappa civilization of Harappa, the first excavation in the 1920s.
Militarianism of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medicine.
Emperor August began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical force to use after the battle.
The surgeons knew about various sedatives such as morphine from the extract of poppy seeds and scopolamine from the pumpkin seeds.
They mastered the method of amputation that saved the lives of gangrene sufferers, and they also used bindings and artery clamps to stop blood flow.
During the centuries in the Roman Empire, great discoveries in the field of medicine took place and knowledge that we are familiar with today was formed.
Pureland origami style is an origami that is allowed to create at the same time only one set, more complex sets such as upside-down sets are not allowed, and all sets must be straight.
This technique was developed by John Smith in the '70s to help the inexperienced puzzlers or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop early awareness of race and racial stereotypes, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children belonging to a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, do not achieve good academic results usually discount at school when they find out about a stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
Web sites have attracted a lot of attention, especially in education systems.
Such websites also have positive pages, including the ease of placing a class page, which may include blogs, videos, photos and other elements.
It is easy to access the site via a web address, so it is easier for students who have difficulty using a keyboard or spell to remember and enter it into the browser.
The page is easy to adjust for easier reading and it is possible to reduce or increase color quantities.
“A disorder lacks attention –” is a neurological syndrome defined by classic triad symptoms involving impulseness, carelessness and hyperactivity or excess energy – –
“It’s not the inability of learning, it’s the problems of learning. ” “It’s 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps 2 million American children. ”
Children with attention deficit disorders find it difficult to focus on things like school tasks, but they can concentrate on what gives them pleasure, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
“These children often get into trouble because they ‘indulg in risky behaviors, quarrel and challenge authority – in order to stimulate their brains, which cannot be stimulated by the usual methods.
ADD affects peer relationships because other children cannot understand why children with ADD behave in a certain way or why they write in a certain way, or that their degree of maturity is different from others.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in the above - described way, the basic level of knowledge has changed.
Access to information was different. No pressure on individual memory was exerted, but focus was more focused on text memory abilities.
Renaissance has, in fact, introduced a significant change in access to learning and knowledge dissemination.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use their hands to move, rely or swing through tree trees.
The chimpanzees have palms and feet of similar size and length, resulting from the use of palms for carrying weight when walking with their wrists.
The human arm is shorter than the leg and has straighter articles.
Fossil remains of arms two to three million years old indicate a shift from starting to manipulating.
Some people believe that experiencing more artificially-provoked Lucid dreams, if it happens often enough, can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the fact that the lucid substances extend the period between the REM phase.
If at night you have a smaller number of REM stages, the situation where you really sleep and the body recovers becomes not often enough to present a problem.
It's just as exhausting as you wake up every twenty to thirty minutes to watch TV.
The result depends on how often your brain tries to dream in the night.
The Italians did not go well in North Africa almost from the very beginning. Within a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussar regiment took over the fortress Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, commander of the Tenth Army.
Marshall Italo Balbo, the chief governor of Libya and the immediate heir to Mussolini, was killed on June 28th in a friendly fire as he landed in Tobruk.
Modern torture as a sport exists at several levels. He is trained by students in universities and is part of professional and Olympic competitions.
Sports is mostly played in the format of the duel, one swordsman fights another.
Golf is a game in which players use bats to hit holes with their balls.
Usually 18 holes are played, and players usually start at the first hole in the field and end up in the eighteenth.
The winner is a player who performs the least hits or swings with a bat to finish the game in the field.
The game takes place on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut so it's shorter and called \"Green-
Probably the most widespread type of tourism is the one most people connect with travel: recreational tourism.
Then people go to a place different from their daily life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camps often represent the places where tourists visit the most.
If the goal of the visit is to know the history and culture of the area, then we are talking about cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights in a particular country or simply devote themselves to only one area.
After the colonists noticed the activity, they called for reinforcements.
The front-row units were both the 1st and 3rd Colonel of New Hampshire with 200 soldiers, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men have taken positions along the northern wall of the colonists.
When the tide made a gap along the Mystic River on the northeast peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a stone wall north to a small beach on the coast.
Gredley or Stark put a stake at 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot until ordinary soldiers passed.
The US plan has relied on the launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalader was to launch a diversion attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block reinforcements.
General James Ewing was to lead 700 troops across the river in Trenton Ferry, block the bridge across the Assunpink stream and prevent the escape of enemy troops.
The main assault unit, consisting of 2400 troops, had to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one under Green's command, and the other under Sullivan's command, to begin the attack before dawn.
With the change in the length of the race from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed becomes much less important, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, the first-class racer at 800 meters, which can run in two minutes, has to be pretty fast, but either way he has to work on stamina.
A little cross running winter in combination with the exercise of the upper part of the body in the gym is the best preparation for the season race.
Proper eating habits alone cannot create superior performances, but they can have a significant impact on the general health of young athletes.
Maintaining healthy and balanced energy intake, effective habits of fluid intake and knowledge about the various aspects of diet replacement can allow athletes to get better performance and to enjoy sport.
Running at middle distances is relatively cheap sport. However, there are many delusions about several parts of the equipment needed to participate.
Products can be bought as necessary, but most of them have a small or no impact on performance.
Contrasts may find that they prefer a product even if it is of no use to them.
Atom can be considered one of the fundamental building elements of all substances.
This is a very complex entity, which, according to the Bohr model, consists of the central core around which electrons are turned, similar to planets turning around the sun – look at picture 1.1.
The core consists of two particles: neutron and proton.
The protons have a positive electrical charge, while the neutrons don't have a charge.
Before you examine the victim, make sure you're safe.
You must be careful what position the victim is in when you approach and notice any worrying details.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and experience of disaster are the intermediaries in relation to pain and stiffness in the crosses.
Only the effects of disaster, not depression and fear, depended on the regular weeks of structured physical activity.
Those who took part in regular activities demanded greater support in terms of negative pain experience, as well as the difference between chronic pain and unpleasant feeling caused by normal physical movements.
The vision, i.e. visual ability, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, or the eyes.
There are many different structures of the eyes, whose complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different abilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness; they also require different ways of processing when interpreting input and different values for optimal operation.
The population is a group of individuals of the same species that inhabits a particular geographical area.
In case all individuals in the population are identical in view of a particular phenotypic feature, they are called monomorphic.
If individuals have several versions of certain properties, they are considered polymorphic.
War ant colonies also walk and nest in different stages.
In the nomadic stage, military ants march at night, and in the daytime they rest.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the food supply is reduced. During this phase, the colony builds temporary ants that are replaced every day.
Each such nomadic walk lasts about 17 days.
“What is the cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella” – meaning “small room ” – and the first one was forged by a microscopicist who observed the structure of the corked stopper –
The cell is the basic unit of all living creatures, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.

The occasional specialized air tours go inland, for hiking or a visit to the South Pole, where there is a large base.
South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1,600 km long path leading from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to half.
It consists of compressed snow with filled cracks and tags. This road can only be traveled with specialized tractors and towing sleds with fuel and supplies.
These means of transport are not very nimble, so the trail of long-distanced around Trans-Antarctic Mountains to reach the highlands.
The most common cause of the accident in the winter is the alleys, sidewalks, and especially the stairs.
At least you need shoes with proper sole. Summer shoes usually slide on ice and snow, and even some winter boots are inappropriate.
The sample must be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material is soft enough at cold temperatures.
Some boots have Krampones, and there are also nicknames with slippers for slippers that are placed on the heel or heel and paid and are suitable for use with most shoes and boots.
Pete should be low and wide. Roads and roads are often sprinkled with sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) to increase tension.
Lavine are not unusual; steepness can withstand little, and excess leaves in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so its collapse always causes something else. The fall of snow can in itself be the cause of new slopes.
Sometimes the original driving event is the warming of snow in the sun, sometimes snowfalls, sometimes other natural phenomena, and often human.
The tornado is a very low pressure, which sucks the surrounding air in and up.
They create strong winds (often 100 – 200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
At first, they are like castaways coming down from stormy clouds, and then they become “tornade ” when they touch the ground.
Personal providers of VPN (virtual private networks) represent an excellent way to bypass political censorship and commercial geofiltering towards IP address.
They are stronger than network proxy servers for several reasons: reroute all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better service quality. They are encrypted and therefore harder to spy on.
“Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of it, claiming they want to, “to prevent copyright violations –”

You will often have to buy a special global number that allows PSTN phones to call you. The location of the number is important to the people who call you.
Real-time text translation applications – applications that can automatically translate whole segments of text from one language to another.
Some applications in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages found in characters or other objects in the real world when the user directs a smart phone to these objects.
The translation programs have advanced dramatically, so now they often throw out more or less the exact translation (and less nonsense), but they still need to be careful, because it is possible that the translation is completely wrong.
One of the most famous applications in this category is Google Translation, which allows extra-net translation after downloading the desired language data.

In particular, in the numbering systems in Belgium and Switzerland, where French is spoken, there are differences from French spoken in France and the pronunciation of certain words differs slightly.
However, all the Belgians and Swiss speaking French probably studied standard French at school so they could understand you even if you use the standard French number system.
