I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound ridiculous.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched a box in his jaw.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I used the word \"Alice\" to point it out.
I suggested it.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I quit smoking.
I gave up.
I grow cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I love your website.
I really want your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd like to learn French a lot.
It would be really nice if you kept your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I got one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain down.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister break the letter.
But I didn't really see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Caloric potatoes?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
\"I see,\" said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Everybody happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I just swung my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Did you get outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Dadba really slow today, or do I think?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on his face.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the chalet.
I slept on a bus.
I cut through the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you a house?
Isn't this a little too convenient?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mom?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
It means yes or no.
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarkasam?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is it deep in the lake?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this seat available?
Is this all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do it.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You spoke to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the search for a way out of this cave.
I say we go home.
I'm starving you to get down.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I suspected it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swam into the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even hook up with you if I were you, if it were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It seems aimless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
It can't be!
It's about you.
It was much more than I expected.
Never, ever, never could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what lets him down.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do it; either way, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like God knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with it.
It had to be made.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what it's like.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice point.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty good.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it might be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a cretin.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's got a ring on him.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I mean, Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's best not to drink the water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him back.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you should help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you spend too much time with Tom.
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I've been thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought I had it coming.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a job up your ass.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
I thought you'd found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Well, don't you hate him?
I thought he was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you could swim?
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better at playing chess than I am.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in a lot of pain here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid on the toilet.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no way I'm going to finish the job in one day.
Today is less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
He looked terrible.
You looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
I think it's familiar.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, and my head is killing me, and I'm a very hungover.
Looks like these two are back in a relationship.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He cut me up.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll come by tonight.
Maybe it looks weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you so.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get it out.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm in a room.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
It was raining two days ago.
He had a big problem with it.
I tried to explain it to him, but I didn't button it.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's about to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended to check for any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medicine they prescribed you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over for us.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to leave for a while.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false clue.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming on foot fast.
It's a simple job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He's been disassembled.
It's just a pain in the ass.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is incredibly warm.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
You'd better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive yourself than to be a pessimist and to be right.
“ It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. ” “ Then why are you still alive?
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
Time to close.
Stay here.
It's known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
Looks like her style.
It seems to me that it's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to swear.
It's 10 o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's just.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's dressing.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
That's good.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little forward.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't have much of a priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It will not be easy to do this without great help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really hot.
That sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's broken.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
It's still bad.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them at a place of their choice.
It's very, very strong.
It's bullshit.
It's completely wrong.
You can't handle this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
No matter what, I'm guessing.
There's wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're incredibly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and directed it toward the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor for me to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
It's been an arena day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It's been an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
That was an offer I couldn't turn down.
She was a business to me that I spent the night with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a rough test.
It was a hot night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It's been a beautiful evening.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was awful.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was getting dark.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been proven that the fleas that live on dogs jump higher than the ones that live on cats.
It was so grand.
It was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
It was a lot of blow.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was impregnable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a shot.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It won't cost you to fix it.
It won't help lies.
It's not gonna help you.
It works well.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything.
I need you immediately.
I used to hear you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything that needed to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always been helped by someone.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get into one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little busy with someone else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had much worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been informed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I rang for hours.

You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have such counsel in mind.
She can be trusted.
You can shackle me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as you want.
Now you must leave, sir.
You can leave and stay as you please.
You can handle it.
You'll be fine.
You can handle this.
You can have mine.
You know children's voices without problems.
You can make your job easier.
You can rest.
Now you can sit down.
You can stay in here.
The only way you can stay is if you're quiet.
You can study here.
You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny it.
You can't deny it.
You can't do what you want.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
You can't help us now.
You can't leave a baby alone.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that happen.
You can't marry Tom.
There's nothing you can prove.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're getting data fast.
You cook turkey with pears.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could've said no.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
You should have found them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would have done the same thing in my place.
You did a bad job.
You've done a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about that, right?
You've already done that.
You did your best.
You shouldn't like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're sick, right?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know, my dick.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be there for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything curly.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You go get Tom and come back.
You got one shot.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair's a wreck.
You hate us, don't you?
You have a great job.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You've got small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You've been a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You've got kind eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I'm paying you my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Soft hands.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay away from him.
You can't lose your touch.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very pretty lips.
You've got very pervasive eyes.
You heard me.
You just got back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Children, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You want your life, don't you?
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known for time.
You'll feel better.
You're gonna get yourself a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get it back.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You'll come with me and dot!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You'll have to learn more valuable next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
You'll never be admitted to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
She looked beautiful.
You look familiar.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look really good.
You look sad.
You look imaginary.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave your word.
You're disturbing me.
Maybe you'll be needed.
You can go anywhere.
You might have to help us.
You're allowed to sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure you've been relieved.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You've got to protect the kid.
You can't give up.
You've got to get through the trouble.
You have to learn valuables.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You should buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You should make him listen.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You haven't asked why.
He didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One's life.
You should create a habit of brushing your teeth at every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You owe me nothing.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're on fire.
You're on fire.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have disgraced the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're full.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real man-hat.
You're acting weird.
You're a freshman.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You're really good.
But you lied to her.
You really need a shrink.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're such a nerd.
You're bright.
You're a insightful man.

You're experienced.
You're a righteous man.
You're beautiful.
You're free to go.

You're in the middle of a nightmare.
You're hurting me.
You're not telling me.
You're impressive.
Now you're in charge.
You're in power.
You're incompetent.
You're powerful.
You took my place.
You're in no danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're a little weak.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
You're great.
You're worrying Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not so young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give all of Tom's money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can leave now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You're out of alcohol.
You've got too much to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a poet.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a tight town.
You're perfectly safe.
You're really sweet.
You're really good.
You're very lucky.
You're for laughing.
You're funny.
You're rude.
You're insane!
You're very attracted to me.
You're very dramatic.
You're very helpful.
You're very passionate.
How negative you are.
You're a little rude.
You're kind of rude.
How stubborn you are.
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
You're such a nerd.
You're such a pig.
You're supposed to be helping them.
You're annoying me.
You're terrible.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
You're the only one who's met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.
You're weak.
You've ruined your whole life.

You're being devious.
You're so smart.
You're very good with kids.
You're very lonely.
You're very direct.
You're so sassy.
You're very cut off.
You're welcome to wait here.
You're among friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You shake too much when you shake hands.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's a good memory.
Your moon is coming back.
Your mom put the collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is difficult.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your statement is up to date.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith sucks.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty hot.
All your stuff's here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's unbuttoned.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were gonna text me the other night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to know the answer already.
You look like you're studying.
You seem to have an infection.
It's kind of hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You should ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Don't overdo it.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You should eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You should get a good night's sleep.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.
You should go to bed early.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
You should pay your rent in advance.
You only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try writing a card.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you're driving the bike.
I need you to write Tom a thank-you letter.
You smell like shit.
You sound relieved.
You sound very safe.
You're making your ankle.
You're so pretty.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so fun.
You used to love Boston.
You're in the back.
They've drunk you.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
We missed you.
It was of great benefit to us.
You're right from the beginning.
You've been making whites again!
You bought something to Mary.
You beat me.
You beat them.
That's how much you've done.
You scared her.
You've gone too far!
You have a rash.
You're worried enough.
You got me all wrong.
I promise you.
You do now, don't you?
You must let me pass on a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
It made Tom miserable.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen worse.
You've been putting this off for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky to survive the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You did great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the painting.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna win.
You worry too much about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
