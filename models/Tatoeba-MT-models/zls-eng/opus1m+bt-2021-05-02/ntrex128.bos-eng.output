Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity of the “Mapetovites ”
Some members of the congregation were terrified because of the proposal to change their title as “the members of the Welsh Parliament” (MWP).
It was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation across the political spectrum are concerned that this could become a subject of ridicule.
A Labour member of the congregation said that his group is concerned “because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp ”
For readers van Wells: In Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means waste.
A member of the Plaid political group said that the group \"is not satisfied\" in general and proposed alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was \"opened\" on name change, but noted that there was a small difference between MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary commission currently working on a draft law on introducing a change of name said: “The final decision on the description of the titles of members of the assembly will, of course, be made by members themselves,
The 2017 government law gave the assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in a major support for the appointment of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the commission has given priority to the name of members of the Velsko Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give headaches to chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Law will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the Commission's plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last chance to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to referendum on change of name of state
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to \"the Republic of Northern Macedonia\"
The people's vote is organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that their northern neighbour's name is a property of its territory and is persistently opposed to its EU and NATO pact requirements.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, an opponent to the plebiscites about changing the name, said he would not recognise the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change is called the simple price they must pay for EU and NATO pact membership.
The bells on St. Martin are silent while the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
\"The older people I spoke to say that every corner once had bars and churches, \"Mr. Adams said.
\"There isn't one or the other today
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
\"People today socialize differently\" he said.
“The bars are no longer the quarterly daily residents in which people go on a regular basis.
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not take as long as the managers expect, “and sooner or later, they will return to where they started,
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who won't help preserve the remaining neighborhood shrines.
\"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be whites, he said, \"that is why they will speed up the closure of these churches because the people who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches,
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis – the Metropolis community in 1870 and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodists community moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby has taken ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the trade boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
In 1939, fire damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made a plan for reconstruction, they ordered an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ “the bells of the poor ”
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: “cultural treasure – and“ uninhabitable historical instrument –
The Tiffany Ng expert from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by the black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organ in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin's Church couldn't find him a replacement.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by church heads and other Episcopal diocese.
The bishopric administration – the administrative body of the diocese, consisting of the church heads – wrote to the bishopric in July expressing concern that the bishopric \"will seek to pass the costs - the bishopric administration, even though the bishopric administration was not included in the rental of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishopric.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark hurt 13-year-olds during lobster hunting in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack took place just seven hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach Beach Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy crying for help and then he and the group drove up to him and helped to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a thrill for catching lobsters, but then \"he realized he was yelling, \"She bit me! \"
She bit me!'
His entire clavicle was torn apart, and Hammel said that he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I called on everyone to get out of the water: ‘The shark is in the water!’ ” Hammel added.
The boy is transported by helicopter to Rady's pediatric hospital where his condition is being driven critically.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a speech to the media that the shark had already been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but that it was determined that it did not belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the hull.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for a period of 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Boots chains, Superdrug and Debenhams to department cosmetic products in the style of department stores in which professional assistants work.
As part of a significant breach into the beauty market in the UK worth 2,8 billion pounds, which is on the rise as sales on fashion and household equipment markets decline, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be extended to more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in cosmetic products comes because supermarkets find ways to use the shelves used once for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetics by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal brands, maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its make-up line Boutique by making most products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test the sales venues at two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, and the second will open at Sally Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets must make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's chain, said the shops would look more and more like supermarkets in an effort to strike back chains with large discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened up the Argos department in hundreds of its stores, and he also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, saying it increased food sales and purchasing profitability.
The previous attempt by a supermarket to modernise its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended infamous.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots chain in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended with a fight over the distribution of drug income in their shops.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 apothecary to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was said to have a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's chain, said: “We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our brands range is designed to satisfy all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now invulnerable to the location of the beauty market that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying –
Peter Jones - angered - after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal worth 11 million pounds
Dragons Dan's star, Peter Jones, is “worsy – after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his own 11 million-pound personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and extra equipment Truly.
The company of this couple is compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
This Morning, 37, announced her departure through Instagram.
Holly Wlloughby has angered Dragons' Dan Peter Jones' show star by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have said that Jones was \"excited – when a golden girl admitted television, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in the area of Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, mean that there is no longer time to devote their brand of home and extra equipment to Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortunes estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) posted her departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said: “Holly put Truly at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would have secured her a profit through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has amazed everyone involved.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday. It was so close to launch.
There's a lot of products in Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale.
Experts believe that going to the head of this Morning show, which is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays to launch dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Wiloughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as the company manager.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the lead in I'm A Celebrity's ITV show.
A source close to Jones last night said, \"We wouldn't comment on his business –
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about criticism he could get from the media over comments that could be described as \"unpresidentally\" and for a positive attitude on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said with his funny voice \"New Readers\"
\"I didn't give in at all.
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step forward to denucleating North Korea.
But the denucleization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, High-Correan diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a \"adequate response\" by the United States to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his convention speech.
\"We're doing great with North Korea,\" he said.
\"We have been one step since the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relationships -
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results -- the suspension of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of US troops.
And he stood up for his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
\"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here,\" Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of the Lombok island has been doctored, the state of national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult, \" Mrs Sumbung said.
While the organisation Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to the Palace, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Pala to see if we should allow international agencies to participate in the aid.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is saddened how unfit this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no tsunami siren on the island of Palu, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in the ideal conditions, travel between numerous Indonesia islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to provide assistance to earthquake victims is on their way to the Palace, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's time-consuming infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railroads.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Joko's administration and is expecting new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced because of the street struggles of Christian and Muslim groups, using swords, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: The Liverpool football player Daniel Sturridge scored a deep-equipped hit on Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Prime Minister League shot at the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left, and then he kicked to the outside stand.
The ball flew high above the crime scene, turning to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over the Kep Arrisabalg that was in the jump and fell into the net.
\"It was only up to the positioning, until receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,\" said Sturrudge to LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball –
Chelsea led 1-0 half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a hit in the 25th minute.
In that attack, the blue man added the ball to Mate Kovacic before running from the middle of the court into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly touched and returned the ball to the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, citing Hazard into a crime scene.
Hazard was faster than a defense and ended up near a stand by inserting the net with his left foot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in a three-hour group phase of the League of Champions at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday.
Chelsea plays Videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock in London on Thursday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many buried people have been reported in ruins of buildings that were destroyed by a 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in the Merseyside area this morning.
A 40-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street Street, and a 30-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people nearby who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I call on all who were near John Street Street Street and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on the car control plates, to contact us since they may have information that is important to the investigation --
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know their wife arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The residents are now told they'll have to wait hours before they're allowed to go back inside.
They heard a cop tell a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She kept saying, \"This is so horrible.\"
At 2:00, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next door.
Most of the officers were inside the police cordon monitoring the residential building.
All who have any information are invited to contact directly @MerPolCC, called 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, citing the 247 case since 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament has become the latest monument in the middle of a \"revision of history\" argument.
Its removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England that were carried out by his Puritan followers in the manner of Taliban.
But Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's proposal as \"stupidity\" and \"trying to review history\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society Society, said: “In the context of the ongoing debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character would become a target in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't even order, nor did he have to fight in English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestors Thomas of the past century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell's author, Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell many consider, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be the protector of Parliament from external pressures, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of a lasting historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a distinctive character representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the power of the Lord's protector are also worthy of fame and remembrance.
The killer pig caused the death injuries to a Chinese farmer.
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only to be Yuan's last name, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in a pig's blood in a market in the city of Liupanshui in the Guizhou area, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The hog was preparing to inject vaccines into the pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xing in Qinghai area, China.
Apparently, he arrived with a cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan district on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood around his mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighs 550 libres inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and dismembered, ” said a cousin who introduced himself to Wu, Guyyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuana or his cousin.
The market manager told Eventing News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while police collected evidence on site.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating damages for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 libress fell for a Welsh farmer along with his tractor until his wife scared her off and sent her away.
After the pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “strike”
\"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough, he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa has weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floods over showers across northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa's first-class hurricane winds reached 85 miles per hour of east time on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a gap in the Pacific and is moving towards the East and the West coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, application and possible slides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfalls that will reach at local level 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in southwest regions, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration in weather conditions and typical spread of tropical rain.
Walking out in the desert would be extremely thoughtless with the danger of tropical rain.
The heavy rain in the canyons could result in raging rivers, and the thunders of the locally strong winds and sandstorms.
The upcoming gap will bring local showers on the parts of the coast of southern California.
The total rainfall of over half an inch may be possible, which could cause application and slippery Augustes.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
A few scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach Four Conners on Tuesday and will continue all Wednesdays.
In October, high temperature fluctuations across the United States may occur as the Arctic becomes colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will again try to collect and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Long-term weather forecast announces a high potential temperature above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of a high court Thursday and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1980, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political repugnant continues, with emitters breaking up regularly due to Friday's latest plot: an agreement that Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a week-long investigation of the indictment.
Ford told the Senate's judicial commission that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh's approach was felt and tried to break up at a high school party.
In passionate history, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this probably looked at more than 20.4 million people Friday.
The company is computerised by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network channels.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties with adding people who monitor the transmission from the office.
For a better spell, it's an audience similar to one followed by football elimination matches or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of 5.69m viewers during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest is high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the play on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protestors yelling at him after attempting to enter the elevator to attend a hearing by the judicial commission.
He was standing down for a few minutes while he was being insulted, live on CNN.
\"I am standing here in front of you – said one woman.
\"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: “You have power while so many women are powerless ”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission's hearing.
Cables and television networks were broadcast live for hours later while the judicial commission voted whether to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said it would only be done on condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the dubbed next week, which the minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was partly persuaded to talk to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have had enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh indictment.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of \"playing politics\" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of \"playing politics – with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times daily.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference of conservative parties in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview to her on the front page of the journal, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU take customs duties from each other is absurd,
Wade Sims' murder: Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of death of LSU players
Police have arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU club basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police administration said.
Officials posted a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB network channel CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to killing Wade.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The east area's mortuary of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot from a gun to the head and neck.
The department said the merits belonged to the police working group for Louisiana fugitives, the state police crime lab, the Southeast University police and the residents of the area who helped in an investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva Club thanked the district agency for the implementation of the law on “martiness and the pursuit of justice,”
Sims was 20 years old.
The striker six feet high and six inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at Club LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the LSU Will Wade Club said that the team was \"desperate\" and \"in shock\" because of Wade's death.
\"This is what we keep worrying about,\" Wade said.
Volcan's dumping ashes all over Mexico City.
Ashes that bloat the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern corners of the Mexican capital.
The national disaster protection centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay safe after volcanic activity in the crater has increased even after 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered in 24 hours.
The center followed more earthquakes and rumbles.
Photos on social media show a thin layer of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulkan has been known as \"Don Goyo\" since 1994.
Police face Catalonia Separatists before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protestors, independent supporters, clashed with the police's special squad, when thousands joined the counter-demostrations to mark the anniversary of the polarizing Catalonia referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special squad of police, threw eggs and paints at them, making dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, attacks against police officers who used pendreks to suppress the fight broke out.
The supporters of independence have been chanting for hours, \"No forgetfulness, no forgiveness – and they have clashed with the Union's supporters who were shouting \"Live Spain\"
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protest, a local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region that has been placed on the line for independence a year after the first October referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which Catholic separatists of fame.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although turnout was low because the opponents of the dismemberment boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalonia authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by violent conflicts across the region.
The groups that advocate independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catholic independence.
\"Las year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because it enabled them to vote, but we are in a pinch now, he said.
Although they took a key but close victory in the local elections last December, the Catalonia Party that advocated independence had difficulty holding momentum because some of their most famous leaders were in self-inflicted exile or in detention, expecting trial because of their role in organising referendums and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who telephoned a police protest, said politicians supported the conflict on both sides.
\"It's getting more tense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in elections for the European Parliament next year.
\"Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and repression imposed by the Spanish authorities – he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Cars Bused in the House · Global Voices
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after multiple times driving into a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at some point a car was shot from a crossbow.
The Menge shot Livingston won 1:0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal is to secure a victory for Livingston.
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches at the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menge's goal was key, while Gary Holt's club is equal to Hiberny in second place.
Gerrard's club has not registered a single victory in the Prime Minister's League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts that eight points fall short next week.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended a series of six-game league wins, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against lack of sharpness
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt to get past the goal line, then Alan Lichgrove's attempt passed naked after he slipped to receive the ball Craig Halkett's head transferred to the goal.
The hosts responded to allowing the Rangers to play ahead of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free strikes.
And that's how you scored a key goal.
A free shot was given against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and hit the middle of the criminal space.
By that moment, the Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by a goalie named Allan McGregor's goalie, and Lithgow was kicking too wide out of another free hit for Livingston.
The Crosses were constantly entering Livingston Penal Area and were constantly defended, while the two penals they were looking for – one after the foul against Deputy Player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the game by hand – were not awarded.
‘Fenomenal Game – Livingston – Analysis
Journalist BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and score of Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the upward path.
Their style games and players have almost not changed since they returned to the top, but great credits belong to the Holt which has given the team energy since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading an excellent organized defense, until Menga through the entire match gave peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerrard's bat every once in a while, they didn't reach that level.
The final blows were missed – they only made it through the ranks of the hosts once – and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Kelno
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of smiles and blue sky as leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany, aimed at correcting NATO's relations with allies.
Issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU entry spread.
Erdogan then went to Keln to open a huge new mosque.
This is the town where the largest number of Turks outside Turkey lives.
The police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect division in the opinion of a guest whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
Deptford traffic accident: Bicycles killed in a car collision
A cyclist died in a car collision in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a traffic road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 p.m. British time.
The car driver stopped and intervened the emergency team, but the man died instantly.
The crash took place several months after another cyclist died in a car accident in which the driver left the scene, on Childs Street Street, which is about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
London police say they are working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets are closed, the buses are diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Six employees injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in riots in a men's high-security prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison, in the Worcestershire area, on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British time and still last.
A special task force of the officer \"Tornado\" has been called on to calm the riots involving eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Officials received minor facial injuries and assistance provided on site
A spokesman for the prison administration said: “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff received medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be forwarded to the police and could be extended to prison sentences,
The Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was called to prison for serious riots involving staff attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be of use in the areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression hits Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa goes through desert southwest areas with its remaining energy, carrying a flood risk.
The National Weather Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will announce rain Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Meteorology Administration in Phoenix pointed out that only “ten tropical cyclones since 1950 kept the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, while in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies chain and Great Basin, there will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no flood fear, Ross' rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of this rainfall will probably benefit as the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the US drought control agency, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona has been hit at the least by extreme drought, the second highest category, according toweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a slide on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane power at 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific and it will start to soar.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The showers in parts of Mexico could be very strong and may pose a great risk of flooding.
“The total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baj California to northwest Sonora, and perhaps up to 10 inches,” reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico with a force of tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday late evening.
\"The main danger expected of Rose or its dregs is major showers in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest Desert, according to the National Hurricane Centre.
These showers are expected to cause a brisk flood for life and apply in the deserts, as well as slides in the mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4:00 a.m. British time.
He's been taken to the hospital and he's stable.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, police said Avon and Somerset.
Officials are appealing to call those who have any footage of the events on their cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh \"suffered downstretch and anger – democratic parties
\"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and unheard tactics of the democratic party – Trump said at a rally in Helling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had \"carried down and angry - democratic parties during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he sexually assaulted several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people saw a glow, quality, and courage-- Kavanaugh that day.
\"The vote for the approval of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most creative legal minds of our era, a lawyer with great public service achievements, said a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president has directly touched the appointment of Kavanaugh as he discusses the importance of republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
\"Five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
Although I am not running for office, I am actually running for office, he said.
\"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates,
Trump claims that Democrats strive to \"prove resistance and distraction\"
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Hundreds lost their lives in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Pal on Friday, when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, referring to many in death and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
\"When the risk of tsunamis was released yesterday, people were still dealing with their activities on the beach and didn't get away immediately, and they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesia disaster recovery agency, speaking in Jakarta.
\"The tsunami did not come alone, he carried cars, dung, houses, hit everything on land,\" said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the town of Pal.
Air photos issued by the disaster agency show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesian technology assessment and application agency (BPT) said in a statement that the energy of Friday's huge earthquake was 200 times greater than the strength of a nuclear bomb dumped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of the long, narrow bay has increased the strength of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as \"silent\" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palou, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications \"were completely cut off without any information – from Donggala, Nugroho said.
\"More than 300,000 people live here – they said in the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to endangered areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse,\" they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
The amateur records divided by social networks show a man on the top floor who warns people on the street below panicfully about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuthers couldn't confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused the power outage that cut off communications on Palu by making the rescue efforts of the government difficult.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport is only open for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled an evacuation centre visit in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision must have arrived from Donggala in Pal, where the employees were located in tents erected in the courtyard of the office, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the way, Mr. Doseb said.
\"They told me they saw many destroyed houses,\" he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to make first steps in disaster mitigation, there were complaints that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers would not be allowed to travel to the Palace.
Under Indonesian regulations, the inflow of foreign funds, supplies and people is possible only if the scene of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
\"This is still a disaster of the provincial level – said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared \"
While the second night of Friday's earthquakes and tsunamis falls on the Palace, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be lessened.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was buried under the ruins next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragladers outside of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roe Hotel, including Mr. Mandagia, were his students.
\"As an senior member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burdens – he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the circles of the paraglader he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the contestants in Palou who participated at the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey clutch instead of two blue clutches.
\"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered – he said.
Thieves took $2,750 while filling ATMs in the Newport complex on the Left
On Friday morning, thieves stole $2,750 from workers in Newport who filled the ATM in Newport on the Left.
The car driver emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man \"run behind Brinck's employee\" and stole a sack of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, it stood in a statement, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
By announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “It will be previously known as Kanye West –
West (41) has been known for some time under the name Ye and used the name for the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred prior to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to promote his new album, Jandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the performance for “emotional reasons,” said the emission author.
In addition to the refinement of his current professional name, West had earlier said that this word had religious significance for him.
“I believe that ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio director Big Boy.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It was created from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are
He's one of the many famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without lines and big letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use an army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retribution against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that “he would never use the army to conquer the Mexican people,
The army shot at peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time the leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly subsidies to those who study and open several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and practical artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the US authorities issued announcements on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally lacks an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the domain of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
\"Double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence – Lee said.
Duplicated funds could double the chance that further major achievements in the field of artificial intelligence occur in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Supersile of Art Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, was the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent art intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the most ranked American Othello player, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised earlier US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they planned the next competitions where future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
\"It's not China's academic leaders that's what corporations do to us,\" Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed great individuals from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to consolidate their efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
\"I think that we should automatically offer green tickets to doctorates from the domain of artificial intelligence – he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of the new generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House has announced the establishment of the Election Committee for Art Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that sought to form a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Sunday to change the country's name to \"the Republic of Northern Macedonia\" -- a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims their northern neighbour's name is a property of its territory and vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could jeopardize Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Djordje Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has been asked whether the referendum will produce a minimum of 50 per cent, which is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot said: \"Are you for NATO membership and the EU while accepting an agreement with Greece --
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO.
\"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us – said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be managed by the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66 per cent of voters went to the polls.
\"I came to vote because of my children, we belong in Europe – said Giose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in Macedonia's referendum on change of names, which could pave their way for NATO Union and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of the tents crucified by those boycotting the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not the back door – Kavadarkov said.
\"We are poor, but proud country.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community –
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring over the required investments in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
\"I believe that a large majority will vote 'for' because more than 80 per cent of our population is for the EU and NATO -- Zaev said after the entry of the ballots.
He said the result would be \"for-for-be-confirming our future\"
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30% and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum -- below the necessary turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would vote \"yes\"
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes a 50 per cent turnout plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-West government since it came to power last May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero walks through the entire Brighton defense and scores the goal
Sergio Aguero and Racheem Sterling have rid themselves of Brighton's defense in a 2-0 Manchester City victory against Brighton at Ethiad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored the goal at 65 minutes.
The Argentinan attacker received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he was in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green jerseys.
He pushed around one defense player and was faster than a few more on the edge of a naked Brighton.
Then he added to his left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first blow in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguera, who overcame Brighton Matthew Ryan's goalie on the right side of the network.
\"Aguero had some trouble with his feet – said the coach of the City of Pep Guardioll to reporters.
\"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky to have scored the goal at that moment –
But Sterling was the one who gave the sky blues the initial advantage of the Prime Minister League.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In that action Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's side of the field.
It's wonderful he added Leroy Sane to his left flank.
Sane touched him several times before he sent Sterling to the goal.
The skyscraper threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.

Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against Rockies
Since Nationals was eliminated in the elimination match, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the contestant Scherzer hopes to take office Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game of advantages over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still playing.
The Rockies at least have a direct pass due to a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
\"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all the others this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?
Nationals are still scheduled to announce the opening team for Sunday, but are allegedly willing to let Scherzer throw in the situation.
Scherzer, to whom it would be the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw on Sunday when he usually rests.
The rightist in Washington leads 18-7 this season to an average of 2.53, 300 stykauts in 220 2/3 inning.
Trump held an event in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation regarding the election of his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of republican electioning in half-terms.
\"Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choice of our lives.
These are one of the great, great - although I did not run for office, I actually am a candidate because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere - he said.
Trump continued, \"You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to restore power using every possible way, you see mean, dirty games.
They don't care about who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are in a mission of \"resistance and distractions\"
\"And you've seen it in the past four days -- he said by calling the Democrats \"angry, evil, evil, and dishonest.\"
He led the Democratic Senator and a member of the Senate Justice Commission, Diana Feinstein, a name that prompted the audience to take it out loud.
\"You remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen –
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
Untolerant to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour members who are said not to be welcome, all because of our expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
Notice from a meeting of the club branch in Nottingham East on Friday, \"we want meetings to be inclusive and productive –
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member, meetings Friday evening were mostly the same.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that way and the promise “kinder, gentler, ” the politics are long forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It became increasingly obvious that different opinions were not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion was assessed on the basis of whether they were acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when I believed that we shared similar political views, he expected me to make a 180-degree twist and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it was a national security or a single European Union market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's accompanied by a wave of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, convictions of downtown politics, and they tell me that I shouldn't be in a labor party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who daily deal with the torrents of sexist or racist insults, but do not retreat.
The most disappointing thing about this political age is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different positions and with every vote of mistrust or change in the selection rules, the party is narrowing down.
I got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been trying to get me to bow my head, be less loud, and then I'm gonna be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher, which made my primary school classroom literally collapse, I have sought to advocate better public services to those most in need, whether as a local councilman or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country rushes to Brexit to endanger households, jobs and our public services, I do not understand why anyone would waste their time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not the momentum in Nottingham, but the voters in my constituency, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that threatening to remove me from the party or political fabrication will not prevent me from acting in the way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of days in Tennent's Prime Minister's League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only one undefeated by ten teams.
In the end, the home team won the victory thanks to superior defense, as well as a large number of used chances, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
\"We have been tested in games so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy – he said.
Robbie Christie of Melrose said: “Ayra, with all due respect, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have.
Grant Naderson's attempt at 14 minutes that turned Frazier Climo, gave priority to Ayra, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors allowed to play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot caught an undisputed attempt.
Climo penalized Ayra's leadership before reaching just before halftime, a turn solo attempt to score for a score of 17:5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, has reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a serious breach of Ruardha Knott, carried out on the stretchers, and Ayr further increased the advantage of the Stafford McDowell attempt, which turned Climo.
The deputy captain of Ayra, Blair MacPherson, then received the yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical superiority with the undisclosed attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, hosts also recovered when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to fouls over the Clim without a ball. MacPherson reached touch down from the penal line behind the upcoming Ayra Mol.
Climo turned, as he's done since the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow to the crime scene and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth host's attempt.

The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, is being prepared to move into the catering industry after learning that he is appointed as director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-seven-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series for which he writes a script and plays along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two men have announced that the coming ninth season will be the last in the series and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Diary Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the “growing restaurant business ” in Glasgow.
\"The sea is ours –: Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag on public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
Returning the exit to the sea is our obligation.
Across the mainland, Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast that they lost in behalf of Chile in a bloody disaster around natural resources in the nineteenth century – as well as a longing to sail again to the Pacific.
These hopes may be the highest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects a verdict of international justice on October 1st after five years of consultation.
\"Bolivia has caught a run in the spirit of unity and light, and of course expects a positive result – said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice's verdict on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia and claims that – after decades of Greek negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here, Morales, the charismatic president of the native origin, who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year, also has a large stake in the ruling that will be passed on Monday.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
A United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is only six months after the final arguments have been heard suggests that the case “was not complicated, ” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of making progress in a Bolivian case, the last four years may have turned him back.
\"The problem of going out to sea has been attracted to the current Bolivian authorities for themselves,” said Zarate.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile – and a chance to“ set a point to 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the question of going out to sea as a political crutch.
\"Bolivia will never give up her right to exit the Pacific – he added.
\"It's a judgment of opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past,
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people wouldn't lift nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicting leaders.
His comments arrived at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the border to restart nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and opposition from the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the government of general scepticism when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up the nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim and Trump summit.
On Paris fashion shows presented the latest line of huge hats you will soon see on nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the hat collection or completely cover the sun, you're in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of demented giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 magazines, overshadowing everything on Paris Fashion Week.
Exceptionally impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the fashion runways.
The most prominent piece of Valentine's play was an over-exposed hat with a wide feathered perimeter that swallowed the heads of the model.
Among other cumbersome supplements were watermelons with ornamental stones, a wizard’s hat, and even ananas, but their purpose was not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had frenzied lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attracting attention – you are lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that giant hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after “La Bombe, a straw hat with a two - foot perimeter that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that designed this very impractical hat that flooded the social networks sent another great creation to the runway – a beach bag that is almost as big as the model that it was wearing.
The Zagasitonandranjasa bag of refia and white leather lunch was a prominent detail of Jacques La Riviera's collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The style of the famous Luke Armitage said about F{: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will arrive at the shops in time for the next summer, since the designer has left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for premeditated fashion accessories.
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of extraordinary academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of extraordinary results on exams, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seeks to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further education, a selected career and a place in the society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum and program, we see that modern languages are still the popular and desirable subject of students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it pleases him.
If you speak to him in his language, it pleases him –
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the test results this year, we see that the languages at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received a grade A in the finals of the secondary school.
Data collected from 74 school members of SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students received an A rating from Mandarin language in a high school final, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those learning French and 63 per cent of those learning Spanish, also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in independent schools, and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that in 17 per cent, the reason for employers' difficulties in filling jobs was the lack of those who know foreign languages.
Thus, knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs needed to know foreign languages, this skill is necessary in the world of globalisation.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it is a skill for life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of the competition.
According to YouG's survey conducted among more than 4,000 British in 2013, 75% did not speak a second language well enough to have a conversation, while the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
As a result, investment in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to languages being taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, you will always find several languages that will be able to choose from independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills needed for success, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are crucial to the future of the country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered as “International Communications Skills”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
\"It will be more than one and less than 48 – Walton said at the official Lakers website.
A reporter for Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about the six-game plans during the Lakers season.
\"I don't need pre-season fights in this stage of my career to prepare myself, he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has started a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five meetings in the next week including visits to friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting his vote to fill the high-level seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o'clock tonight in Eastern Time, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch a Trump rally in West Virginia under a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearings this week concerning Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court, which has been tense over charges of sexual harassment, and the expected Senate vote has been postponed for seven days until the FBI is conducting an investigation.
But the overriding goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans deliver a better result in November elections.
So President Trump's campaign said the meetings this week are being held to \"give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
\"The Congress Control is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we can as we enter the election campaign season – he told Reuters spokesman Trump that he refused to present himself.
Set up at Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's event could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time this month, Trump will visit West Virginia, the country in which he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who's not doing well in the polls.
\"It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have the president come to try to give him a polling rating,\" said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to the Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018.: The US team showed combat to keep hope before individual fights Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The clan swing is a completely fictional concept in sport, but one of which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think's having a swing right now?
\"They ran six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side – Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe of course has the advantage, four points more, with another twelve in play.
The Americans, Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there is a lot that gives them encouragement, among other things, the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each carried three points out of a possible four.
Spieth was great from first to last punch and he leads by example.
Sayings of celebrations were getting louder during his round, in order to end up with a key blow for a tie in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind two after two.
His final blow to win the 15-hole match was welcomed by a similar cry, which reflects the belief that the American team has hope.
\"You just have to do your best to take care of your sword,\" Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players right now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but adorable European couple won all four matches and a play without error.
\"Molliwood was the only couple who didn't play the Gods' kicks on Saturday afternoon, and they dodged them Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they share energy with the noisy audience has been fixed at the top favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory as the sun sets over the courts of the Le Golf National Club.
The best thing would be both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebrations.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly mastered Sergija Garcia, the hero games with four balls that morning, when he was playing pair with Alex Noren.
One god shot and two doubles in the first nine holes buried a Spanish and a Swedish man in a hole they couldn't even come up with.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
A four-ball game is so fascinating to watch closely due to the interactions between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give, and the way a strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage ahead of the final day, but this session of four has also shown that the U.S. team has a desire to fight in which some suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe Leads to 10:6 The Last Day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday's four-balls and four-way matches, it took the lead from 10:6 over the United States.
Inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led with two victories over the moody Tiger Woods, increasing the results so far on the four points of the Le Golf National Club.
Europeans of Thomas Björn fighting to restore the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine golf club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States gave greater resistance to the four-round tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points in 12 single matches Sunday to keep the trophy going.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed \"Molliwood\" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history who won four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they had a great fit and mastered fatigued Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who broke through two matches on Saturday, flashed at moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in the game with four balls and four and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henry Stenson in the fours tournament and suffered 2-1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third in the world.
Europe, however, did not go according to the plan of this pleasant bright day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tournament set the target for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a hard time winning from 2:1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game to come back later and beat Poulter and Rory Mcilroy 4:3 in fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder's bath a team returned after a four-point delay in front of individual matches, although Furykov's title-defensive side is sufficient to keep the trophy.
However, after they are in second place for two days, it seems they could not make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea reports that “no speech ” about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens her mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country will by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said that in the past year, North Korea has taken “significant measures to show good will, such as nuclear and missile testing, nuclear range dismantling and promise not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"But there is no adequate response from the United States,\" he said.
\"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no talk about us being the first unilaterally disarmed –
Although Rie repeated the famous complaints made by North Korea against the resistance of Washington to “the gradual approach to denucleisation by which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denucleisation from the game as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on “denuclarising the Korean Peninsula, ” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States does not give up ‘denuclearization first of all’ and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even opposed to ‘the declaration of the end of the war’, said Ri.
\"The thought that sanctions can throw us on our knees is to release dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust -
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke of in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: \"If we were to negotiate this problem over denucleisation with South Korea, and not with the United States, denucleisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come into such an impregnable position,
However, the tone of Rio's speech differed dramatically from last year, when at the UN General Assembly, he said that the shooting of the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President – Trump called Kim a “raketashem ” on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to \"completely destroy - North Korea, commended Kim for the courage to take action to disarm, but said that much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in effect until North Korea carries out denucleization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set up a time frame for this, saying: “If necessary, let it last two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter –
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: \"The Security Council sanctions must remain strictly and unrelentingly until complete, final, confirmed denucleization is achieved.
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions towards North Korea applicable since 2006, in an effort to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
He met with Rheo outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
He's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the words that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for making \"gangster demands\"
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to defuse the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes \"proper measures\"
He told him Kim told him that \"responsible measures -- required by Trump's security guarantees and steps in order to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to get students to more sleep in an effort to eradicate an increasingly popular macho learning culture – all night long with caffeine –
One academic noted that students of leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of dream medicine at Harvadre's medical school and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course that he considers to be the only one of those types in the United States.
Inspired to launch this course was given after a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my absolute year?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me – she told The Telegraph.
This year's course is held for the first time to show students the basics of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as to improve their general status.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students suffer from serious lack of sleep during the week.
One hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of a room in a student home and students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of the bedtime routine.
In the second part, it was said that a long-term lack of sleep could increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
\"We are aware that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of your health decision to smoke cigarettes, Professor Czeisler said.
Pride culture due to \"wounded nights – still exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students has led to sleep shortages becoming an increasingly difficult problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and quality, should be a “secret weapon – students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, since the lack of sleep of the brain passes into the hunger regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to pass a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarm in time for sleep and waking up and taking care of the harmful effects of the “blue light ” that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circus rhythm, thus causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another depressing defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga shot the decommissioned Steven Gerrard team to defeat 1:0 of Livingston.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after February's 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of the Ladbrokes League Prime Minister, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspired Rangers squad never came anywhere near the equation.
While the Rangers have now fallen sixth, Livingston has climbed third and behind are Hibernian only because of the goals of the difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to show some help when he was being shot by an object on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that exceeded Ayr and placed herself in the semifinals of Bethfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt placed himself on the same eleven Livingston players who took point Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team pushed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated with the possession of the ball, but Livingston had better use his time with the ball.
Little was missing to score the goal just two minutes after Menga first added to empty space sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but missed a big chance and kicked next to the goal.
A deep free hit by Keaghan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense of Alan Lithgow was only able to kick past the goal, near the standoff.
The Rangers were able to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was supposed to get penal in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombians' request.
The Rangers scored only two hits at the goal in the first half, but a former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem defending Lassana Coulibaly's head and tamed the shot directed by Ovie Ayario.
Although the first score of Livingston in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship of power in the course of the game, no one can deny that he was deserved if for nothing else, then for the sake of his efforts.
The Rangers couldn't fight Jacobs' deep-free strike again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately gave a result when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to urge guests to play exactly as they please, with the long balls of both Lithgowa and Halkett.
Holt's team had the chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was doing well to defend Jacobs' attack so that Lithgow from the corner would send the ball next to the goal.
Deputy Rangers player Glenn Middleton asked for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger counter
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning – Almanah: September 30, 1882 on today’s day 136 years ago... is the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans - Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become a device known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the major positions of science, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the movie “Coronada Bell ” in 1950, in which the seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: \"What is that?
Rogers: “This is Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms by your ears, thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans:
\"Hans-Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see ” – malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see ” the malignant cells and then kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells in the course of therapy
The procedure includes removing immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory.
They can thus “see – a protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then re-injected
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovaries of the woman who received the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes removing immune cells from patients, rewriting them in the laboratory so that they can “see – protein HER2, and reinjecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2-helps the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lungs, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the removal of immune cells from patients and learning – the same as how to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a fierce speech of support to Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was scouted in the study during the Saturday Night Live show after a brazen performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, and on the evening he wore a cap with the inscription “Do America Great, ” he insulted Democrats and spoke again about his support to Trump.
\"So many times I've talked to white people who say, \"How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
If I cared about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago, “he said.
The SNL started with a sketch of Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star is making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission on claims of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social networks.
It's unclear whether Rock tried to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the public that he was having a hard time behind his hats.
\"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, \"Don't go out with that hat on your head.\"
They teased me!
And then they say to me that I fell down, he said according to the allegations of Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what it looks like? Adding it to Superman’s cloak because that means you can’t give me orders. Do you want the world to progress?
Try Love -
His comments provoked the whistle of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL show were clearly embarrassed, he reported Variety, while one person who was present said: “The entire studio has completely quieted down.
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing a song I love it disguised as a bottle of Perryr.
Westa supported the head of the TPUS Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not stepping down in front of the evildoers,
But the director of Karen Hunt's show tweeted that West simply \"was what he truly was and that it was absolutely wonderful\"

The star of the series – The Games of the throne – Kit Harrington condemned the toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who is flailing with the sword in violent medieval fantasy, the HBO series of throne games.
However, actor 31, he went down on a macho stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often think they should be harsh to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “something had gone wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in #MeToo.
A whale who recently married a partner from the Leslie Rose Game (31) admitted that he had “a strong need to deal with this problem.
\"I am personally quite concerned at the moment – what we have done wrong with the representation of masculinity – he said.
\"If we teach men how to grow up, when it comes to the problem that we see now,
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading toxic macho culture because of the depiction of characters that appear to be males.
He continued: “What is innate, but what is the matter of rearing?
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets why young men feel they need to fit into a certain pattern of man's behavior?
I think that is, in fact, one of the main issues of our time – how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young people -

HIV/side: China reports rising new cases of 14%
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in the past situation.
In the past, HIV has usually spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of a virus-infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people who receive HIV this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Since 1997, homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China, but they say the discrimination of LGBT persons is widespread.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of conservative understanding in the country.
Virus transmission is often caused by inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff had published data on Republican senators, condemning “dangerous lies ” and“ conspiracy theories.
US Ambassador Maxine Waters denied that one of her staff published personal data by three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
A Democratic MEP in Los Angeles claims that these claims are being posted by experts and websites of the “ultradesic wing”
\"Lyst, lies and even more disgusting lies – Waters said in a Twitter release.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate have reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications is connected to the Waters office and has published information on a member of its staff, Hill reported.
\"This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie – the Waters continued.
“My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security are at risk because of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and absolute lies.
Waters' statement soon provoked a conviction on the Internet, as also presented by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This negativity is exude by rage, ” wrote Fleischer.
\"This states the conclusion that it has no temperament required for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be impertinent.
He can't question the motive of the defendant.
They need to be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the critics of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to lift Waters in mid-term elections, also appeared on Twitter.
\"The big thing if it's true\" was tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned \"the responsible competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims –
\"We will make sure that the perpetrators have been discovered – she continued, \"and that before the law they are accountable for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff,
Review of the movie Johnny English back in action – the soft spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of “Johnny English” – and returned to the screens in 2011 by continuing “Johnny English: Reborn –
Will the ironic autosatrate about how obviously useless we are will be the new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, dumb, incompetent Johnny English rubber face got a new chance to mess something up – with his name more than anything to say that it is a general comical creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose English is not native language.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite bizarre claims on the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a little bit of Mister Bean and a little bit of that guy who played just one note in the theme tune of the \"Chariots of Fire\" – at the opening ceremony of the London Games.
It was also originally based on a traveler and an international man with a secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two of the latest scenes of the show are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knight's armor, and the rotor's knives were short on his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that “severe ” – film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission are confidently adding comical elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not adults, and for me, the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not innovative and developed like Atkinson's silent movies in Mr. Bean's character.
Now it's a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated the British super secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the horror agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, an bloated and beaten character who's already experiencing complete devastation due to the fall of political popularity: Emma Thomson has maestrosly played this character modeled on Theresa May, but the scenario is quite scarce.
Her intelligence counselors have informed her that all active spies are compromised and that she will have to hire one of the retired.
And that's what crazy Johnny English means, who now works as a teacher in a fancy institution, but he's informally lectured on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gigs when English holds a spy academy in a movie's manners – Rock School –
Englisha is quickly returned to Whitehall on emergency instructions and to reassemble it with a former immeasurably patient partner named Bough, who is playing again Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energized and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a little spent.
So Batman and Robin for messing things up again are at the service of Her Majesty's secret service and the lucky fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletov, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the ominous Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odyssay of comical events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, making a mess sneaking into Voltina's luxury yacht and English drives the real anarchy by trying to get acquainted with the inside of the Volta house using earphones for virtual reality.
It's obvious that much effort has been put into this last sequence, but no matter how sweet and cheerful the whole film is as if it's made for children.
It's a pretty central quality.
Like other movies about Johnny English, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with any role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making plans for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider a radical plan for the British to work on four days a week, but they'll be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants company heads to transfer the time they save workers thanks to the IQ (AI) revolution by giving them another day off.
The employees would enjoy the three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would \"be integrated\" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
Switching to a four-day working week has been approved by the Union Congress as the way workers can use the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told Sunday Times: \"The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy in favour of workers, as well as in the party industrial strategy at all.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
But this ambition has no support for the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: \"A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.
The opposition's chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Party's conference last week to expose his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of the \"unfortunate directors\" and \"profitters\" in communal businesses.
The opposition Chancellor's plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not recover their entire investments because the Labours could impose ‘rejections’ on the basis of the injustices observed.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on board companies and to create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10% of the value of companies in the private sector to employees who appear to be picking up annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy speak for the 60-minute show, about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination at least a week from now, raising the question whether the Bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute broadcast correspondent named Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his fellow South Carolina.
\"I think, of course,\" Kennedy said.
\"Before the hearing I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, and I said, \"Did you do it?\"
He was unshakable, determined, unconscionable –
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be insidious.
\"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a strong accusation would be needed – he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett was deeply denied, added Graham, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And anyone she appoints can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, the annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and equally impressive goals – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will gather tens of thousands of people on the large lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true purpose of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 citizens' festival, which was first held, is an extension of a global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the abolition of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or \"parts – such as volunteering, e-mailing to the world leader, telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is a citizen of the world project with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or is it just another vision of so-called “cliktivism – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Citizens of the World Initiative has argued that they have recorded more than 19 million - action - their supporters who have advocated a number of different objectives.
They say these actions have led the world's leaders to announce promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and publications from their actions, and at least 10 billion dollars has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of food, the partnership of investors and realists from Britain who promised to “help their children grow to their full potential ” by promising that Rwanda will allocate $35m to care for the end of savings in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
\"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make social injustices of feeding become a historical footnote – said Ambassador to the Power of Food, Tracey Ullman, visiting live concerts in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Great Britain to improve mothers and children's diet, the government announced that it would fund a food power project, whose interventions would touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, “why do you think you can end extreme poverty? ”
A citizen of the world answers: “It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could block the Navy – Russia for energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, revealed Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – namely, they are there after calling for a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe – he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
\"The United States has the possibility to ensure, together with our Navy, that marine corridors remain open or blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market – he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself \"the voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared it to Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same thing.
\"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less made up of the exploitation and replacement of fuel,\" he said, saying that Russia owns only one card, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “indecent ” project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, would have made Berlin a “conqueror – Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and which needs to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's heated opposition are purely economic in nature and that this is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should have the possibility of choosing suppliers,\" Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction to Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation in Germany, the German Industry Union (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply – Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will \"severely consider the presidential candidacy for the year 2020, said state senator Masachusetts
On Saturday, the senator of the state of Masachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said she would “think seriously about running for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at city hall in the city of Holyoke in the state of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top – she said, and the source of The Hill is quoted as saying.
\"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for President --
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at City Hall, saying he was \"leading this country in the wrong direction.
\"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,\" she said.
Warren has been called up for criticism by the authorities and his candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet published on Friday, Warren said \"Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote\"
However, the results of a poll published Thursday showed that most of the electoral authorities that voted for Warren did not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will \"probably vote in the state of Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/List of Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll found that there is greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's bid, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48 per cent against the candidacy.
Other sound names from the order of Democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSD at Donald Trump's Donald Palin rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
Arrested and accused of domestic violence after Monday night's incident
\"What my son is going through, what he's going through after his return, I can relate to what happens to other families that suffer the effects of PTSD and the vulnerabilities that our soldiers return to, \"he said to the audience at a rally of support to President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “burning theme ” and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added “they are coming back a little different, they are coming back stronger, they are coming back wondering if there is any respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots and all the other military members have given for this country,
He was arrested Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence -- an assault on a female person, a obstruction of domestic violence and the possession of opiate-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 countries, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the review of a new US policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a friendly report to the court on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who dispute this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of prosecutors in the suit of Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Union for Civil Freedoms in August against the federal police has not been revealed.
She said she was abused by her partner “and violent members of his gang, ” but US officials rejected her asylum claim on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace have explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States comes, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States has invalidated the decision of the 2014 Immigrant Appeal Committee that allowed immigrants who do not own documents and fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District District District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy \"regards the decades of state, federal and international law\"
\"The federal law requires that all asylum requests be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and that the chamber thus violates that principle, \"it is in a friendly report.
The lawyers further claim in the report that the police that are preventing the entry of immigrants are damaging the United States economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and \"to ensure the necessary workforce\"
In June, State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant-related cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
\"Azil is only available to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or because of their political opinion, \"Sesions said in a statement on June 11th about politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face daily.

Residents return to their broken homes, rummage through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-degree earthquake have been suffered.
Some of those injured as Dwi Harris who have had their back and shoulder broken are located outside Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being helped out due to ongoing severe side earthquakes.

The U.S. ambassador accuses China of \"violence with propaganda ads\"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in the U.S. newspaper dailyly praising the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's paid addition on Wednesday to Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with US elections marks how US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where they increase tariffs on imports.
In contrast, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed towards exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the formerly long-standing mayor of the state of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in Sunday's newspaper Des Moines Register, \"Now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press –
“During its propaganda, the Government of China is exploiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, placing paid ad in Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
“On the contrary, in the kiosk here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on China’s troubled economic path, keeping in mind that Chinese media are under a firm Chinese Communist Party’s baton, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most promising newspapers refused to make the offer, even though it did not mention what the paper was about.
Republicans deter women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent republicans defending and standing by the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions attached to this issue are very intense, and most of the Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
There is no going back in these things, ” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at the Maxwell University School, in a magazine article published on Saturday.
Reeher said the suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) had recently requested an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
\"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November,,\" Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said in Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protestors cried out \"November is coming – during a demonstration in the corridor of the Senate, while Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to pursue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
\"Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will be huge, \" he said for news Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
\"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But he could be taller, especially among the indecisive female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, don't vote,
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of an alleged sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts felt that there could be negative reactions if the Republicans persist with the appointment.
\"This has become a big mess for the big old party, \" said earlier this week, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, broadcasts the NBC News network.
\"It is not only the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also the way the Republicans dealt with this issue and how they treated it, \"he pointed out for the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priories Group, which supports the choice of Democrats.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided in terms of who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, which gently leans on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that the Supreme Court's candidate showed her his genitals while attending parties during their studies at Yale in 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet that will exceed Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web network, triggers a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Open Source Platform Solid, whose creator is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive investment for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupta-world domination –
\"We have to do it right away,\" he said about the startup.
\"This is a historic moment-
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own \"personal data store on the network\" or \"pod\" (personal online data store).
It can include a list of contacts, a list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it is entirely dependent on users who can access which types of information.
The company calls it “personal support through data –
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides sources, processes and appropriate skills to ensure that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of staff development engineers hired to work on a project and community programmed by volunteers.
From this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralisationd applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
\"We are not asking their permission.
In a Saturday’s release on the Media Platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on the solid.
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in discussing the neutrality of the network.
Although running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, Foundations for the Web and Open Data Institute.
\"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web, \" added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A celebration for Victoria’s Cross given to a priest in World War I · Global Voices
The celebrations in honor of the only priest of the Church of Anglican who was awarded Victoria's cross as a fighter in World War I was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won a confession on September 29, 1918 to attack in the cities of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, several days later he was shot by a sniper and never learned that he had won Britain's largest military confession.
At a parade held Saturday in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial record.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that “it is amazingly symbolic that the monument had been discovered exactly 100 years after the feat that his grandfather received the prize for.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel Saint-Quentin \"through a very dense fog and under heavy fire from the battlefield and machine gunfire\".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with “the greatest heroism, ” leading the platoon forward before chasing without help on the Polish cannon and cutting down three from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s moves were “something I know I could never reach, but also something that causes penance,
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “feels honored to be part of the parade, ” and added that“ the courage of a true hero shows support that many will give,
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of getting Pepa Pig
Imagine that, you stayed up all night watching down the Bellator match 206, to ultimately prevent you from watching the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and was broadcast live during the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, viewers in the UK were amazed when the transmission interrupted Pepa Pige.
Many were not at all impressed that they stayed up all night until the early mornings precisely because of the struggle.
One fan on Twitter described this interruption in a cartoon film as “a kind of sick joke –
\"It is a rule of government where it stands at 6 am that the content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a program for children, \" said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Marketing and Communications Belator, on the question of transfer.
‘-Pepa Pigs, yes-
The president of the company Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
\"I think when I talk about replay, I think we can probably work it out,\" Coker said.
\"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to implement anything until Sunday comes in for us, when it will already be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a interruption, they were circling the correspondence and everything was hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferiority ” because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to become successful.
24-year-old man said that only in high school did he realize that \"not everyone is like me\"
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs representing Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others hope-
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular head of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of the disease.
Showing up as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt less valuable than others because \"it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls,
He said: “To this day, these feelings of less value and feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that “someone, ” he said, so that people would not be disappointed when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance in this year's Commons Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequence and wanted to give others “hopeful ”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American producer of Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - was surprised by -
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who was older than him for 20 years, and said that the age difference had never been a problem.
\"When you experience so much when you're so young -- the first time you showed up at the Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple played the role of the parent boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that his “total perspective ” had changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, it was only about \"I have to win a gold medal,\" he said.
\"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.
His son is the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him \"you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad\" he said.
\"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible,\" he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
\"I simply knew that this was what I had dreamt of all my life - to swim in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,\" he said.
It served as an inspiration to his choice of first songs - Proud of Heather Small - who was ringing in it while preparing for the Olympics and from which he was still passing by the buzzers.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he's gonna play his 47th game on the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to regain his form so this wouldn't be a silly turning point.
Mickelson, who plays on the record for the 12th time, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the bench in the Saturday games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often was the case for the US, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and improving the range in play, hoping to correct what bothers him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the height of his career, is not the ideal choice for the demanding field of Le Golf National, where long irregular terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if I'm field isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open on Sunday's ninth game, Francesca Molinari, who won all four of their games with beginner Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get to the hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
\"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder and embraced me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow,\" Furyk said.
\"He believes in himself very much.
He's a member of the House of Famous and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there were more, but that was the way it went, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's number of Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought certain intangible value to the team.
\"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team, \"he explained.
\"I think it was fun to give younger players a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game -
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup single matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a game in the city of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Sve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a narrow difference of 141-2-131-2.
\"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, \"Bjørn said, imagined after watching the 2018 team which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on the field of Le Golf National.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going all the way tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try and win this trophy and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street on the other side - the world's biggest players –
Delighted by the performance of his players at a heavy golf tournament, Bjørn added: “I would never let this take me.
There's a new day tomorrow.
There are individual games tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're testing yourself as a golfer.
It's a message you have to convey to the players - give the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to do the best he can.
Unlike Björn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play more individually than they did in pairs, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those big turns the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser after Europe performed \"Monster in Medina\"
\"I remember every damn word, \" he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
\"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start just like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When you start with such a kick, it creates a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We formed our set according to that and we put the boys away so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know--
Thomas was assigned an assignment to try and run a counterattack and face Rory Mcilroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
\"I went with this group of guys in this lineup because I think she can cover all the way to the end, \"Bjørn said about choosing single players.
New German warship on hold again
The new frigate of the German Navy was due to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it will not arrive for at least another year due to malfunctions on systems and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch in the transport of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz, ” a leading ship in the class of brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted by army spokesmans.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that were commissioned in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipboard missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to schedule the latest frigates up to two years without returning to the port of birth.
Nevertheless, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were supposed to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time when they start using, states Die Zeit.
An unfortunate F125 frigate arrived in the paper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilding ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key “software and hardware flaws ” that would make the ship unusable if deployed on a combat mission.
Software flaws were of particular importance because ships of class Baden-Wuerttemberg will be operated by about 120 sailors -- exactly half of the number of people operating the old Bremen class frigates.
Also, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy to reduce its impact and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
7,000 tons are believed to be heavy ship “Rheinland-Pfalz, twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to broken hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to an initial 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Petersen Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy were \"run out of ships that could be deployed,
The official said that this problem grew over time, because the old ships were cut off, and no submersible ships were purchased.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out on an estate in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to shed a new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will accompany ordinary bats and species of soprano Pipistrelle, as well as a brown long-eared bat and bat of the kind Daubenton in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
Staff and volunteers of the NHS will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls from bats and what kind they do.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, hopes that the results will show what areas of habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help fortifications to be used to operate habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has significantly decreased over the past century.
They are compromised by works on construction and development, which have a negative impact on the litter and loss of habitats.
Winds and lighting can also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacle on their flight path.
NTS, who cares about more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries across the country, is taking bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who do regular check-ins, litter inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeves estate in Dumfrees and Galloway, which are home to eight out of ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson estate says that the property is ideal territory for them.
\"Here in Threeveh we have a large area for bats,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all good habitats.
But there is still so much unknown about bats, so what we do here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to advance,
He emphasizes how important it is to check if the bats are on the property, as it is possible that the destruction of a single mother’s nest would kill up to 400 female and young, likely to lead to the extermination of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and the law prohibits them from killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scotland Preservation Fund, has encouraged the public to include and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how the population of most of our species is developing –
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers file charges against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges as “false news, ” saying that people“ want to promote themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid her $375,000 to keep this incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his companions, 142 million in the Instagram Live video, several hours after a report on accusations, Ronaldo, 33, he criticised reports calling them \"false news\"
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news, “the five - time gold ball winner said in the camera.
\"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame by saying about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine, \"he added a player smiling.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called “unauthorized reporting of private suspicions, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that a player will seek compensation for “non-material damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years –
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at the Hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After the night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayor reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents delivered to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorra claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was \"99% good guy\" who failed those \"1%\"
It says in the documents that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorra also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to a non-judgmental settlement because she felt “fear from reprisal ” and was worried that“ she would be publicly humiliated ”
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking an annulment because she remains traumatised by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time the attack allegedly took place, and this summer he moved to Italy's Juve diva for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will \"forever regret - if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that \"anxiously – what Toyota UK has said to the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need a deal, \" Mr Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay at the border should Bexit remain without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston factory, made by Toyotin Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
\"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production stop at our factory,\" said Marvin Cooke, director-general of Toyote in Burnaston.
Other UK producers including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fear about how cross-border trade would function if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
The BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main fears concern what car manufacturers call the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyote production line works on the principle of “government at a time – where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made at order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, a break may occur at the border which may lead to a delay in parts and shortages towards industry.
It would not be possible if Toyota kept supplies longer than one day at their factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the \"Chequers\" plan – offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU – was specifically calibrated to avoid these checks at the border –
\"We have to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only to enjoy our current success, but also to seize this opportunity, \"he said in today's Radio 4 programme on the BBC.
\"The example not only of the Toyote but also of the other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been an extremely successful series of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the industry's competitiveness in the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years in Burnaston and is the president of the Union Union Union Union Union Union Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “By my experience, when these jobs are closed down, they never return.
Government spokesman said: \"We need to set out a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU –
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be rescheduled, White House says
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be \"delayed for another week – as a fight continues over Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh's candidate, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the ties between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstructions of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy general's attorney-general or not, thereby endangering Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been months since the topic of speech in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed sounding to record talks with Trump and the possibility of a presidential change based on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House, in the middle of rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd-he wouldn't like- to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Justice Commission hearing, which was witnessed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered Friday that the FBI conduct an investigation into Kavanaugh's one-week indictment, further delaying the Senate vote in full composition.
Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on the Fox News Channel.
She answered the question about her meeting with Rosenstein: “The date is not yet set, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week, considering all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists would invalidate this claim: Sanders did not hold a brief address for journalists at the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a smaller number of brief talks are not the result of the reverberation of the pre-theatric behavior of TV journalists, although she said: “I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerating,
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be strengthened.
“The president is holding more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she said without giving evidence: “We have seen these numbers –
The brief address will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it as much as possible, and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace brief speech to the press --
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences when officials visit.
Personal press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting invisibly and occasionally strange in front of a group of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers working in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about the fears of Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude for the state and the desire to stay after Brexit.
Parliament member Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the costs of the resolved requirements for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: \"The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been resumed during the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the U.K. government also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that for all of you this has been a very troubled time.
For this reason, I wanted to repeat how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here -
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
The defense team's State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after hurting his head on Saturday's defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, reported by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury took place shortly before the half-time.
\"He reached the line of the field and just collapsed there,\" Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him on further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie ended up with an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that \"there are still no details of the type/size of the injury\" and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student in a red jersey, played the first season for Tennessee State after crossing Illinois.
He had five total shootings Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on real estate purchase in UK
Customers from foreign countries will charge higher taxes on purchase of UK real estate, with additional funds used to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Larger taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will be announced today.
This step will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved, seeking to attract young voters to promise that it will ensure more affordable housing care and focus on those who earn more.
The higher fees will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money being strengthened by the government's intention to fight sleeping in the open air.
An additional fee, other than the existing fee, including more levels, was introduced two years ago to another property and purchase for rent, could amount to as much as 3%.
The vault expects the move to increase revenue to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built properties in London are being bought by persons who do not have a residence in the UK, which is why prices are rising, and customers who first buy real estate become harder to own.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities, ” because of the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a taxi reduction to help a number of young people get to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices by buying the first opportunity on land that they did not use, and asked Mrs May to give up the access house quota as soon as possible in order to break the British \"demand of residential policy\"
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed residential reforms, including control of rent and suspension of zero-provoked actions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the Prime Minister to return the British dream - that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as valuable British.
The dream of ownership of the house has become too far for many people, and the inhuman sleep in the open is still very real.
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland\"
Sunderland's head, Jack Ross, says that his \"extreme ambition\" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
The 40-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a Northeast club, which is currently third in the First League, with three points less than the leading one.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadion after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last season.
\"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was on the B-team, and that was it, ” Ross told us about the Sportssound BBC Scotland show.
\"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hamden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I were successful at running a club –
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poett, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletic Club says he did not feel restless because he comes after such big names in such a large club after refusing to offer clubs Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"The measure of my success at this moment will be in 'will I be able to get this club back to the Prime Minister'?\"
According to the structure and possibilities of this club, it no doubt belongs to the prime minister of the League, \"he said.
\"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I'll only be able to consider myself successful if I can get the club back where it belongs.
Ross was only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period he spent as assistant chief at Dambarton and 15 months as part of Harts' coaching staff.
Then he helped to recover Allo from falling into the third category, and St. Miren dragged him from the edge of falling into the lower league to the champions next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably the right intersection,” remembered the downloads of the club Allo.
\"I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management, and now I'm doing it, and in my entire adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I have now.
You can listen to the whole interview on Sportssound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scottish from 12.00 to 13.00 on British Summer Time
Perfect time for a cup is Saturday at 5:30, reveals research
The summer heat wave has increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, sales of 2.7% in July have been growing, but restaurant traffic has dropped by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, from the consulting company CGA, who collected the data, said: “Sustainable sunny time and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup contributed to monitoring July similar patterns as the previous month of June, when pubs achieved a growth of 2.8% and restaurants had an even greater drop.
The drop in restaurant traffic from 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinking have achieved far the best result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period, than there was a drop in traffic in restaurants.
The food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6% in a month, with a three-percent drop in food sales –
Paul Newman, of the RSM entertainment and catering agency, said: “These results continue the trend that we have witnessed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors when it comes to off-home sales.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the decrease in sales of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly painful with already price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over-required relief –
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slower increase in brands.

Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social media that hides from their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social network account that hides from her parents and teachers, reveals research
A study involving over 20,000 primary school students revealed an increase in the number of “false Instes ” - pages
The news has raised fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said that there was a “main ” account that showed parents
Every fifth child, some of whom only age 11, makes orders on social networks hidden from adults.
A study involving 20,000 primary school students revealed a sudden increase in “false Instasts ” – a warrant, as referred to the Instagram photo-sharing page.
The news has increased fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said that they have a clean, head - office to show their parents, but they also have private orders.
One mother who came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who calls other words \"rape me\"
A survey conducted by the organisation Digital Consciousness UK and Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40% of children from 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: He's upsetting the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be \"Athlete's Voice – in the Scottish Athletics Committee\"
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as the non-executive director at the annual assembly of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
\"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her membership in the committee – Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland –
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including the 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and now a regular expert at the BBC, remained motionless after a transitory ischaemic attack.

I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I would recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agile exercises!

Advertise for a traitor where mothers compare to cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that produces traitors has shared opinions on the Internet ad that breast-feedings compared to moose cows.
To mark the launch of a product described as “the first silent publisher, Elvie’s consumer technology company published a commercial inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom of the new pump to milk - issuing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between hay and cows with a song that reads: “Yes, I’m milking but I have no tail, and “If you haven’t noticed it, but it’s not udder, it’s my breasts. ”
Here comes the reference: “pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk, husband himself –
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different response from viewers, while many said it sheds light on the milk industry.
\"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must also become pregnant and be born like us to produce milk, but their babies are taken a few days after they are born, someone wrote.
Elvie Pump Discreet Stands Discreetly in Mother's Brass (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why wouldn't they be used for advertising a traitor to mothers who can keep their babies -
Someone else added: “Advertises without any sense –
Others stood up for the commercials, and one woman admitted that her song was “surveillant. ”
\"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this if I was still breastfeeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I figured it out.
This is a genius product, ” wrote someone.
Another commented: “This is a funny commercial aimed at milk - issuing moms (often at the workplace or in the bathroom) and they feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an ad praising the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many milk - betraying mothers say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, there's no wire or tube and it's standing in the breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out while they're issuing milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother’s company, commented: “Pumpa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By pulling a parallel between breast-feeding cows and muzar cows we wanted to put in focus the milk production and all the challenges that go along with it, reflecting in a fun and understandable way the amazing sense of freedom this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump got into the news headlines.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrants children secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult to find guardians for children.
Traditionally, most of the guardians themselves were migrants without documents afraid to compromise their ability to stay in the country by stepping up to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, senior Immigration and Customs Officer, told Congress last week that she arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of minors without escorting.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the people arrested had not been convicted before.
\"Near 80% of the people who are either guardians or members of the household of guardians are illegally in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're gonna keep looking for these people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to get children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was a previous standard, workers say at the shelter.
Many will appear on a video call instead of personally, in order to request the immigration judge's legal status.
Those who are determined not to meet the terms will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay locked up, the greater the odds are that they will become anxiety or depressed, which can lead to an outpouring of anger or escape attempts, the workers of the shelter and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that such risks are raised in larger institutions like the one in the town of Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook the signs that indicate the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish \"ocupation forces\"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Mouelem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in the Syrian country, under the pronunciation of fighting terrorism and \"will be dealt with accordingly\"
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria “the war against terrorism was almost over ” – where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue \"sacred fighting until we have wiped out all Syrian terrorists -- including terrorist groups and \"every foreign presence\" --
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in charge of training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this country broken down by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there are good conditions for their return and blamed “the particulars of the Western country, to“ spread irrational fears, ” which encourage refugees not to return.
\"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns,\" he said.
\"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue,
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help restore Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last major rebel foothold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish accord has turned down a major Syrian-backed attack by Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and voiced hope that a military campaign would be launched against Jihadist and Nusra front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, which \"will be extinct,
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call the first meetings of the new committee, consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the road to the elections.
Moualem put forward the terms of the Government of Syria for participation in the work of the committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to \"the consideration of members of the current constitution\" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump to be elected second term
By that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, which many liberal viewers are likely hoping, recall and scandal have earlier interrupted his mandate.
This would undoubtedly be \"the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate of all time,
So far, there's no indication of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN channel and almost tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC exceeded cable channel rating with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with breaking news.
\"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand – said Neal Baer producer of drama \"The Chosen Survivors – on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime writer of comedy and author of the book “Only funny parts: and a few harsh truths about getting into a club called Hollywood Boys, has a different theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
“ He said, “because he makes me laugh, ” Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos also has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can decide the future of an abortion law from Roe v. Wade's trial, whether the immigrant families will be able to connect and what the state of the global economy will be.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you watched a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of “deep background ” for his book“Strech, ” about Paul Manafort’s jacket from an egg’s skin worth $15,000 (“the suit with a thick attitude of bravado ”) and the implications of picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump, given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never again see Super Maria with the same eyes.
“A part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that it feeds you every night, ” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and a show maker – Zagaonica, commenting on the rotation of the acting set and the daily complications of Trump’s show (criticism of the American football league, praise for Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of about 80 degrees (27 °C), but he shut himself in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ said Mr. Fleiss.

Large inflow of money on the side in the most uncertain mid-term election run for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the deployment of congress districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
A recent border crossing in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the elections of Democratic Representative Conora Lamba, who came to the head of the second district after an emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th-century of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were consolidated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign campaign campaign fight between the main party fund collectors, the Committee that raises funds for a democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely viewed special elections for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania in March.
A Republican held that position for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to the Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreating
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
Mr Trump had a hearty meeting in June 2017 with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varel and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the control team of the Trump organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from the EL Salvadoran, the Dominican Republic and Panama for \"strength decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore,\" said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140m in US aid in 2017, including narcotics control, developmental and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been difficult to hit this Central American country with a high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meetings advanced, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was to continue a similar meeting last year, which was a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually interrupted any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new difficult messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates on condition they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing you know, could be Detective Inspector Robert Mueller's report on the possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which now has significant evidence in the public record.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller has also directed his investigation into revealing a possible link between the campaign's Trumps and Russia's attacks to the election.
If most people change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is preparing to re-election, and perhaps even before a jury.
It's very quiet, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German soldiers were willing to strike a coup against Hitler, only to stand up to him and support the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history turns around such breaking points, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans now face multiple such breaking points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unrecognizable position since this paper reported last year that he proposed a secret recording of the president and has made speculation that he is not fit to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the report from the Times is incorrect.
\"How are we going to react if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite compelling charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, will we vote for Congress in the mid-term elections that Mr. Trump calls for responsibility?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I trust you're not gonna fall for this lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that table with a jagged cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future -

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive remi in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League.
Knee injury prevented the binding player Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the unresolved match with Villareal's final score of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for the rest of the day.
\"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent – said 31-year-old player.
\"We got into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with the point.
We may have been able to get them to the end, but everything in everything, the unresolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in second, and we were better.
We have a big European evening coming up on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a tough match because they had a good score in the last game, though, with the support of the audience, we can certainly push through and deliver a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries until the change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we've got.
The team is in good shape and the boys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope now we can continue, leave the season behind and be successful
Women can't sleep worried about saving their pension
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few have discussed it with family members.
About half of the people involved in research by Nationwide said that they discussed the long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said he talked to his children about it.
\"People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start the conversation on the subject,\" says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family and consider where and how to provide it, as such decisions can be a significant factor in price setting.
Please include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance hybrid that would help you cover those costs or provide self-saving – provided you have enough money.
Take care of your legal documents: Stop legal battles in the root.
Make the medical assistance decisions mandated so that you have an authorized person of trust who will oversee the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also signing a power of attorney for finance.
That means choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and care for paying your accounts if you remain powerless.
Remember the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is being taken to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give details in the written plan so that you will be ready.
\"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are,\" Martin asked.
\"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it.

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian town of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead are expected to grow.
As a result, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala province, areas north of the Palua, which is closer to the 7.5 degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palou.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis for the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nicl mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morrowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Pal and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia disaster relief agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on a seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesia province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the Sumatra coast.
2006: The 6.8 degree earthquake hit South Java, the most populated Indonesian island, launching a tsunami that spitted the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: A shallow earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jay in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018.: The great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily captured.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, former governor of Alaska's eldest son, and vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of violence in the family, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, a report issued Saturday by the State Police Agency of Alaska said.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit and was granted a $500 parole fee, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he raised the matter of pleas of guilt that \"it certainly wasn't his fault – the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A offenses, which means he's being sentenced to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B violations, punishable by a prison sentence of one day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time any criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing family violence and possession of alcoholic weapons related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised veteran groups in 2016 after bringing her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed after Friday's earthquake struck by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a interruption of connections and electricity supplies, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly along the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami blew up the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used the rental truck of the company Home Depot to carry out attacks on the bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, while shooting down pedestrians and bicycles that were on their way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saiov killed eight victims and “intentionally ” committed serious physical injury, according to the request for the death penalty, which was filed in the southern New York district.
On both of these points, the death penalty could be pronounced, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saip with 22 counts of murder and racketeering charges, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “silent planning and premeditation, ” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saiap carried him out as“ detestable, cruel and corrupt. ”
“Sayfulo Habibulavic Saip caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” the request for sentencing was stated.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South East District of New York last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on June 19, 1953 on the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing the Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed in the prosecution’s decision.
\"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of acquittal for the admission of guilt, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,\" Patton said.
Shaip's defense has previously requested the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has promised today to mobilize the National Army, during a protest at a Conservative Conference.
Former UK Independence Party leader said politicians had to \"feel unsatisfactory – Eurosceptics, since one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have “go out by now ” that Mr. Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May tried to unite her deep-divided ranks stressed the conservatives who advocate staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks by both supporters and opponents Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she continue her attempts to make a deal with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and laburists to choose between her package and the haos.
Mr. Bonne said at the rally going means to go to Solihullo that he wants to \"reject Chequers\"
He suggested that Mr. Farage be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.

We want to make our own laws in our country,
Mr. Bonne rejected allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely incorrect –
A supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the event, told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
\"Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening-
In a sharp note from Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when keeping their promises –

In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel unsatisfied.
“We are mobilizing the nation’s army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-involved, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, leftover supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
A few activists waved to the banners \"The Torits Against Brexit\" after the group was formed this weekend.
Laburist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.

Warren is planning on seriously considering his candidacy for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the native of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a participative meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, was running for elections in November against a Republican representative at the Geoff Diehl House, which was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's at the center of speculation so she can face Trump 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with electricians using a participative meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in the lead.
The arrest after LSU Sims was shot.
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced Saturday's arrest of a shooting suspect who killed a LSU Wade Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at a press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released, asking for help in finding the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus Southern University early Friday.
Wade Sims was shot in the head after which he died, ” said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of the weapon, and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and brought to the police station of East Baton Rouge.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two laps and calling on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton behind to engage in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel of a wheel that reluctantly forced Ferrari driver to leave the interior free with the risk of falling behind after a double move in the defense of the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race by relying on his tires to get to the speedy finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Walteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team did an extraordinary job of achieving a single or two formative finish, ” Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinsten at a rally Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president didn't deal directly with Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, evil, and lying.
The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and evil and lying, he said.
When you look at the releases and the information that was leaked to the public, and then they say, \"Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information to the public?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public- whatever?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it go.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't, \"he added, impersonating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- yet Feinsten denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release her story to the public - Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as she asked--
But her denial did not come across the approval of the president, who said at the rally Saturday night, \"Let me tell you, that was a really bad body language.\"
It may not be, but I have never seen a body language worse in my life:
By continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president has insinuated that Democrats use those allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see meanness, pragility, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, “the mediate conveys the words of the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for defeating the Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday by winning 5 to 3 in the Dundee return match on Saturday.
At the very beginning, the Giants gained the advantage of two goal hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equation before Dwyer regained the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equated for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lunvald Nielsen assured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elte League season for Adam Keef's team, who came from the back and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting in the two-party season, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwayer opened the match with a fourth-minute hit, 3:35, with Kendal McFaull's assist, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilier and doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In the crowd at the beginning, Sullivan brought his home team back into the game at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt assisted Cowney for the tie at 15:16.
Dwyer provided the first break with the lead of Giants to the second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalization in measuring the force naked at 27.37 minutes.

Air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake.
An Indonesia air traffic controller declared a hero after he died ensuring a safe take-off with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are reported missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawes on Friday, launching a tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the town of Palou.
Although his colleagues fled trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Pala, which was rocking hard.
He remained to ensure a safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time standing on the runway.
When he realized that the control tower was going down, he jumped off it.
He died later at the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our heart is breaking because of this news, “he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state-run disaster relief agency says the approach to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is believed to continue to grow as numerous bodies remain below the ruins and many cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching the height and to six metres, devastated the Palace, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Emergency vehicles are being brought in every minute.

Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is busy working to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the army of the state: I ask all of you to work daily to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? - CNN reporting.
Indonesia earlier this year hit an earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini says that after the plane crash in the Lagoon, one face is gone.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in micronesia has announced that one person is being driven missing, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a statement states that Saturday afternoon has been unable to trace the passenger.
The airline said it is working in co-operation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the traveler, such as its age or nationality.
Local vessels have helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell in water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that on Saturday six more passengers were held at the hospital and that everyone was in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew over the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to break through the emergency exit through the water that hit their waist on the plane that went down.
He said the crew were in a panic and they were yelling and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who worked nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue using the boat to blow up, which carried the passengers to the coast before the plane sank to the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that the PNG registered airline accidents have killed 111 people in the past two decades, but that none of them included Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution completed the case Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
Prior to the jury, he said he was using mobile phone data to draw up a picture of the whereabouts of defendant Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, age 19, the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was obtained with several phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his earlier claims, was transmitted by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at a time where he was, according to his own claims, with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was out of town that day.
Asking the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed Chambers met about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis had set a certain time after Chambers' death on his phone wiped out her messages, calls and contact information.
He erased her from his life, ” Hale said.
The defense should begin with a closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to take place later in the day.
What's a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has strayed from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and the Commons again gain popularity in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
The New York nanny is suing a couple for termination after a racist text message.
The New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal on a discrimination basis after having mistakenly received a text message from a mother complaining that she is another black person.
A couple deny that they're racist, judging the lawsuit as an extortion--
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was dissatisfied when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she realized that the new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
NOSE ONE MORE BLACK GIRL “Said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her husband, Mrs. Maurice sent her twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, arguing that their former nanny, who was African-American, was badly doing her job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, was quoted as New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was compensated for a day's work and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing a couple for dismissal, as well as a 350-dollar fee per day in six months, on how initially she's engaged to live with her family, though without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do things like that, ” she said for Post on Friday, adding that this is discrimination.
The couple responded to the allegations of racism that the cancellation of Mauri's engagement was reasonable because they were afraid that after they offended her, they wouldn't be able to believe her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, “he told Post husband Joel Plasco.
But would you trust your children to someone you have offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Motivating the lawsuit as extortion, “Plasco said that his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and had been in a very difficult situation,
Are you going after someone like that?
That’s not very nice, ” the investment banker added.
Although court proceedings are still under way, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behaviour and thinking.
The Paddington publishers were afraid the readers wouldn't relate to the talking bear, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put in the position of someone who reads it the first time before the publication.
It is very interesting to know what we now know about Padddington’s success –
Saying that her father, who, before the little stuffed bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She added that her father secretly was proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family –
He was a quiet man, he didn’t like to boast, ” she said.
But since Padddington was so real to him, it was almost like your child reached something and you're proud of him, even though it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself –
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
Above regularly called to say that it was bad, and that they did not expect it to survive, ” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
I did the same thing.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you, baby.\"
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep the heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just moments before that and it all went out.
I could've just sat there and waited, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered.
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for her daughter's death, boarded a plane with other passengers, who had no idea what kind of trouble she was going through.
No one knew, “she said.
I got my head down, and my tears kept running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but I was overwhelmed by my sympathy for Hope during the summer.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the Welsh Bridge set up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide at age 18.
I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day, ” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with an infectious laugh.
Everybody knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up every room.
Before he died, however, he left his job because he was in a very dark,
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says: “I’m constantly worried that this will have consequences, ” says Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know that there is someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit there and shut up - talk -
Mrs. Humpreys, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn’t say he was moody, depressed or anything, ” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything else -
She says his death for them was a huge trauma, but they have to get through it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's tearing us apart.
But we'll move on and fight

With the FBI's investigation open, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he asked for - an investigation of the limited duration and the volume - perhaps that would have brought us together somewhat, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid that it was falling apart – due to the unrelenting party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is caused by choice of the moment.
The Congress elections are taking place for only five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans go badly, their attempts to elect their man in the country's highest court are expected to be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush phoned the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, in which 51 republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It remains unclear whether Mr Cavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to decide and confirm his appointment as Supreme Court.
The number of defections from North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of defections from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
While calling for information from the South Korea Unity Ministry, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 defectes were recorded last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that the two decisive factors are a stronger control of the borders between North Korea and China and the larger tariffs people traffickers charge.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
A large majority of the refugees from the north are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flees China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the hard-protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China's defection is considered illegal migrants, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have been clearly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss suspended denucleisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, which reached a broader consensus that it would work on denucleating the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security either, and under such circumstances we do not consider being the first unilaterally disarmed, ” the RI said in its address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterics, saying that he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader at Nancy Pelosi's House called the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh hysteric – and said that because of his temperament, he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, ” Pelosi told the Senate Justice Committee about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he talked about his family and his high school age,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, estimating allegations against him by a grouse and orchestrated attack on his personality – organised by liberals angry that Hilary Clinton lost presidential elections 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform his role in the Supreme Court since it showed his bias at the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against Clinton and the Democrats, she said.
To question whether he will try to recall Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has recoiled.
I will say the following - if he is not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he is now in, ” Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the district appeals court judge of District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible Kavanaughi's verdicts against the Access Health Act or in Roe v Wade's case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether or not he would amend certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and we are expected to say if it is not wonderful, ” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justified anger, anger that has been gathering for months and years, and it cannot be solved without pay.
We cry when we are angry, ” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what you're saying.
She continued: I was helped by a woman who was somewhere as executive director, and who said that she also cries when she's angry, but that she developed a technique that understood that when she got angry and started crying, the person she would talk to, you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry.
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great.
Tears are allowed a way to get rid of anger partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office where most men were men, is that once I cried over indescribable anger, an older woman -- a cold boss that I was always a little afraid of -- grabbed my neck and pulled me out to the stairwell.
I never let them see me cry, ” she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad they think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she discovered that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
That was not a well thought - out decision, ” she said through laughter 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and seven dwarfs.
As the campaign was already up, it was behind with fundraising, so she vowed not to enter the race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
Do they think I have a discount?
When she announced in her speech that she was not going to launch an official campaign, she was so consumed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger for the chauvinism -- from which she got caught in her throat.
You would think that I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Mrs. Schroeder’s reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were gonna put on my monument?
She cried.
How can a trade war between the U.S. and China be good for Beijing
The first canonadas of the trade war between the United States and China were stifling, and until the end of the battle is yet to be seen, a conflict between countries may in the long term be beneficial for Beijing, said experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest blow occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth 200 billion pounds (150 billion pounds), which practically taxed half of all US goods coming from China.
Beijing has fought back at the same rate every time, and the latest one is the introduction of a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed that the United States will respond in the same measure, and the second largest economy in the world seems to be not stopping soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to comply with requirements, but public worshiping the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, the US's arrivals in the trade war can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a steep economic decline in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed, ” said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia in the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is crying for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation in the field is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress of the fight against terrorism, “he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
Since the beginning of the war, the UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be welcome to help rebuild the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that have aided the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US final score of 16,5 to 10,5 in the field of Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown while Danish captain Thomas Björn's team won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling all over the tournament, threw the ball in the water with a start ball on the 16th hole pair 3, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliantly in all rounds, and became one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since 1997 started in this format.
The American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked European team player.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Pauler from England to whom this may have been the last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 career points won.
I don't normally cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the Cup again.
Here is an important team, and I am glad I could be of help, ” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
The baton teaches his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golf player Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in single matches on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud of beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man, ” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 on the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 biggest titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find its way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US captain Jim Furyk said, \"I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there were moments when we gave resistance to Europe.
We failed.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll be working with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder Cups, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're outplayed,
