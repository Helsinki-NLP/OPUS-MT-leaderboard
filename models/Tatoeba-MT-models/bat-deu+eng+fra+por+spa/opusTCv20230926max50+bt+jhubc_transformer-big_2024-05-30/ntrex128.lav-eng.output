Welsh Assembly Members (AM) worried about 'being perceived as embarrassment'
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
In the entire political spectrum, AM is worried that this could make them a subject of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's AM explained that their group is concerned about "rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "monkey", and "pwp" means "kaka".
The party Plaid AM said that none of the group was "unsatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party of Wales admitted that their group was ready to consider changing the name, but added that "MWP" very much resembles "Muppet", which means "Amb".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently working on a bill to change the name, said: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate members of the Assembly must, of course, be made by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a proposal for the results of the public consultation, which gained broad support for the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the AM, the commission preferred the "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
It is important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but it is not the case in the United States.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on what they will be called will take place after they have discussed the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country will change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour gives the impression of claiming its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply something to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silenced as the churches of Harlem fight for their existence.
"According to the old people I've talked to, earlier there was a bar and a church at every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood, which people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he worries that the money received from selling properties will end sooner than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will have returned to their starting point."
The churches, he added, will probably be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties that will accommodate people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"The majority of people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will approach when these churches will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who will buy these apartment properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the White Congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation who had worshiped God nearby.
The black congregation of St. Martin's church took over his blessings during the time of John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Haarlem, who had refused to hire or promote the blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson’s congregation was planning to rebuild the building, they ordered a bell game.
His blessing, David Johnson, the son and successor of his father, the congregation of St. Martin, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor people."
The expert, who played this bell game in July, used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather told us that the congregation of St. Martin did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s church reflected the tangled relationship between architects and contractors, some of whom were attracted to the secular power and others to the episcopal diocese of the church.
The Council of the Church, composed of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the Council, although the Council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocesan work.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old in Lobster Fishing Area
A shark on Saturday in California attacked a 13-year-old boy who drew on lobsters and wounded him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV San Diego that he and his friends had been in a nirry for about half an hour on Saturday morning when they heard the boy crying for help, and then ran up to him with the group to help pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a delight to catch a lobster, but then he "realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I'm bitten!"
The whole of his keybone was torn," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I scream for everyone to leave the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to the Rady (Rady) Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the media in a briefing that the shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was acknowledged that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was injured in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for security reasons.
Jails said there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most were not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's goes on the assault on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of department store-style beauty shelves and trained sellers.
As part of the significant investment in the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite declining sales of fashion and home items, 11 stores in the country will be testing larger rows of beauty shelves and, if successful, there will be more next year.
In the beauty industry, investments are made when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use shelves that were previously dedicated to televisions, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty offering for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in Boots stores, for example.
The supermarket is also re-placing its "Boutique" line of make-up, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, perfume wholesaler Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to small grocery shopping every day in local stores mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that retail outlets will become more and more like department stores as a chain of stores tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has hosted Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is alleged to have improved sales and made the purchase more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the union collapsed after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds of pharmacy stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy evolves after Sainsbury's sold its 281-storey pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to this plan, the task of "Lloyds" will be to supplement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay"and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "To improve the environment for buyers, we have redesigned the look of our beauty products rack rows and how they make an impression.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment combined with a convenient location means that we are now a delightful goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges current shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'full of rage' after Holly Willowby abandons <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Peter Jones was filled with rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby dropped a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby does not have time to dedicate to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The pair's business was compared to the "Goop" brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
"This Morning" the 37-year-old show host used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has abandoned the Dragons Den star Peter Jones in anger as she quit their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "full of rage" when a TV golden girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million mean she no longer has time to devote to her homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared to the "Goop" brand of Gwyneth Platrow, and, according to the hint, it will double the wealth of Willowby, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willowby (37) used Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
As the source tells us, “Truly was the most important of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would be devoted to the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlowe there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that leaving This Morning, one of the most financially profitable stars, can cost the company millions because of the huge amount of money invested in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and home goods, and further delays in launching them.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willowby "Truly" was formed together with Kep in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV producer firm.
Willowby has to become a brand M&S messenger, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" director.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business dealings!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies for a comment that some may consider “inappropriate for the president” and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has the president given up so much?
Trump said in his fictional voice of the "news narrator".
"I didn't give up on anything!"
He said Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump acknowledged their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a US "response" to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, including stopping missile testing, helping to release prisoners and returning the remaining American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to make the impression of a president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this heavily populated area, we have 200 here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to initiate foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, on many occasions they made it very clear that they were not asking for international help, so this is a certain problem," said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children gathers a group to go to Palo, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the regularity of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for the fury of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been set up in Aceh, they are rarely found along other shores.
It is likely that the deaths were also influenced by the fact that the tsunami warning sirens did not sound in Palu, despite the warning being valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital, which had been anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now heading to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new scourge.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure the centrepiece of his electoral campaign, and he had earmarked large sums for roads and railways.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been tormented by a lack of funds and he will be re-elected next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to deal with a longstanding problem caused by tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring at the 89th minute of Saturday's Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri at about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea gate when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then kicked the ball in the direction of the farthest gate post.
In this attempt, the ball flew high over the pitch, reaching the upper right corner of the grid.
The ball eventually fled over the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible for myself," Starridge explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touching the ball, and, without much thought, hitting."
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of the European Union (EU) or the United Kingdom (EU).
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before turning to the middle of the field and throwing himself into the Liverpool field as fast as possible.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
Then he made a beautiful kick between the players, letting Azard get into the zone.
Azard beat the defensive speed and completed the combination by hitting the far-post net with his left leg, passing Liverpool by Alison Becker.
Liverpool will compete with Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the Champions League group stage in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea and Videoton will meet in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami in Indonesia kills 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in debris after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police suspected of stabbing a 32-year-old man
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found with stitch wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people to apply in the area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something in their car camcorders, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, according to police, they are working to inform the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Gracemount, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He couldn’t say a word when he found out what had happened.
It will take hours for residents to be informed that they will be allowed to return.
A policeman told a man that the whole area was perceived as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene of the crime.
She continues to repeat, "It's so awful!".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one was placed right next to it outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC by September 30, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 at 247.
Cromwell's statue in parliament becomes the latest "history rewriting" scandal
It would be ethically justified to abandon it, given the Taliban-like activities that led to the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious monuments by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "nonsense" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become the target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor executed the destruction of sacred images during the English civil wars.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived a century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s glorious depiction of Cromwell’s view of the 19th century is part of the historiography of a person that many believe is still worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many - probably more than he is today at the end of the 19th century - as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue on whether this is really a perfectly accurate description of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality that represents one of the sides of the division of that time.
It is worth commemorating and commemorating his achievements as the protector of lords."
Pig murdered to death by peasant in China
According to local media, a pig in a market in south-west China attacked a farmer and killed him.
The man — only his surname Yuan is mentioned — was found dead with a ruptured artery, all in one blood at a pig barn on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farm is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in a pig barn in Xining, Qinghai Province in China.
He and his cousin were reported to have arrived Wednesday from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the door of the nearby pig barn was open.
He told me that there was a large male pig in the pig barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound (<0x7E>249 kg) venom had been torn by a peasant.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," he said, referring only to his surname Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera material showed how Yuan entered the market at about 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the venom was turned on to prevent it from attacking others while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to information, Yuan's family and market management discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other attacks of pigs on humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man at their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
10 years ago, a 650-pound (<0x7E>295 kg) pig in Wales held a farmer against a tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After farmers ate his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “gunshot.”
"They're just playful.
They like to bite, they are very curious ... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of Hurricane Rose brings vast and powerful rain in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa will weaken as it crosses the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood-causing rainfall in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
At five o'clock in the afternoon (North American East Time), Rosa's wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure depression is formed over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the east coast of the United States. With the force of a tropical storm approaching the peninsula of Baja California, on Monday it will begin to push the moisture masses deep from the tropical zone northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa on Monday will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain in part of Mexico.
Tropical humidity, in interaction with the approaching low-pressure depression, will then create a large area of strong rainfall in the south-west in the next few days.
1-4 inches (<0x7E>2.6-10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep moisture from the tropical zone will cause rainfall, which will reach 2-3 inches (<0x7E>5.1 to 7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5,2–10,1 cm).
Sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall is possible.
It is highly undesirable to walk in the desert because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Strong rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local raging winds and sandstorms.
A low-pressure depression will bring local heavy rain to the coastline of South California as it approaches.
Rainfalls of more than half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm) are possible and may cause slight mud flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainfall during the wet season.
Separate scattered tropical rainfall in Arizona will begin to approach late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain will take over a wider area late Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread in the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as temperatures in the Arctic are decreasing, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperatures in the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days will try to form and expand the long-lasting summer heat.
It is expected that the beginning of October will be warm in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) and above in vast areas from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that temperatures in the east of the United States will exceed the average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Caveno case
More than 20 million people watched with enthusiasm on Thursday six television channels, according to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political tie continued, with broadcasters suspending regular broadcasts to report on the latest developments on Friday: an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno was drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kaveno zealously testified that he was absolutely convinced that this was not the case.
It’s also a good time to start a new business.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded average viewer interest.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, which demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting people watching what's going on in the offices.
To get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of viewers of the playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have resolutely supported the appointment of Kaveno, had the highest number of viewers, with an average of 5.69 million during the whole daytime hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS raised 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team announced that he would vote for the appointment of Caveno, the senator spotted the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he, accompanied by protesters' indignation, tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee hearings.
In a live CNN broadcast, he stood for several minutes with his eyes pierced, as if pricked.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "You own the power, as long as so many women are powerless."
Flake explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was informed that he had more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters broadcast what was happening several hours later, as the Committee on Legal Affairs was preparing to vote on nominating Kaveno for a vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Koons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
The choice of Flake was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, right next to her on the front page of the newspaper, May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain's future relationship with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "absolutely absurd".
The shooting of Type Sims: Police Arrest Dieton Simpson Suspected of Murdering an LSU Player
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of a child who has been born in the United States for a long time.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and charged with a second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police station said.
The officials released a video showing Sims’ clash with Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson’s blood on them.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
He was charged with a security deposit of <0x24>350,000, according to his lawyer.
A team of forensic experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a provisional conclusion that the death was caused by a shot in the head that struck the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana Police Refugee Operations Team, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement officers of the territory for their "stress and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-inch (<0x7E>1.98 m) long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug does not cause any side effects, but it can also cause serious side effects.
"That's what people always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ashes rising from the Pocatello volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano after the crater was active and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre observed multiple shaking and trembling.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields in the area of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed the activation of a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police Conflict with Catalan Separatists Before Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with public order police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked secessionists, hampered by the public order police, threw eggs on them and shed powdery paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements erupted later that day, and policemen used stacks to prevent fighting.
Several hours of pro-independence groups, chanting "Do not forget and do not forgive!", were involved in the confrontation with pro-unity protesters who chanted "Long life to Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during protests.
A year after the 1 October referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid but praised by the Catalan people, the idea of independence remains under great tension in the region.
Voters strongly spoke out for independence, although voter turnout was low and those opposed to the secession boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region and violent clashes broke out.
Independence groups had been on duty Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose another path.
Narcisso Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents’ eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped,” he said.
Although parties in favour of Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a slight but significant majority, they have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as some of the best-known leaders have either emigrated or are imprisoned awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who was on the phone to support police, said the conflict was fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"Tensions are getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year, said he would stand as a candidate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Candidating in the European elections is the best way to unmask the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has imposed on us," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after hitting a building with a car
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after a car was hit several times against a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
It is possible that the car was fired simultaneously from a crossbow.
Menga's blow lets Livingston win the Rangers with 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
Livingston stunned the Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 Ibrox manager games.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be decisive, as Gary Holt's team leveled the situation with the Hibernian.
Gerard's team has not won this championship season, and next Sunday they have to meet the leader "Hearts", from which they are lagging eight points behind.
It’s also a good time to start a new business.
In the meantime, Livingston extended their series to six games without losses in the division, and head coach Holt still hasn’t tasted the defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses an opportunity against dull guests
Holt's team with their live game, which made it difficult for the Rangers in many ways, had to be in the lead long before they got the names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow's attempt to slip into his legs to delay Craig Halkett's head-to-head hit across the gate line failed.
The hosts allowed the "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that's how the decisive gate came to be.
The Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston used the corridor, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson united to give a chance to Meng, who beat and scored in the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers managed the ball, but the guards turned out to be unstoppable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the goal.
It was the agility of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, that interrupted Scott Pitman's attempt, and Litgow threw aside the Livingston.
Centred balls continued to appear in the Livingston area, but two appeals to sentence were rejected after Halkett fought for the ball with alternate Glenn Middleton and for playing by hand.
"The Phantom" "Livingston" performance - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni arena of the Scottish BBC
A phenomenal "Livingston" performance and score.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to surpass expectations, constantly improving performance.
Their style of play and personalities haven’t changed since their return to the highest echelon, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has teamed the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at maintaining a first-class defense, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were always vigilant.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard, they were far from those standards.
Their last ball was boring—only once they broke into a part of the hosts' square—and it's basically an invitation to wake up "Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is greeted in Cologne with divided feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there were a lot of smiles and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people for security reasons, preventing them from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, mostly Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him.
The protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by a guest, some of whom see the German Turk as a hero, while others despise him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car collision in London.
The clash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a section of the road with heavy traffic in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and the help was provided by the medical staff, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of a Sunday collision, when the driver left the scene.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
Roads are closed and buses are diverted, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Employees Injured During Unrest
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were wounded in riots in a men's hard-hitting prison.
The riots broke out at the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and continue.
In order to prevent disturbances involving eight prisoners and enclosed in one wing, employees of the special service "Tornado" were involved
Employees were treated for mild facial injuries at the site of the event.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "In order to resolve the HMP Long Lartin prison incident, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six staff members were given medical treatment for injuries.
We will not accept violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was being treated in the hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, employees responsible for controlling the depression were sent to prison to resolve the serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiard bombs.
Hurricane Rose Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by sudden floods (possibly benefiting drought-stricken areas)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert southwest with the remaining force, posing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with rain late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depressions within a radius of 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching as much as 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other desert areas in the south-west, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54-5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to benefit, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the route of Hurricane Rose leads to the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rosa is still in a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 kilometers) per hour, lying about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 kilometers) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 kilometers) per hour.
The storm encounters cooler Pacific waters and therefore calms down.
Therefore, the hurricane is expected to reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning with the force of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in Mexico can be severe, with a significant risk of flooding.
"The rainfall is expected to reach 3-6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from Lower California inside the south-western part of Sonora, the precipitation is expected to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and reach the south of Utah on Tuesday late at night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is very strong rainfall in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Orca Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods and mudflows in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stitch wounds was found in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
Police said the 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.

Trump says Kaveno suffered from 'evil and anger' of the Democratic Party
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the Democrat Party's cruel and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno had suffered from the Democratic Party's "evil and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno gave testimony before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "the people of America saw Caveno's excellence, ability, and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Caveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history in serving the nation," he told supporters in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the nomination in a round-the-clock discussion on the importance of Republican activity in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not a candidate, but in fact I am a candidate," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump said Democrats had taken on the mission of "protesting and resisting".
The first vote in the Senate on Caveno’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the Republican party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is rising
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away as gigantic waves hit the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves hit the shore in a twilight, sweeping many to death and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami erupted after a 7.5-billion-strong earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indian disaster agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it was destroying everything on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
"Many people climbed trees to save themselves and survived," he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs taken by the disaster agency on the flight show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
After the shootings, the coastal city continued to shake on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency BPPT said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have exacerbated the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's damage was described as "extensive" and reported to have collapsed thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"The communications were completely destroyed, there was no information from Dongal," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
"Already it's a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, despite officials claiming that the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In a social media video, a man on the top floor of a building desperately calls people on the street below that a tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall strikes the shore, washing away buildings and machines.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was genuine.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power, which cut off communications in Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army had started sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other essentials.
The city airport is open only for assistance activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
That is very bad.
Mr. Doseba told us that the World Vision staff, who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Donggala and now live in tarpaulin sheds in the office yard, passed through the scenes of damage on the way.
"They told us that they saw many buildings that were destroyed," he explained.
That is very bad.
Even when relief teams resolutely started organizing relief for disaster victims, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to travel to Palos.
According to Indonesian law, overseas organizations' funding, resources and personnel will only be allowed to arrive if the area of the disaster is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
"When the government announces, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international assistance, but that status has not yet been determined."
When Palu arrived on the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of still undiscovered people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that brighten up the gloomy life of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paraglider team, had prepared two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which took place this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am taught by the burden of emotions."
Mr. Gendon remembered that after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread in the paraglaze team, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages for hours to the Pali race participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one gray mark, not two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 while filling ATM at Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning after filling up an ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was ready to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man "runned to the Brink's employee from behind" and stole his bag with ATM money.
According to the press release, the witnesses noticed several suspicious persons who left the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Je
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye (Ye).
Announcing his replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Baby, who previously knew as Kanji West."
41-year-old West has been called Je for some time and used the nickname as the name of his eighth album, which was published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The creators of the show say that he replaces singer Arian Grand in the show, who stopped his work for "emotional causes".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but also has a religious meaning.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one," followed by "Ye," which is a reflection of the good and the bad in us, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesta, has both used a dashboard and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody retribution of students approaches.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Army units fired on a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a leading country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A two-fold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so lagging behind in the U.S., and the next milestone in artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the chances of the next AI breakthrough in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures and has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would outperform America's best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was Microsoft Research CEO and President of Google China Branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be ready to identify people with ideas for the future.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"It is not China that attracts leading scientists, but big companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
He added that a change in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should automatically be given to people with a PhD in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
Lee explained that China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the U.S. Department of Defense's Central Research and Development Organization) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonian Republic" as a step to avoid decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that the name of its northern neighbor suggests claims to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised concerns about whether the turnout will reach at least the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation such as an EU and NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian youth so that they can live freely, under the guise of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgiyevsky in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
To change the name, a 2/3 majority will be needed in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no irregularities had been reported until one afternoon.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko handed over their votes in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of tents that had been laid by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with the head raised, not through the door of servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev says NATO membership will trigger the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote in favour, because more than 80"percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telema TV found that 57 percent of voters planned to vote in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50 percent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City Sergio Aguero spearheads through all the Brighton defense to score
If you’re not sure what to do, you’re probably not sure what to do, but if you’re not sure what to do, then you’re probably not sure what to do.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal score in the 65th minute was ridiculously light.
The Argentinean forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the hand.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and ran into the free field.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He beat the ball to one of the defenders, then beat several more at the edge of the Brighton field.
He then made a left pass, reaching Sterling.
The English center attacker used his first touch to pass back to Agvero, who used the right football boot to beat the Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by hitting the ball on the right side of the grid.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
Goals were scored in the 29th minute.
Agvero plays the ball off deep into the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball along the caviar of the left leg of Leroy Sane with a beautiful kick.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
The attacker of the Sky Blues Center gently dropped the ball into the grid just before crossing the border.
"City" will compete against "Hoffenheim" in the Champions League group games on Tuesday at 12.55 pm on Tuesday at the "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinshaima, Germany.
Shercer wants to cause problems for the Rockies
As the Nationals did not participate in the playoffs, there was no reason to reopen.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take a chance against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies have an up-to-date playoff game. And the Rockies in the National League West group are in the lead with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States and the United States.
"Although we play the same way, at least we can have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most damaging I'm going to face this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, according to reports, are ready to let Shercer take the shot.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of the European Union (EU) or the United Kingdom (EU).
The Washington right hand is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes at 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rallies in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation in which his chosen candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kaveno entered, at the same time talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in interim elections.
“In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious - I'm not a candidate, but in fact I'm a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump added: “You see this terrible, awful group of radical Democrats acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, disgusting action.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have taken on the mission of "protesting and resisting".
"And you yourselves have seen it in the last four days," he stressed, calling the democrats "angry, evil, nasty and false."
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic Party Senator of the Senate Justice Committee, to whom the audience responded with loud crying.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what is it about?
No, hmm, wait — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant to the exposed
It was not surprising that the Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to be censored.
After all, I am so far the last in a row of Labour MPs who were informed that he was not desirable — all because we do not hide our views.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It is ironic about the importance of an economically responsible policy, about national security, about Europe, but these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement on the Labour meeting in the east of Nottingham said on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during my eight local Labour parliamentary careers were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and promises of a "kinder, more gentle" policy have long been forgotten, if at all, ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues who I think we share our political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would not otherwise have agreed to, be it national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly -- and it really doesn't matter what I say -- there's a tyranny about using social media, calling for a ban on running in the next elections, exposing the centre's policies, claiming that I don't have a seat in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are confronted every day with a stream of sexist and racist insults, but who never try to obey.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation ready for a diversity of views, and with every mistrust or change in the rules of selection, the party shrinks.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised not to jump on the harrows, to think what I am talking about, and then I will be okay.
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a pupil, in response to the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set the task of fighting for better public services for those who need them most – both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never hid my political views, nor have I in previous elections.
There was no reason for anyone in the east of Nottingham to doubt my position on political issues and in areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
To those who pushed the proposal on Friday, I can only say that, at a time when the country is moving resolutely towards the Brexit to the detriment of households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a willingness to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically, the only thing I want to say is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of exclusion or reminding you that nothing is indispensable in politics will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unsaid Ayr reaches top line in table
The last two attempts may have shattered the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of 10.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and the much better use of the opportunities that guided the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we're not defeated yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: "With all due respect for Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo raised Ayr, but the yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where he was awarded the Warriors, changed the Melrose numbers, and Jason Begott did not.
If you want to know more about this, you can contact us by phone or e-mail: info<0x40>ayr.com.
But Melrose started half the time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Begot reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break, because Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and taken away from the field on a stretcher, but when the game resumed "Ayr" quickly moved forward when Stafford McDowall made a rehearsal, which was carried out by the Climate.
Ayr's Captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, under intense pressure, Melrose used an unwanted player, with Bruce Colvine's attempt, which was not realized.
However, the hosts clashed, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty corridor, McPherson made a tach-down on the back of the Ayr Pier.
Klimo executed the ball, as before, almost from the restart itself after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong on the kick-off field and sent Flank player Gregor Henry to his fifth attempt.
“Still Game” star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems to be planning to enter the hospitality business after it turned out that he is named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he composes and participates with his longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the final of the show, and Kirnan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kirnan planned to engage in Glasgow's "booming restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The seamen patroll around the navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Navy base ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the memories of Chile’s 19th-century bloody conflict over the lost coastline of resources are still alive, as are the longings for a return to the Pacific.
These expectations have probably been at their highest since several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's judgment on 1 October after five years of review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in spirit, and of course it is waiting for a result with positive thoughts," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivarians will be watching the International Court's verdict on big screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile be obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, awaiting a controversial re-election battle next year, is also very interested in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to regaining the Pacific Ocean," he excited at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court’s ruling in favour of Bolivia is unlikely, and if it were to be adopted, no major changes would be expected.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory, and its representatives have said that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice is handed down just six months after the final hearing suggests that the case was "not complicated," explained Paz Zárate, an international regulatory expert from Chile.
And the last four years have not moved Bolivia's case forward, but on the contrary, have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales's militant rhetoric has suppressed the remaining goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once again continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to keep the discussion going.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and "to put an end to 139 years of conflict, which will benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used maritime problems as political cops.
"Bolivie will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to realize what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will not give up nuclear weapons until the U.S. can rely on them
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared ready to resume deadlocked diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says they are "fantasies" to hope that the US's continued sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War will ever cause North Korea to kneel down.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang undertakes substantial disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up arms, which the state probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim’s next meeting with Trump.
The Paris fashion show introduces the latest massive headdress line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced the audience to a series of absurd, huge headwear items in the spring/summer 2019 collection, which dazzled against the background of the style defined by the Paris Fashion Week.
The most impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to display fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding work was a gorgeous beige hat decorated with feathers and a wide edge that swallowed his head.
The massive accessories included gemstone-covered watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple —but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn on the lips, and they were more suitable for Hannibal Lecter than for the high fashion.
One of the formations resembled a breathing mind for diving, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then it's time.
Style spectators believe that huge aubes are probably on their way to your nearest High Street.
Oversized hats immediately became popular after La Bomba appeared — straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide sides seem to have worn all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very impractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another big thing on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit-dressed model carrying it.
The red-yellow raffia bag, decorated with a raffia fringe and equipped with a white leather handle, occupied a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" spring/summer 2019 collection for the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in central business street stores next summer because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions and have retained it in 2018, once again with excellent exam results, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other public events.
These schools, which have a total of 30 000 students in Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of education for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement specific school curricula, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it remains in his heart."
It is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Recent results of this year's exams show that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest number of exams passed in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
According to the Scottish Independent Schools Board of 74 schools, 72 percent of students scored the highest grade A in Chinese, and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language, as an optional subject, is now regarded in independent school curricula as high as the subjects of the group of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited lack of language skills as reasons for failure to fill vacancies.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly becoming a prerequisite to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increasing job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will give them the real advantage of such a long-term skill in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multilingual learner.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to sustain a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit equivalent number of people, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Skills in several languages, especially in developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for Britain’s future, according to plans for 2020.
Whatever interests your child, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages and teachers will be experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "skills for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent School Council
Is it possible to get rid of this disease in the first place?
It’s the first time we’ve seen the Los Angeles Lakers play LeBron’s first game.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But it remains to be decided exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Walton told the Lakers official website.
The reporter of the Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As a follow-up to his practice this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-season pre-season series.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallyes today in Villinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump-planned rallyes next week, including a stop in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his decision to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's goal is to win support in the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after voting in November.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
Trump's rally in Villing, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m., after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Trump is expected to talk about this week's hearing in the case of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kaveno, which has been strained by sex offences, and a vote in the Senate is expected to postpone approval for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of the rally is to help improve the situation for Republicans awaiting elections in November.
As a result, President Trump's campaign shows that the five-meetings next week's task is "to activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will visit as much of the state as possible because we are starting a working campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to disclose his name told Reuters.
This evening's meeting, which is planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Villinga, is likely to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be featured in the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrison that the president should come to help improve his results in the polls," Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Raiders Cup 2018: US demonstrates determination to fight to keep high hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions in "one word" Wednesday afternoon game in "foursome" format was probably exactly what this Raiders Cup needed.
Athletes love to talk about success fluctuations, and they really believe that, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side do they think success is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think that in a way means that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth on his way.
The European Union is, of course, preferred, as it is in the lead with 4 points, and 12 more will be played out.
Spit explained that the Americans believe that the wind is blowing in their sails and they have reason to be optimistic, including, of course, in the person of Spitz and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast three points out of four.
The spit has been destructive from the place of the first blow to the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
Those gutular win-calls became more and more loud as his round continued, and a decisive kick in the pit was made to achieve four times the same number of kicks when he and Thomas were behind by two kicks after two.
His beating into the pit, which led to their victory in 15 , was perceived by a similar cry, from them, for his belief that the American team has not yet been pushed out.
"It's really necessary to dig deep, and worry about your match," Spitz said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes for luck.
The only players who have scored more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raiders Cup.
The weird but attractive European couple lags behind by four points and will not be able to harm.
Mollywood was the only couple to live without a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This process and the way their energy flows to and back into this raging crowd convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Fleetwood and Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with this morning's hero in the format of "fourballs" Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Boggy and the two doubles in the front nine led the Spaniards and the Swedes into trouble, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you cope.
In the fourball and foursome formats, it's so exciting to watch around because of the couples' interactions, to see what tips they give and what they don't give, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is far in the lead before the last day, but this race in foursome format showed that the U.S. team is determined to fight for which many, especially the Stateside, are in doubt.
Is it possible to get rid of the disease in the first place?
The European team will start the final day of the Raiders Cup in a pleasant lead after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" races ended in a lead with 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two victories over hard-working Tiger Woods, who raised Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team to save the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago dominated over the inaccurate American team in the morning race in the format of "fourballs", and the result of the series became 3-1.
The United States resisted foursomes more vigorously, winning two matches, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
The team of Jim Furyk needs 8 points in Sunday 12 singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first to score four consecutive points with Mollywood, known as Mollywood after a sensational weekend, and is only the second pair in Raiders Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they then easily defeated the tired Wood and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more compassionate score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, scored a great game at times, but he has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games in the fourballs, returning to partner Henrik Stenson's foursomes to defeat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who ranked first and second in the world rankings.
Europe was unable to reach its full potential, despite a pleasant day in the south-west of Paris and a light breeze.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
They squeezed 2&1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 foursomes after losing their first two holes.
Only twice in the Raiders Cup history, the team has played back 4 points in the deficit singles, but as the owners, the Farik (Furyk) team only has a tie result to save the trophy.
After staying in the second place for two days, as it seems, Sunday counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States and that North Korea would never unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear weapons and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging never to disseminate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate US response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the well-known reproaches of North Korea over Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, whereby Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement left an impression as it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a meeting in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards “the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
"The United States insists that "denuclearance must come first" and raises the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve the goal by force, even opposing a "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could push us to our knees is an empty fantasy cherished by people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not talk about his intentions for Kim’s second meeting with Trump, which the US leader specifically mentioned in his speech to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister specifically highlighted three Kim meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side in this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a deadlock."
Ri's speech, however, drastically differed from what he said last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after "Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that much remains to be done and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not planned a specific timetable, stressing that “it doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its work.
But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously without mistakes until a final and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to end the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but only a few hours later he was accused by North Korea of "gangster-worthy demands."
North Korea, at a meeting with Muna this month, pledged to dismantle the weaponry site and the nuclear facility if the US took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students will learn a subject about how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard this year has made students sleep more, and it is an attempt to address the increasingly popular culture of brutality that involves overcrowding with caffeine all night long.
One teacher found that students at the world’s best university often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject after speaking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and asked, 'Why am I only being told this now that I'm in the last grade?'
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep -- what surprised me, he told Telegraph.
This year’s first subject, which is released for the first time, provides students with basic information on how good sleeping habits contribute to learning and sporting achievements, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce a training course after finding out that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the training week.
The lesson-long training process includes a series of interactive exercises.
One of the parts is a dormitory door image, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how smoking will affect your health," added Professor Chaysler.
He said that a culture of overnight learning still exists, and added that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exertion and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain because lack of sleep turns the brain into fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaysler develop the subject after attending one of his lectures last year, Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course accessible to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request to students who have obtained a postgraduate education to master a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaseler advises students to install an alarm clock not only when they wake up, but also when they go to sleep, as well as keep in mind how people are harmed by the “blue lights” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, as they can disrupt circadian rhythms, making it difficult to fall asleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's gate overturns Gerard's men
The Rangers were hit by another sad game when Dolly Menga's beating Steven Gerrard's confused team scored 1 - 0 against Livingston.
The Ibrox hoped to win their first outing since February 4:1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became the club's manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader, the Hearts.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
The Rangers fall to the sixth place, while the Livingston climbs to the third place, and only Hibernian beats it in terms of goal difference.
And the Rangers may have another problem, because the judge's assistant, Calum Spence, needed medical attention due to a head injury, apparently caused by a distant end-thrown object.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind Ayr, reaching the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players who took one point away from the Hearts last week, and he would be happy how his well-trained team suppressed opponents in each episode.
The Rangers probably managed the ball more often, but Livingston made better use of what they were doing.
They were supposed to score two minutes after Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor gate, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs' free kick reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to shoot the ball far past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but they had the impression that the game was expected in the last third, rather than expected to happen.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt he should have made a penalty shot in the 15th minute after he had collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian call.
The Rangers made only two shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot or the modest end of Ovie Ejaria's attack.
If you’re not sure what to do, you’re probably not sure if you’re going to be able to do it.
"Rangers"already again did not cope with Jacobs' planned long combination.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Meng for a simple ending.
In a break, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly immediately rushed to block.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play as they liked, with Litgov and Halkett making one long kick after another.
Holt's team could have continued to take the lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgow made a headshot from the corner.
The Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton late in the game demanded another penalty kick after he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who grew up to be a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately resulted in a device known as a Geiger meter.
The Geiger counter, which has taken and preserved its place in science, has also taken its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans played the main roles.
Man: "What the fuck is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you'll be able to hear the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity produced by these minerals."
Evans: "Really, it really flies!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him continues to live.

The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system how to recognize evil cells experienced that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the patient's immune cells, converting them into a laboratory so that they can ‘see' the protein HER2, which is typical for a number of tumours, and then injecting them back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumors," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectum cancers, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are extracted from the patient to be ‘teached' how to attack cancer cells, has been effective in one type of leukaemia.
After visiting SNL, Kanye West, dressed in a maga hat, attacked Trump’s critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was whispered at the Saturday Night Live show after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand for the 2020 presidential election.
After finishing the third song that night, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore the "Make America Great" hat, he began slapping loud phrases about Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee over the allegation of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the material on social media with Vesta’s complaints.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West like that.
And West complained to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headscarf.
"They mocked me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head!"
They mocked me!
And they said that I had lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?" and promised to put on "your Superman cloak," because that means you can't tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
“Try love!”
The Variety reported that his comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, but the members of the show's team looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press: "There was complete silence in the studio."
The wedding was invited at the last minute to replace singer Arianna Grande, who had a deceased friend, rapper Max Miller, a few days ago.
Vests confused many with the song (I Love it) he performed in the costume of a bottle of champagne.
The ceremony was supported by Conservative group TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the strongest people in the spirit: PLEASE THAT YOU DON'T AGREE TO PUSA!"
But talk show leader Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West was simply "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art') who I believe supports and bargains with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he had now become a "being previously known as Kanji West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "stage artist, formerly known as Prince".

A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting a murder after he was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service (Public Prosecution Service).
"Throne Games" star Kit Harrington turns against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known as swordsman John Snow in HBO's fierce medieval fantasy series "Games of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters often make young boys on the screen think that they should be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit explained that he thought there was a “problem” and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he cares about the problem.
“I can’t help thinking about the mistakes we’ve made with masculinity right now,” he said.
"What do we teach young men in this aspect of the problem as they grow up in view of the existing problem?"
Kit believes that television with its highly masculine characters is probably partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "What is innate, and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be treated like men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any sequel to the Game of Thrones after the show ended next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and the horses are fed up".
Starting in November, Kits will play the lead role in the restored Sam Shepard's "True West", which is the story of a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rosa the best thing that happened to him as a result of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, because it in a way secured my present family and my life from then on," he said.
Rosa's Emmy Award-winning fantasy series featured Igriti, a favorite of Kita's Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie’s family’s Scottish estate.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, which indicates a change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in the Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, sharply targeting "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday denied allegations that her staff member had posted personal information from three Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were disseminated by the ultra-right wing and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters insisted on Twitter.
The leaked information is reported to include residence addresses and telephone numbers owned by US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown congressman, while a Senate group held a hearing on the charges of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Breta Kaveno, nominated for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Caveno.
Conservative, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Waters Cabinet, and revealed information about the Waters staff member, Hills said.
"This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and totally a lie!" insisted Waters.
“An employee of my staff whose identity, personal information and security is compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false claim is in no way responsible for the leakage of information.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and totally a lie!"
Waters’ announcement soon sparked online criticism, including of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleisher.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not match that of a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, that person should not be angry.
He must not be a warrior.
He may not comment on the motives of the accuser.
He has to be calm and calm."
The task of Freisher was to compare the reaction of Waters with that of a Democrat who fell for Judge Cavenno, who was accused of being too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to get Waters to lose her seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her cabinet had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits are identified," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous work for any of my staff."
"Johnny Anglis 3" review - Rowan Atkinson's spy movie parody left in the semi-circle
It has become customary to look for associations with Brexit in every new film with British flavors, and this seems to apply to this one, which has revived Johnny English's parodic adventure comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with "Johnny Angli" and was reborn with the bird in 2011 with "Johnny Anglis returns".
Is the satirical satire of ourselves, of how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Angle, with his eyes swollen and his unusually moving face, has the right to create a mess after his second resurrection—his name more than anything else signals that he is a wide-ranging comic character designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He's, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his odd claims of delightful sophistication, is a little Cluzo, a little Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the guy who plays one of the Chariots of Fire theme music at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also based on the traveler and international, incomprehensible character Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos on his way.
There are at least one or two lovely moments in Johnny English's latest adventure.
I liked the place where Johnny Angles went to the helicopter in a medieval armor, and the blades of the propeller shook against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comic impression is well visible, but humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially since "serious" film brands like "007" and "Mission Impossible" themselves confidently use comedy as one of their components.
Humor gives the impression that it's dedicated to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny English's absurd misfortunes are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's dumb movie tricks in Bean's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has hacked into Britain’s supersecret spy network, uncovering the identities of all British agents in the field, to the detriment of an active agent, a miserably small role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and conflict-ridden person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best with characters that are partly similar to Theresa May, but there is not much to work with in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers say that since all the active spies have become public, she will have to call someone already retired.
And this man is Johnny England, who now works as a teacher in a subtle educational institution, and obeys to teach how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because he offers to learn the profession of a spy from the ground up.
The coal is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is merged with his former many-victim assistant Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character that becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Majesty and meet Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko) depicting the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers are dangerously overwhelmed by the charismatic technology billionaire, evil Jason Walt, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims he is able to solve the British computer mess.
Englishman and Bo begin their own wild fun odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a delicate French restaurant; they create confusion by sneaking into Walt’s luxury yacht; and Englishman creates absolute chaos by trying to use virtual reality on the head display to get acquainted with the interior of Walt’s building.
Everything is being done for the end, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, there are many elements of children's television.
A lot of moderate elements.
As in the case of Johnny's English films, I can't help thinking about whether the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would take full advantage of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans for Britain to work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan for Britain to work four days a week with a five-day salary.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to allocate the savings from the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which sees it as an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the leading representatives of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "Political changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that fits the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support these cravings at the moment.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's politics and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to outline his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell explained that he was determined to take power away from the "mass of directors" and the "speculators" of the public service company.

He also endorsed plans to incorporate employees into company boards and establish exclusive Ownership Funds to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy answer '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation into the Cavendish case could change their minds
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising the question whether the office finds could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left a more frank impression of a person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," replied Kennedy.
"I said, addressing the hearing, that I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened, when the charge became known, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
Is it possible to get rid of this disease?
"I have made a decision on Breta Caveno and a disruptive charge will be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett resolutely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names were able to confirm it.
Event 36 years old.
I don’t think any changes are expected.”
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will take place in New York, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and with an equally impressive mission: alleviating poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens’ Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people gathering in Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, rapper Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an event set up by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert attendees had to complete a number of tasks or "activities", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant activity to raise awareness about the end of poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 more years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called 'clickiness' when people feel they can really influence something by signing an online petition or tweeting?
The Global Citizen Movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "activities" of its supporters, striving to achieve a variety of goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and declarations resulting from its activities, in respect of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or financed.
The group estimates that almost 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the funds so far.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow up to the fullest", pledging to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, other governments and global citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” Tracey Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after the launch of more than 5,000 measures calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long road where we will stumble and fail at times.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have done, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jack.
US could use Navy to block Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
"When necessary," Washington may use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it operates under a legitimate government invitation, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its navy, can ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them, so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed an audience who had attended an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the "energy consumer's voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are virtually the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy relies heavily on fossil fuels.
It is said that the Trump administration promotes the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, and US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin “dependent” on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes Washington's zealous resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has expressed its opposition to Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industrial Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industrial organisation, has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for 2020 presidential election
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she was considering running for president after mid-term elections.
At a meeting in Holloway, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
“It’s time for women in Washington to ‘clean up’ the imperfect government, which includes the female president,” she wrote in The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the U.S. presidential election."
During the Duma meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, saying he was “guiding the country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his chosen Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavenn.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, an investigation by the FBI is needed before the elections.”
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that most Warren supporters don’t think she should stand for the 2020 election.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Centre for Political Studies/Boston Globe newspaper, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that a senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey showed that former governor Deval Patrick had more support, with 38 percent for running and 48 percent against.
Also in connection with the possible candidacy in the 2020 elections, high-profile Democratic Party figures such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
The Associated Press reported that Biden was determined to make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Pailyn quotes Trek Pailyn PTSS at Donald Trump rally
Trek Peilin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into military service in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through on his return, I can extend to other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and a certain amount of vulnerability returning to our soldiers," she told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pailyn described his arrest as an "obvious problem that everyone is turning a blind eye" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little differently, they are returning fortified, they are returning thinking about whether they respect what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have done for this country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wassil Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wassil, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and of holding a gun while intoxicated.
18 States, District of Columbia faces challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge for a new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia gave a brief presentation to a court adviser in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers facing obstacles to the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions trial initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics in August has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner “and the sons of his violent gangmate” abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international laws that have been in place for decades."
"Federal law provides that all asylum requests are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court adviser said in a brief statement.
In addition, he said that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country are damaging to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions appealed to immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Shelter is available to persons who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sishon said in his June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead doubles in search for survivors
The situation became worse for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, comforting her hectic baby at the evacuation center of the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance service brings new victims.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes and excavating their water-soaked possessions in an effort to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, slept outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were taken care of outside due to the constant strong post-shocks.
His eyes were tearful, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I seem to have been squeezed into the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the purpose of their wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of attempted intimidation through propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper unveiled a four-page ad daily highlighting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the China Daily’s top-selling newspaper Des Moines Register as saying China was trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new step in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s repressive tariffs were targeted at exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, arguing that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and free press, which is so important to America, by placing a paid ad in the 'Des Moines Register,'" Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here in the usual news kiosk in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent opinions and you will not see the true reflection of such divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have in relation to China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party here," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from mid-term elections in the Caveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that they will experience negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and it can be seen that the majority of Republicans have already been willing to give up their vote.
Such cases cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Rieher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn movement, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang demonstratively "November is coming!" in the Senate hallway when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee chose to continue with Caveno's nomination despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially between suburban, volatile voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29) who often don't go to elections even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony of her allegations of sexual abuse by a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts mention a possible failure if the Republicans continued to nominate this candidate.
"This has become a chaos for the Republican Party," former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about what to believe according to Ford and Caveno's testimonies, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are certainly or mostly inclined to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are certainly or mostly inclined to believe Caveno’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said that Caveno may or may not have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee that Caveno, aged 17, had committed a drunken sexual assault on him.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the office of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies in Yale in the 1980s showed her her genitals at a party.
Global Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Take Over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of Legend of Technology, is a company based on the Burners-Lee open source platform Solid.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses "Solid" technology so that people can create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all simultaneously available in the same browser.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who can access and what kind of information.
The company refers to this as "personal power of attorney using data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently operates Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some freelance developers hired for the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team weren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes, completely overnight turning all their business models around.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In an article published by Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee said Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet by forming the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burner-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Burnner-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new era of the web," Burnner-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the Victorian Cross awarded to the clergyman during World War I
For 100 years in its hometown, the event is celebrated, when the only clergyman of the Church of England received the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a fighter.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wen received this award on September 29, 1918, in connection with the attack on Belleglisei and Lehaukort.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he never learned about the highest British military award.
At a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received an important award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wen led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and large fires caused by cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and guided the line with the utmost courage before taking the cannon zone, where he defeated three groups.
Lieutenant Colonel Wen was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, and that is also a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also lay the wreath with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Wen said he felt "honoured to participate in this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support of many people".
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
Imagine you spent the whole night upstairs to see Bellator 206, but in the end you're denied watching this main event.
The San José poster included 13 battles, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised by the changeover to Piglet Peppa.
Some were truly puzzled when they stayed awake all night until dawn, waiting for the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the change of the broadcast to a children's cartoon as a "unsuccessful joke".
"The government has determined that this type of content is unacceptable after 6 p.m., which led to the switchover to a children's programme," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication.
"Piggy Peppa," "yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he would work on scheduling so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
"If we think of repeating the broadcast, I think we can sort of solve it," Cocker said.
"But the clock is there at six in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after switching the broadcast, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent this because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it was not. It was controlled by the government.
I can assure you that there will be no such problems next time.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We tried to please the fans, but we overstressed.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley didn't feel good enough for his sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started high school.
While attending the first Radio 4 program, Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had started talking about homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The permanent manager of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for several months due to illness.
When he appeared as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less worthy" than others, because "it is not accepted in society that both girls and boys can be liked."
He said, "Until today, feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main driving force that has given me the strength and endurance to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was something to disappoint people when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high-level LGBT campaign leader and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for even more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to address society because he was happy that he could live openly and without difficulties, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was surprised to be unprepared."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year and said the age gap had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so many things at such a young age" (his first Olympics was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone in your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, all that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked Daley was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I could not tell him that she would no longer be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to plunge in front of my home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his choice of his first song, Heather Small's "Proud", which resonated with him on his way to the Olympics and still goosebumps.
The programme "Desert Island Discs" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 AM British Summer Time.
It’s also a good idea to start a new business.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday for his 47th Raider Cup play, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid an unsuccessful turn of events.
For the 12th time in the two-year championship, Captain Jim Furyk sat on the reserve bench for Saturday’s four-ball games and two-pair games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so often been the case with the US teams, the five-time winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what was distressing to him.
As the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player, not even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for a tense fight in the uneven field of Le Golf National, where inaccurate shots are regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn’t scary enough, Mikelson will be battling in Sunday’s ninth game against Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with younger Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans lagging behind with four points successfully take the lead at the start of the 12 singles matches, Mikelson’s match could prove decisive.
Furik expressed his confidence in his teammate without any unnecessary words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, spat on my back, put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He is very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think I could have imagined him playing two matches.
I imagined more, but things changed as they did, and that is what we will take into account.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
This is the first time in the history of the European Union that we have seen the impact of the European Union’s economic and social development on the economy.
This could mark the end of the Raiders Cup career, which has never really coincided with his individual record heights.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven draws, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible gains.
"He's cheerful, sarcastic and witty, he likes to have fun with people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the youngest players liked to tease them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a significant lead can quickly fade
The European team captain Thomas Björn knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Raiders Cup in the last day’s singles can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
He made his debut in the 1997 games at Valderrama, where the opposing team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now he reached the finish line with a slight 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had taken the lead in Valderrama; we had taken the lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a slight lead," Bjorn (pictured) said after watching the 2018 graduation group win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show me, and every member of its team, that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give up everything.
Go on the pitch and show your best performance!
It will not be over until the points obtained are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and we will focus on it.
"I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's going on on the other side, the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by the performance of his players on the golf course, Bjorn added: "I was never happy too early.
New challenges await us tomorrow.
Tomorrow there will be individual games, and that's a completely different thing.
It’s great to have a partner with you when things are going well, but your golfer skills are fully tested in individual games.
This is the message you have to convey to your players, namely that they give themselves up in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and he also has to go to show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents, Captain Jim Furick will make sure that his players show their best performance in individual rather than in partner matches, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these important tournaments of the last few days, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and after a defeat when European teams achieved a sensational success, which is later known in the golf world as the Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, brought his players together for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get right into a blast like the one you've seen in Brooklyn, like the one you've seen in Medina.
When such impulse is sent in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-term games.
We made our composition accordingly and ranked the guys in the way we thought right. Let's try to do some spell tomorrow."
Thomas was commissioned to attempt a counter-attack, and ranked Rory McIlroy for the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Poulter Poultwood and Ivan.
"I rank the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the tournament," Bjorn said in relation to the selected singles.
The new German warship is once again postponed for commissioning
The German warship’s latest frigate was supposed to be put into service in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The main ship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class, Rheinland-Pfalz, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military official.
The ship was supposed to join the warship in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class commissioned by the warship in the distant 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some sensitive technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to place new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the state-of-the-art warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power over overseas, will already be obsolete before being put into service, Die Zeit notes.
The failed F125 frigate was noticeable in all headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the warship was returned to the shipyard after delivery.
The reason for this was little known, but German media cited a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship invalid if used on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were a particularly important factor, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, which is only half of the staff of the senior Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the warship to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000 tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
Alongside the faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to have cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of the EUR 2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings of a reduction in the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the warship was really "starting to run out of vessels".
The official stated that the problem has grown considerably over time, as old ships are being decommissioned and new ships are not being delivered in place.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates had joined the warship.
"National Trust" listens to the life of secret bats
The new study, which is being carried out on a Scottish Highland property, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their food search.
The findings are expected to provide new clarity on the unique behaviour of these flying mammals and to support their future protection measures.
Scientists from the Scottish National Trust will study dwarf bats, pygmy bats, as well as brown bilberries and water bats at the Invereves Gardens in Westeros.
The main locations of the property will be equipped with special recorders, which will track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of bat crying and which species perform specific activities.
A map of habitats and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view of bat behaviour.
NTS nature conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have shrunk considerably.
These lands are threatened by construction and development work, which affects bat hiding places and the loss of residence.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, just like fly paper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as attacks by cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful during hunting than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated echo-location method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of bat hideaways and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even set up the first and only specially for bats in Scotland, the Threave Reserve in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bat species found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Here is a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there are still plenty of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stressed the importance of checking that bats do not hide in the area before carrying out property maintenance work, as up to 400 females and their offspring could be killed as a result of the unintentional destruction of one female hiding place, potentially destroying the entire local population.
Bats shall be protected animals and shall not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed in their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for some of their species, we just don't know how they're doing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape by ordering lawyers to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the rape charges against him as "fake news", claiming that people "want to draw attention to themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The football star of Portuguese origin and Turin Juventus is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is said that he paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, she told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after making these allegations, Ronald, 33, turned to his 142 million followers via Instagram online videos, calling this information "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they have claimed today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my work.
I am a lucky person and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel magazine for what they have called "unacceptable privacy suspicion."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to the extent appropriate to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada, it is reported that after getting acquainted with a nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player’s hotel room, where he anally raped a woman.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the incident and said he was "99 percent "good boy" but fell into this "one percent" temptation.
It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this movie.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish a list of the competent authorities of the Member States responsible for carrying out the checks referred to in paragraph 1 and shall, where appropriate, publish it on the website of the competent authorities of the Member States concerned.
A 34-year-old woman says she does not want to accept the terms of the settlement anymore because the incident left a lasting trauma.
In addition, it is important to note that in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to ensure that the rules of the internal market are applied in a manner that is consistent with the principles of the internal market.
Brexit: UK would 'forever regret' loss of car manufacturers
"The UK will "repent it forever" if it loses its global leadership position in the automotive industry after Brexit," business secretary Greg Clark said.
They are "concerned" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that delays at borders in the case of Brexit could put jobs at stake without an agreement.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be halted," said Toyota CEO Marvin Cooke in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is the threatened supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "beat in time" principle, where custom-made cars receive parts every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to some delays and shortages.
The company said Toyota would not be able to retain more than one day’s worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, which would lead to production halts.
Mr Clark said the Theresa May withdrawal plan (Chequers) for future relations with the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need a deal. We want to reach the best deal that allows, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4 on "Today".
"The proof of this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to fully continue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that long-term cost increases would undermine the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works at the factory as a coordinator of the union, said that his comrades are feeling more and more excited: "I can say from experience that as soon as a position disappears, it does not return."
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House reports
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as the fight against the Supreme Court’s candidate Brett Kaveno continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference in the Russian elections, the link between Trump's funds and Russia, and the alleged lack of rule of law on the part of the president.
For months, there have been talks in Washington about whether Trump will dismiss Deputy Attorney General and threaten Miller’s independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording the conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there was talk of his resignation.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of the United States.
Trump said he “would rather” not dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate court hearing, which witnessed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Caveno's allegations for a week, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are happening around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters dispute this assertion: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to aversion to television reporters' "great desire for fame", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are fame-great."
Afterwards, she suggested direct contact between Trump and the result would be an increase in press interest.
"The president engages in more questions-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving further details, "We are interested in their number."
Sanders said the briefings would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is undoubtedly better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot, and you see that we have done a lot in the last few weeks, and it will happen instead of press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by key figures.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The President may have demonstrated the reason for this this week in New York, devoting an uncontrolled and sometimes strange expression to a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at Scottish NHS about fears related to Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working for the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express gratitude and wish endurance after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the MSP less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of permanent applications for status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
This is why I would like to stress once again at this point how much I value the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from inside and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we care for.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Is there anything you can do to protect yourself?
In order to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to establish a common framework for the exchange of information between the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States, in order to facilitate the exchange of information between the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
"He came to the sideline and so to speak collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, the trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on a stretcher and took him for further investigation.
An official in Tennessee told Nashville, Tennessee, WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had been removed from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/severity of the injury" and the Tennessee State team is trying to figure out at what point the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after replacing Illinois with the Tennessee team.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who’s not a good person, but a good person.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state tax when buying a property in the UK, and the extra funds raised will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan.
This will counteract Corbin’s efforts to attract new voters.
The increased state fee will be applied to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury estimates that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year can be raised to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state tax when buying property in the UK and redirecting the extra funds raised to help homeless people, Teresa May will announce today.
This move is seen as an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters by promising more affordable housing and addressing the wealthiest sections of society.
An increased state tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money being earmarked for government efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The surcharge included in the current state fee, including the higher level of fees introduced two years ago for the purchase and lease of a second home, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury foresees that such a move could add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-residents, pushing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access their homes.
Many areas of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to renounce quotas for affordable housing in order to deal with the UK housing problem.
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rent control and eviction for no reason.
He also wants to give councils more powers for the construction of new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said that I would use my position as prime minister to renew the British dream that every young generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means reorganizing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and non-UK residents, as well as hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the harsh problem of homelessness remains relevant."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to rebuild the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer, he switched to Stadium of Light after redirecting St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that's it," Ross told the Scottish BBC's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland games at Hampden Park with my father, and it's always been inviting me back.
But that would only happen if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in the management of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guss Di Poyet un Kanyet.
The former boss of the Alloa Athletic says he hasn’t been excited to follow in the footsteps of such a large club’s acclaimed leaders, previously rejecting Barnsley’s and Ipswich’s proposals.
"My success will be judged by whether I can return to the Premier League.
It’s a great way to get to know people.
“Returning to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I’m likely to think that I’ll be successful here only when I’ve done it.”
Ross is only the third year in his managerial career, having previously served as deputy director in Dumbarton and spent a 15-month period with the Hearts coaches.
He then helped the Alloa to recover from the fall to the third level and in the same season helped the St Mirren to win the title of champion.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It may have been a real crossroads," he recalls, assuming responsibility for the Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was my real calling — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds weird, because I had a good success, I could live from it and also enjoy certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel this because of work-related stress and pressure, but leadership is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is at 17.30 p.m. on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has caused the less popular pubs in Britain to shrink, but it has put pressure on restaurant chains.
The data showed that in July sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents CGA, a business consultancy, said: "Constantly sunny weather and England's continued participation in the World Cup meant that July was a similar trend to June, with pub profits rising 2.8 percent while restaurants dropping.
Restaurants, whose sales dropped by 1.8 per cent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in drink pubs and bars was most gracious, as they experienced a much larger upturn than restaurants experienced a downturn.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant workers did.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the monthly sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent, while the sales of food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend towards the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of extensive social or sporting events are the major factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the same period last year will be particularly painful for the additional constant cost pressure.
In the case of food suppliers, the long and hot summer could not have come at a more inopportune time, and time will tell whether the temperate temperatures we normally experience in August will provide the much-needed rest."
The overall increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in brand sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK sales monitor for the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, which is an industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from their parents
The survey reveals that one in five children, some just 11 years old, have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake profiles on Instagram, a photo-sharing site, is rapidly increasing.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "clean master" account to show to their parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It is frightening that so many teenagers create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
It’s also a good idea to start a new business.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning indoor and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sport-driven people to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eileen is honoured throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit tremendously from being on the board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a 'lightweight voice' and I hope I can really engage and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, winning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke that day a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, re-learned how to walk and today I can do skill training!
Thank you for your inspiring words!”
Is it possible to get rid of the disease?
Breast milk pump company has taken care of online disagreements regarding advertising comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad for a sticky milk to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in the hay-filled cow barn at the song whose words are something like: "Yes, I sweep myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice, these aren't udders, these are my breasts."
The singing continues: "Suction, suction, I'm feeding the babies, suction, suction, I'm milking my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has had a wide online resonance.
The 77,000 times viewed and hundreds of times commented video has received split viewer feedback, and many claim that it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very wrong decision to use cows to advertise a product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after they are born.
"Elvie" breast pump unmistakably fits in breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: "I understand that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
The following opinion was also heard: "The advertisers did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that in her opinion the song was "fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
The suction of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I understood the idea.
This is a brilliant product," he wrote.
Another comment says: "It's a fun advertisement for moms who are milking milk (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not advertising that glorifies or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who milk claim to feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and fits inconspicuously into the suckling women’s bra, allowing them to move freely, hold their babies and even take part in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch on the market.
Drawing a parallel between milk-releasing women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to milk-release while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has been put in the spotlight.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue at the show of Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively the same as in the past, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult for children to stay with sponsors.
Usually, most of the sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that, if they openly apply for a child, this will jeopardise their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would be allowed to take their fingerprints, and this data would be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs law enforcement official, testified ahead of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been punished.
"Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these persons are criminal aliens.
We therefore continue to persecute such persons," Mr Albens said.
According to asylum workers, in an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court as early as one month after detention, rather than after 60 days, as the previous standard foresaw.
Many will use videoconferencing instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed unfit for release will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, according to information provided by asylum workers and evidence retrieved from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more often overlooked due to their spaciousness.
They added that moving children to a campsite without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to say goodbye to friends could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish 'occupying armies' to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were in Syria illegally under the pretext of counter-terrorism, and "this will be addressed accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared" of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions were great for them to return, and blamed "certain Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that prevented them from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the reconstruction of the country until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a three-million-strong province.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement "has time limits" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked militants Jabhat al-Nusrah, who will be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualems set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the existing constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and this is perhaps what many liberal observers hope for, the impact and scandal will not prematurely put an end to his presidency.
And then "this will be the most dramatic presidency final ever!"
At the moment, there is no sign of a loosening of the observers.
Since 2014, ratings at CNN's most profitable time have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, while at MSNBC they have almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" ranks at the top of the cable list with 3.5 million viewers of the main news in the evening.
“It’s a fire that attracts many people because it’s an incomprehensible thing to us,” explained Neal Baer, a pillar of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” drama. This drama tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has her own theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" said Ms. Scowell.
Chaos is somewhat entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Roue v. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet, it's more than being an informed citizen when you watch a group of experts discussing at six o'clock how Bob Woodward used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's description of a <0x24>15,000 bomber-like jacket from ostrich feathers and skins, "whose suit is going to be sucked from."
I’ll never see Super Mario again.
"A part of what he does, which gives the impression of a reality show, is that he gives you information every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show Pawn Stars, explained about the changing team of Trump's show and the daily developments of the show (Chinese with N.F.

Is it possible to get rid of the disease?
It is no wonder that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is seeking money thanks to the transformation of the Congressional Districts, as a result of which the two existing Members will fight for one seat.
This recently redesigned area on the outskirts of Pittsburgh is linked to Conor Lamb, a Democrat who won his seat in a special election last spring in another area.
Lemb will fight another existing member, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, the maps were reworked.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to a struggle between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became famous in Pennsylvania when he won the widely observed March elections at Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
It was held by Republicans for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
The political experts expect the Democrats to take a small lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then changed its mind
Diplomats admitted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners pulled out the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, citing "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore," Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were considered limited to El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million euros from the United States, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached their peak.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, recognised as a rapprochement effort to prevent migrant migration to the US.
In mid-September, senior state officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially putting an end to the considerations of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration is focusing on the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to give more details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to negotiate internally if their anonymity was preserved.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
History research
The second stone in the garden could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr. Trump may have hindered justice, for which the public has a lot of evidence.
It is said that Mr. Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to respond to the body and possibly to the jury of his peers just as he plans to meet with voters again.
There is a lot of "but" and I am not arguing that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his companions in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic will have to make, and these choices will show the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape years of carnage.
History is turning around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such milestones.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly recording a conversation with the president and wondered about his inadequacy for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the FBI's investigation of Brett Cavenneau, just requested, is not complete or fair, or if he is approved as a Supreme Court judge despite his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And, most importantly, will we vote in a mid-term election to the Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not endure all these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my post office.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.

"We can be happy about that because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game in the belief that we would be able to make a good success, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them in the end, but the overall tie is a fair result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we left in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another major night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year with all my injuries and changes in the club itself was obviously difficult, but now there are new breezes, which I feel good about.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave last season behind and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents clearly knew what they wanted to receive, few had discussed the issue with family members.
Around half of individuals in a nationwide study indicated that they did not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by family members, but they don’t do anything to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover these costs, or securing your assets — most importantly, having money.
Prepare your own legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they begin.
Talk to the health trustee so that you have a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act in accordance with your preferences if you are unable to express them on your own.
Consider also giving a financial mandate.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
Imagine one of your elderly parents being taken to the hospital to receive emergency care.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Set these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you not to prepare.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who's the doctor," Martina said.
"What are the medications used for?

The man received several shots with an air rifle, going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and palm.
Police described the shooting at around 2.30 BST as "accidental".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are life-threatening, and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, the strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday killed at least 384 people, and the number of victims is expected to increase.
Because of the devastated communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala area north of Palu, close to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the devastating natural disaster.
Here is basic information about Palu and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had a population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area that stretches for about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that 299 200 people lived in the province’s administrative region in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic pillars of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra caused a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake erupted in the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake erupted near Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves up to 10 metres in height, devastating dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake near the surface hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded of the devastation that the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004 brought with it.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peilin's eldest son arrested after allegation of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, the 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report what she claimed was a crime, he took her phone away.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about whether he pleads guilty, he said he was “certainly not guilty”.
He has been charged with three A-class offences, punishable by a year’s imprisonment and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also accused of a B-class offence, which could result in a day-long prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Pauline has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Pailyn, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
The case is currently pending before the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In 2016, she was accused of domestic violence, of obstructing a report on domestic violence and of carrying a gun under the influence of alcohol in connection with this incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a fist in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peilin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder when she returned from service in Iraq.
Earthquake Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died following the earthquake that hit the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude of 7.5 quakes caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake broke out near central Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social networks, videos that show the moment of the collision are spreading.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he shot down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury, as stated in a statement of intention to demand the death penalty filed at a New York South District Court.
According to the court document, both of these charges could lead to the death penalty.
Within weeks of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury adopted an indictment for prosecuting Saipov in 22 indictments, which included eight charges of murder for extortion purposes, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as allegations of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditation,” the prosecutor explained, citing Saipov’s attack as “terrible, cruel and inhumane.”
"Saifullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> (Payfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov) in a statement wounded, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anna-Loria Arcaden D<0xC4><0x81>rreiks (Ann-Laure Decadt), D<0xC4><0x81>rren
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since prosecutors at the South District Court in New York City charged with a death penalty case.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death after being charged with spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, after days and months, Uzbek-born Saipov did not regret the attack.
It’s not the only way to get rid of it.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out an attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said he had also asked for permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has dismissed 22 articles of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said he was "very naturally dissatisfied" with the indictment.
“We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty instead of accepting guilt recognition in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the trauma caused by what is happening to all parties involved,” Paton explained.
A team of Saipov's defenders has previously called on prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
Nigel Farage pledged at a conservative conference today to "mobilize the nation's army".
A former leader of the British Independent Party said that politicians should feel the anger of Eurosceptics when a member of Theresa May's parliament suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative member Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have left long ago if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that Ms. May will have to face in trying to unite her conflict-torn party was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who supported staying in the EU and joined a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union (Chequers compromise), and is experiencing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
Allies insisted that she would resolutely try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Boune at the "Leave Means Leave" rally in Solihull announced that he wanted to throw the Maya Plan in the dung (the chuck Chequers).
He proposed making Mr Farage an ally and entrusting him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been to say, we would already have quit," Boun said.
Wellingborough MEP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw the Maya Plan in the junk!"
Justifying his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to be servants!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored allegations that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Andrea Jenkyn, a Brexit supporter, also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please give up the Chequers and start listening."
She added in the news, focusing on May, “Prime Ministers remain in place as they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said the politicians at the rally should feel pressured if they are going to override the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over the Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he fills up: "I want you to let our politicians, who are going to betray the Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never relax until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the visitors were walking through Birmingham before a two-hour rally was held in the city centre.
I don’t know how to do it, but I don’t know how to do it.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Workers’ Party, ridiculed the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced with the party’s application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us they can maintain the order of their IT system and all their technology for Canada and more, for an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren Wants to Candidate for President of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider" running for the U.S. presidential election after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democrat talked about her future at the West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November and runs for GOP Republican Geoff Deal, who was Trump’s 2016 Deputy Chairman of the Massachusetts Campaign.
It is speculative that she will be the main one to dare to run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters through the town hall since Trump took office.
One visitor asked her if she planned to run for president.
To which Warren replied that it was time that "there were women in Washington who would "clean" the imperfect government, which also means the woman-president."
This is the first time I have seen this film.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which will take place in the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the future of digital Single Market.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced that Dayton Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11.00 ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for assistance in recognizing the man in the video.
The Sims (20) was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Shadow Sims was shot in the head, resulting in immediate death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, over 247 Sports.
Way rushed to defend his friend and Simpsons shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and he admitted that he was at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and also admitted that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is at the police station in East Baton Rouge Village.
The 6-foot 6 junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds in the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets close to world championship after team let him beat Sebastian Fetel
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
From the start, Bottas started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his seat in the first two trips and urging Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first went into the garage and left Hamilton in the drives to cope with the rest, which was probably decisive.
The Mercedes pilot rebounded later and lagged behind Fetela, but Hamilton continued to take the lead after a balance of forces that saw the Ferrari rider persistently leave the inside free, risking to lag behind after a double maneuver to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he focused tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen on the fourth.
Eventually, he arrived at the garage on the 44th lap, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps, as Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job of getting one for two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at Saturday’s rally for her persistence in not disclosing a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavenn of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly talk about Ford’s testimony to the Senate’s legal commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed people there were “evil, nasty and unreliable.”
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and the leaked information, and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Is that what we did... No, we didn't do it," he added, in the intonation of the senator.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein explaining in detail what Ford accused Kaveno of, and in early September, the content of the letter was disclosed, but Feinstein denies that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't "leak" her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did."
But her denial did not please the president, who commented on the situation at the Saturday evening rally like this: "I'll tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President proposed that the Democrats use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any means."
If you see evil, inconvenience, they don’t care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Is it possible to get rid of the disease in the early stages?
In addition, it is important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
The Giants scored an early lead when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney took the lead before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
If you want to get rid of the disease, you need to take care of your health and well-being.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's boys who won the Dundee on Friday night with 2 to 1.
It was the fourth game of the season that the Giants had won in the previous three games.
Dwyer revealed the result in the fourth minute, 3:35 after receiving a pass from Kendal McFaul, with David Rutherford assisting Bovillier doubled the result four minutes later.
After a tense start to the game, Sullivan entered the home game at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquard played Cowney to score and score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants regained the lead at the first opportunity when he scored his second goal in this evening's game at the end of the first period.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nealsen lead the Dundee for the first time during the end of the second period of the game, and he also confidently scored a goal in the last period to lead his team to victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their five games, will play the next game on Friday, where they will meet the Milton Keynes at home.
Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised as a hero after sacrificing himself to take off safely from land a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue in the area and many are trapped in the mud in Palu.
But despite his colleagues saving their lives, 21-year-old Antony Ganavun Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu Airport control tower, which swayed strongly.
He stayed at his post to make sure that the aircraft Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely take off.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower, thinking it could collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"We are heartbreakingly saddened to hear this," he fills.
Meanwhile, state authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongal, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beautiful will grow because many more people's bodies are under the rubble, and many are not accessible," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching a height of 6 meters destroyed the palace, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to supply aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old young mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, the ambulance service brings new victims.
Clean water is a shortage.
Small shops are crowded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the country's military invasion: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already hit by the earthquakes in Lombok this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which the plane fell into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims one of the people has disappeared, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release on Saturday afternoon when they were unable to answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local residents helped rescue other passengers and crew by boat after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said six people remained in hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought that the plane overestimated the runway length.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Jane.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using emergency exits because the water was just up to the waist.
He said that the stewardess panicked and screamed, and that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked near to improve the berth of the ship also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years, none of them are related to Air Niugini.
A commentator of psychoanalysis explains the course of events in the night in which a woman was burned alive
The accusation on Saturday provided evidence in a retrial in which a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a psychoanalytical commentator at the U.S. Department of Forensic Expertise, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information from the phone to put together how 29-year-old accused Quinton Tell and 19-year-old prisoner Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rovlet said he had received location data from several phones, suggesting that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimonies, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified in the courtroom on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the accusation asked whether Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Telis said he only knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telis erased text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased him from his life," said Hale.
It is planned that the defence will present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
Group "The High Breed": What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative views about this genre of music, giving a positive message with their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has deviated from its origins in terms of political messages and in terms of solving social problems.
The band wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, babysitter sues couple for dismissal after receiving 'racist' news
In New York, a babysitter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from a mother who complained that the babysitter "is black again."
The couple denies being racist, equating the trial to "expulsion".
Lindsey Plasco-Flaksman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she found out that a young caregiver, Giselle Mauries, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"N<0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xA6>, BACK BLACK," Plasco-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent a message to Maurice, twice.
Realizing his clumsiness, the "confused" Plasco-Flaxman rebate on Maurice, suggesting that their former nanny, who was an African-American, did a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippine woman, citing the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple for redundancy and wants <0x24>350 a day for six months of secured living for which she initially applied, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said in the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects the allegations that they are racists, claiming that Maurice’s employment was a reasonable decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being insulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasko, the husband, "Post."
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you treated rudely, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Equalizing the court hearing to "expulsion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the little one only two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"Do you really turn against someone in this way?
This is not acceptable," added the investment banker.
While litigation is still ongoing, public opinions quickly judge across social networks, despising them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that publishers of Paddington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate themselves with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone’s shoes who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising now to find out what we know about Paddington's great success."
Telling that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before feeling the inspiration to write a book for children about a little teddy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweet bitter" after his father's death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she calls a "very important member of the family," her father quietly prided himself on her eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and not boastful," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all his merits to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye by phone to my dying daughter
After landing, her daughter was taken with ambulances to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and she was expected not to survive," Ednan-Laperuze said.
"Then I received a call from Neda saying that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to maintain heartbeat slowly ended and left her body.
She would have died even earlier, and it's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t yell or yell because I was in a situation where families and people were around.
I needed a lot of strength to restrain myself."
After all, then, already mourning the loss of her daughter, Ednan-Laperrouze boarded the plane with other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and the tears ran all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
mourning women hang cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are trying to help others not to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey amplify the cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
Tyler, Davis’ son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him with a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be consequences."
Davis made cards "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence, you have to talk."
Humphrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, her husband, for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he would be sad or depressed or that he would feel any quotes,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
His death was a big trauma for the children, but they have to deal with it: "It is destroying the whole family.
That's what sets us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

The future of Bret Caveno hangs in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for -- in a limited investigation of time and scope -- we could possibly reach a little consensus," Flake said on Saturday, adding he was concerned that the commission was "sharing" between the riots of hardened partisans.
Why do Kaveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is just a coincidence.
The interim elections are five weeks away, on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to be bad, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among them to the highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked in the White House during the Bush period and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on the vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership 'decreased' number of North Korean asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Yong came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011, when their number was 2,706.
The park said that tighter border controls on North Korea and China and high human smuggler rates are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Yong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress in the talks.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will under no circumstances be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Caveno "hysterical" and says he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the head of the court’s minority, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Caveno “hysterical” and claimed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of his reaction to Caveno's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission on Thursday.
Cavenno emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and smooching, talking about his family and high school years.
In particular, he condemned the Democrats on the commission, calling the allegations against him of "grotesque and concerted destruction of character" organised by liberals who are angry at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes that Caveno’s testimony is a justification for not being able to work for the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such allegations and the treatment he is taking against Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Caveno if he was approved and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say that if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s unfit not only for a position in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace in the court,” Pelosi said.
Kaveno, currently, is a judge at the Washington County Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was worried about the possibility that Caveno would make decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way because she was considered a conservative judge.
In his approval talks, Kaveno bypassed the question of whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and dubious person to work in court, but we would expect us to gladly say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
But women have to hold themselves in their hands.
It's denunciation, months and years, everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she's not allowed to get it all out of herself by crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She went on, "One time, I was very helped by a woman who was the manager of a company, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she made a technique -- when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are only partially recognized as a form of anger discharge, because they are misunderstood at the very bottom.
One of my brightest memories is from the oldest work with a high proportion of men, when I once cried because of my undisclosed anger, when I was grabbed at the withers by an older woman, a reticent manager (woman) from whom I was always a little scared, who drove me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you're counted.
They think you're upset and just glad you managed to get under your skin."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in illegitimate ties, left a ship called "foolishness" and withdrew from the elections, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not stand for the presidency.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she laughed and told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted was another one to appear.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She late got involved in the campaign, she lagged behind in fundraising and promised that she would not take part in the elections unless <0x24>2 million were collected.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to males, donated only <0x24>250 to her.
"Do they feel that I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional – grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and angry at sexism – in which she was “suffered”.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they would write on my gravestone.
"She was crying."
Why the US-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The main excuses for the start of the trade war between the United States and China are hidden, and while the battle does not see an end, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
President Donald Trump issued a first warning early this year, taxing China’s main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), immediately charging half of U.S. exports from China.
Beijing also "kindly" responds each time, the latest is five to ten percent rates of 60 billion dollars worth of American goods.
China has declared that it commits to responding to the US one-on-one and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world’s second largest economy could guess.
In order for Washington to resign, it would be necessary to accept certain demands, but it would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping to bow down to the United States in public.
But, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure from the U.S. trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which is really more dangerous than previously recognized by observers," said Abigail Grace, a New American Security researcher who focuses on Asia.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to take refugees back voluntarily and calls for help in rebuilding a country that has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and earning their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said the Syrian regime would accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the unrest.
The European golf team has won the Raiders Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the Raiders Cup 2018, beating the US national team 16,5:10,5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost to Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raiders Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by the dancer Thomas Björn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the U.S. national team.
The US star Phil Maikelson, who had a hard time passing the entire tournament, punched his T-shoe in the water at the 16th pit of PAR 3, conceding in the match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all of his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament is played in its current format.
American Jordan Spit lost the European team in a sensational 5-to-4 game to the lowest-ranking player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, lost two to one to Ian Polter of England, who probably won the Raiders Cup.
Sergio García, a veteran of the eight Raiders Cups, became the best European player of all time with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't hold my tears."
It was a tough year.
I am sincerely grateful to Thomas for highlighting me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy that we've got the cup back.
It is the team's merit and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia commented emotionally after the victory of the European team.
He then gives the floor to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won the US golf legend Tiger Woods in two-to-one singles.
"The pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods grew up following this player's course," said Ram, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and currently has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Raiders Cup.
It’s not a bad statistic for one of the best players of all time to win 14 top-level golf tournaments as the second player behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their chances, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
The United States team captain Jim Furik said after his team's unsatisfactory performance: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning was the time when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raider Cup committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to beat your hats.
We've been won."
