MG Baltic case: Gustaini’s new lawyer says he has not yet got acquainted with the case file
The 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday was attended by all accused: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the accused.
At the last court hearing, the state-appointed new attorney of Gustaini, Aleksandr Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev, told the panel of judges that he had not yet got acquainted with the case file.
Then Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the lawyer of MG Baltic, said that in order to ensure a full defence of a person, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to familiarize himself with the case file and asked for the hearing to be postponed.
"In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to the criminal file.
It's not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
The new attorney, A. Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev, pointed out that he had not been able to acquaint himself with the indictment or with the entire case file.
At a previous court hearing, the suspect, <0xC5><0xA0>. Gustainis, announced that he would refuse his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also listened to.
The defendant's lawyers were outraged that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, by taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the decision of public procurement winners, ELTA recalls.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 persons were interviewed, of whom more than 50 were members of the previous Seimas, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches were carried out.
Gustainis is suspected of receiving a bribe of more than 8,000 euros, G. Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius of more than 15,000 euros and V. Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys of more than 27,000 euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in influence, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in influence.
Politicians are suspected of having consulted MG Baltic’s vice president, R. Kurlianskis, on bribes, and then suggested or supported initiatives in favour of the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics Watchdogs: Liberal Movement Board is Right About the Act of Vilnius Branch
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the Articles of Association," its chairman Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas told BNS after the commission meeting.
“This decision was not new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July when the question of Pag<0xC4><0x97>giai and Utena was raised.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter for the board of directors.
And if the board decides that a section can do what it wants to do - go to the committee and the board approves it, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has accepted, then it is a decision that all sections will form party lists.
And if you don’t agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go to the committee.”
According to Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the party’s board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the party overturned the decision of the Vilnius City Branch to take part in the municipal elections not with the party’s list, but with the list of the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party’s statutes and decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius Branch had to cancel its aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the committee’s list.
But the department did not.
The former head of the section, MP Au<0xC5><0xA1>rin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already resigned from the Liberal Movement.
Vilnius Mayor Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, the former chairman of the Liberal Movement, who promises to seek another term as the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, we are proud of!"
He also left the party.
Elections for municipal councils and mayors will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India have smashed a tiger with a tractor that previously tore a man, officials said Monday.
Forest official Mahavir Kaujlagi said the tiger had torn down a man working in the fields late Sunday, surrounded the beast and struck her with a tractor as she tried to escape.
Residents say the tiger also attacked and insured a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Sanctuary in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 kilometres southeast of the capital of Uttar Pradesh, Laknau.
Tigers are prohibited in protected areas.
Director Ramesh Pandey said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh hit another tiger, who was seriously injured.
The tiger is the national animal of India; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, the tiger is considered an endangered species.
Last year’s government figures showed at least one person was killed every day in collisions with wild tigers or elephants over the past three years.
Human conflicts with tigers have been steadily increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection program that included national park reserves and criminalized big cats.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the census suggests that the then-population of about 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Dogs and cats must be labelled with microchips
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose mandatory marking of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
“We suggest that cats and dogs be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking are organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labeled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will also be labeled free of charge, so residents will not have to worry and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee.
Amendments to the law are aimed at addressing the systematic need for pet labelling.
It is hoped that this will help avoid problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that, based on the expected average cost of providing the microchip and the service, which will amount to about EUR 5, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of marking all pets can reach up to 6 million euros.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be spread over three years and will amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is expected that the funds for the labelling programmes will be allocated through the Special Programme for the Support of Municipal Environmental Protection, the revenue of which will increase significantly this year due to the increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the practice of mandatory labelling is widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because the lost ones can be easily returned to the owners), and saves the time of the breeders themselves, when the search for an escaped and lost pet requires a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only pets that are labelled can be travelled.
At the same time, the marking obliges the animal to take care of it responsibly throughout its lifetime.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling were opposed, as the respective programmes were proposed to be funded by the population.
"The model now presented should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection with increased income in the environmental support program and to grant the right to label not only veterinarians, but also public officials, i.e. persons in animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different factions of the Seimas - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
Thirteen Government Forces Killed in Taliban Attack in Eastern Afghanistan
Provincial governor spokesman Arif Noori said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were wounded in the assault on a joint army and police control post in Khogyani district.
In a three-hour battle with Afghan forces, six fighters were killed and ten other Taliban were wounded, Noori said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategic area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Morning" extends a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held in Vilnius "Morning" arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
A duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Morning, which has a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will welcome Cherkassy Mavpy and Pristina KB Prishtina teams under its roof on November 7.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to host this match at home, so we are very pleased that our friends from Vilnius agreed to welcome us," Ukrainian coach Maxim Michelson said.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best countries in the world with basketball traditions, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get support from the widows.
The Kosovo team was unable to come to Ukraine because the countries had no diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team is in third place after the first round with one victory in three matches, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be a very important match for Group E, as only two teams will go to the next round.
In the past, the Ukrainian and Kosovo national teams also played in the selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
The 100-61 victory was then played by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match free of charge on Wednesday, and the start of the duel will be at 7 p.m.
"Women Lie Better" star actress B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> is being pursued by liars
Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but the charming brown-haired actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> has been receiving roles related to liars for several times already.
First the series "Women Lie Better", then the performance "Liars" and finally the comedy "Liars".
In this film, Brigitta plays the stunning wife of Dainius Kazlauskas’ hero.
“I really liked filming in Liars, because I’m more of a theater actress and I rarely appear in the movies.
A great team of colleagues has promised a great result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was a puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by these small, decorative "fif" four-legged.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully," the actress smiled.
From the very first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" is introduced to the comic and intriguing peripetiai of family members. It was produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys..." producers Paulius Virbickas and Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas.
Your beloved just told you she's pregnant.
That would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Not having time to proclaim the "good news" to everyone, parents suddenly declare - they're different!
Fifty years later, together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the ending will be even more surprising, because no one expected such an atomization.
All the heroes are not what they seemed to be at first glance.
In addition to B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97>'s comedy "Liegaigiai", the audience will be given a good mood by four generations of film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Liubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Liars" - in cinemas from November 9th
Decide whether to write off <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in unpaid taxes
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Place of Residence prepared by the leader of the "Farmers" Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis.
56 MPs voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will then proceed to consider the amendments on 6 December or later, when it receives a conclusion from the Government.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared leaving Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years, one person does not pay about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000 such people.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "call some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
The Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from the fact that they come to Lithuania for medical treatment by paying a small health insurance tax - they are provided the same services as residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered as having left Lithuania, and Sodra will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of "Sodra" Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of both emigrants and the activities of "Sodra".
Video of a sliding teddy bear reveals a serious problem
As a mother, a bear climbs a steep snowy slope, the little one climbs, slips down, and climbs again.
The video received many reviews and comments.
People admired the tenacity of the little bear - he repeatedly slipped down and climbed back to his mother.
He does not succeed the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video did indeed belong to attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to learn about wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
“I think the drone was terrifying.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If drones didn’t fly around, they’d probably have chosen a safer path, or they’d overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Dr. Dittmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were equipped with heart metering.
When the drone approached, some bears would run, others would not run anywhere, but all their hearts beat more often.
Scientists advise animals to use drones responsibly, not to fly too close, make noise or fly where prohibited.
He spoke to the president through a newspaper.
A Kiev court on Tuesday summoned ousted Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to appear in an unusual way at a trial over his alleged treason, the summons being published in the state's official gazette.
The summons, published in the government's Uriadovoj Kurier newspaper, called the former leader to appear at a criminal trial hearing on November 19 to hear his concluding arguments.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the hearing by video link.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced it had closed the debate on Yanukovych's case.
Yanukovych's Russian lawyer, Alexander Goroshnysky, was given the opportunity to register with the register of foreign lawyers by November 19, so he could attend a hearing where Yanukovych is expected to have his last word by video link.
Yanukovych, backed by the Kremlin, was ousted and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by his refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, and a war broke out in the east between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, about 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting, despite numerous efforts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
A former Minister of Economy, MP Dainius Kreivys, was approved as a Conservative candidate for the year earlier.
During the Conservative primary elections on the weekend, the party members ranking the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, chairman of the Vilnius branch meeting of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the list of conservatives.
The top ten candidates included Vilnius City Municipal Council members Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adomas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kien<0xC4><0x97>, former Member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives League Mantas Benkunskas, Ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Valinskas and Goda Karazijait<0xC4><0x97>.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 next year.
Restrictions on Cogeneration Power Plants Appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (Court) the ruling government’s decision to pass a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Seimas Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) group announced that a group of Seimas members had appealed to the Court to investigate the constitutionality of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the ruling government.
"Parliamentarians underline that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the current projects of waste incineration plants, instructing the government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the area of residence) before the entry into force of the law on the construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas," the statement said.
"Parliamentarians note that, taking into account the wording of the law prohibiting the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e., determining the distance and defining the concept of a 'residential area'), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, since the established criteria are formulated in such a territory.
The petition states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The Court of Justice has repeatedly stated that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an undefined criterion.
Establishing such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the statement said.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of cogeneration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
Stopping the projects currently being carried out would not only cause the state hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses would also be incurred by the Lithuanian population - heating prices would increase, the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills would increase environmental pollution.
The address was signed by members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Deputy elder of the Social Democratic Group and the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to win 71 votes to reject President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s veto on the amendments to the Waste Management Law, which provide for the government's right to halt the construction of cogeneration power plants already underway, as well as to establish a "quarantine" zone 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law adopted by the Seimas will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
The proposal is expected to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to suspend already started projects is not planned to be abandoned.
The case will be dealt with in sequence - not earlier than one year.
LeBron James' statistics at the Lakers
LeBron James’s career start at the Los Angeles Lakers isn’t what he, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers began the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped rush rumors into a possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, the speech was calmed by the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said the coach would not be fired, but he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, is looking back on himself.
Although the attacker's stats are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But she doesn’t tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other figures showed that the Lakers are better off when James is not on the pitch.
An unfavorable +/- statistic that shows how many points the team scores or misses when there are certain players in the field.
When James is on the pitch, the Lakers have spent 30 points more than their rivals this season.
While he was sitting on the bench, the Lakers scored 19 points more than their rivals.
The Lakers are currently in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn things upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region," Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO Air Policing and Air Policing Strengthening Missions in the Baltic States, including three in Lithuania.
The last Eurofighter fighter aircraft of Spain were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations were held between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is Spain’s fifth representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
V. <0xC4><0x8C>ien<0xC4><0x97> on arrest of R. <0xC4><0x8C>as: I believe in man’s innocence and law enforcement
For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the offices are probably doing the job they have to do.
We all do our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions should be made by him," <0xC4><0x8C>ien<0xC4><0x97> told BNS.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still being the director of the administration of Raseiniai municipality, took a high-value bribe and, in return, could have created exceptional conditions for a private company that had signed a contract with the municipally-owned Raseiniai bus fleet.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a or participating in the masking of bribes through various financial operations.
In April of this year, Raseiniai District Municipality Council dismissed R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as from the position of the head of the administration in a third attempt after a expressed distrust.
The former "orderman" became a member of the newly-established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March this year, suspending his membership in the party on Monday.
Several years ago, R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as unsuccessfully ran for the mayoral elections as a representative of the election committee "Tavo Raseiniai".
V. <0xC4><0x8C>ien<0xC4><0x97> says that the man did not intend to stand for mayoral elections in Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in municipal council elections.
V. <0xC4><0x8C>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union and is a member of the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action, which will determine whether she resigns from the commission.
“I’m not going to make a decision this week, I’m going to make a decision this week.
I will see, if necessary, what charges have been made, of course I will make one decision or another.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, time will put everything in its place," she said.
Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97>, a representative of opposition conservatives in the Seimas, urged Seimas Speaker Viktoras Pranckietis and Peasant Leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of their group colleague Vida A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> and recall her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring her work to another Seimas committee.
She argues that further work by V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would create a justified distrust in the public and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission".
Sensual "Coldplay" music attracted and famous Lithuanian couples
On Monday evening, many music and film lovers gathered for the pre-production of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
A group of well-known people came to the event: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Sillya and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular pop bands Coldplay, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
The documentary director Matas Whitecross met the band's men when they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see footage from concerts behind the scenes, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and formed Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman and later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and released their first record, Safety, exactly twenty years ago, containing three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the recording, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were traded.
Coldplay is now a world-famous, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums that have sold over 100 million copies.
Over the past two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
V. <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis married to "Juventus" - LKL weekly MVP
Vaidas <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis, the tallest player of Utena Juventus, earned the title of the most useful player of the week.
The center scored a double double, which helped the Juventus team to beat the Alytus Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kija players in the 86-77 extension.
In almost 31 minutes, <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis scored 13 points (5/6 colons) and rebounded 11 balls.
In addition, the high-rise provoked 7 opponents' fouls, intercepted 3 balls and performed 4 assists.
Such indicators guaranteed 30 points of utility.
This season, <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis scores 17.2 points, which is the best indicator of his career in the 11th season of the LKL.
He is the fourth most successful player of the season.
Together with V. <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis, Martynas Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and K<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>tofas Lavrinovi<0xC4><0x8D>ius (both - Prienai "Skycop"), Yannickas Franke (Pasvalys "Pieno <0xC5><0xBE>vaig<0xC5><0xBE>d<0xC4><0x97>s") and Jerai Grantas (Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da "Nept<0xC5><0xAB>nas") were among the top five.
Only recently Pasvalys legionnaire Y. Franke 88:93 in the lost match against Prienai Skycop scored 24 points, recaptured 10 balls and provoked 8 opponents’ fouls, earning as much as 31 utility points.
However, he was not allowed to become the best player of the week because of the team’s defeat.
The defensive chain in the top five with the Legionnaire of the Pasvalys team consists of his opponent of that day - M. Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, representing the Prienai team.
He scored 19 points and regained 9 balls.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 utility scores.
Another "Skycop" basketball player can be seen in the tallest chain - K. Lavrinovi<0xC4><0x8D>ius scored 15 points in Sunday's game (3/4 of a double, 9/11 penalty), provoked 7 opponents' fouls and scored 23 utility points.
J. Grantas, Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da "Nept<0xC5><0xAB>nas" striker, played a powerful match in Vilnius, also entered the top five.
The American scored 25 points in 25 minutes (10/11), recaptured 4 and took over 3 balls, thus earning 29 utility points.
This legionnaire's performance allowed the Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da residents to triumph over the local "Morning" 78:66.

Palestinian Israeli Knife Shot in West Bank
The soldier "prevented this attack by identifying a terrorist who tried to strike with a knife a civilian and an IDF officer," the Israeli army said in a statement on the incident at the Kirjat-Arba settlement near Hebron.
"The soldier fired a terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not injured," the statement added.
A military spokeswoman told AFP the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
Video footage of the incident shows that he was not seriously injured.
A wave of Palestinian attacks of a similar nature began in 2015.
The number of such attacks has declined in recent years, but there are fears that a new wave may emerge.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot dead after attacking a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron with a knife.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
During the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum in Shanghai, D. Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> underlined that in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world", targeting the fundamental causes of tensions caused by trade wars, "excess production and unfair competition".
"China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important for the European Union, which is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
According to her, China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that the transparency of investments should be "beyond the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict adherence to international agreements - this must be an essential thing for the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world, not just here or in our countries," she added.
China’s import trade fair is trying to mitigate criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its own companies.
The exhibition is attended by the heads of several states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to Statistics Lithuania, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50%, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, import volumes from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are worried that Chinese investments in Lithuania could bring undesirable political influence, and Beijing’s exceptional focus on Eastern Europe is breaking the unity of the EU.

The Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, a mobile signature provider, informs that the malfunction of the mobile signature system has been resolved and the service is working as usual.
Mobile signature resumed operation at 14:28.
The mobile signature system crashed at 9:52 a.m. on Monday.
Clients of telecommunications companies Bit<0xC4><0x97>, Tele2 and Telia suffered these failures.
SK ID Solutions has identified the cause of the malfunction, but does not disclose it for security reasons.
The company apologizes to consumers for the inconvenience.
SK ID Solutions specializes in international e-identification solutions.
They are Estonian state partners that issue certificates of national identity documents and give citizens of different countries the opportunity to connect to electronic services and submit electronic signatures.

The cause of the Lion Air crash has been revealed: the relatives of the dead are angry
The Indonesian airline Lion Air's black box data indicates a speedometer malfunctioning in at least four of its last flights, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Security Committee, said a similar incident occurred in the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one that crashed in the Java Sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta on October 29.
All 189 people on board died in the crash.
Many media reported problems with the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box, yes, the technical problem was actually the speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," Tjahjono told a news conference.
"The black box data showed that during the two flights prior to flight Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem," he added.
“There are a lot of rumours on social media.
We now want to clarify that there were four flights in the black box where there were problems with the airspeed meter," he said.
During a meeting with the families of the dead, Tjahjono said the information from the flight data recorder was consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed irregularly since the plane took off.
The search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said that a technical failure on the flight from Bali to Jakarta had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak by transport minister Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the investigation of the crash.
But he stood up and bowed his head as angry and grieving family members demanded Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, to present himself.
"Lion Air behaved improperly," said a man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion."
After the meeting, Kirana quickly left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of recognizing the dead.
Nearly 140 body bags loaded with human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the airliner was allowed to fly after it was put into service two months ago, despite a failure on its October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, including a sudden drop that frightened passengers shortly after taking off.
Lion Air said the incident had been resolved.
Is it true that the problem was solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
If not, the appropriate technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not say that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable under the law to prevent air crashes in Indonesia from happening again.
Tjahjono said the large amount of small wreckage and the fact that the wreckage spread over a relatively small area suggested the plane likely crashed into the water at very high speeds.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the engines of the plane, when it touched the water, operated at high revs, as shown by all the broken turbine blades," the official said.
The Lion Air crash is Indonesia's worst air accident since a Garuda plane crash near Medan in 1997, killing 234 people.
Rescue workers rescued from the wreckage: minors also injured
On Monday evening, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided on the road V<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ai<0xC4><0x8D>iai - Plung<0xC4><0x97>, near Tilvikiai.
The cars collided in the forehead, three people were reported to have been injured.
The BMW driver, born in 1999, is reported to have driven to the opposite side of the road and crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car carrying her father, born in 1967, and daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz was knocked out of her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
President: No artificial facilitation needed for referendum
When the Seimas approves the government's proposal to reduce the referendum bar for the currently more protected first section of the Constitution, the president will veto the amendments, her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97> said.
More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution, which is a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular in the articles in its first section, should certainly not be a smaller majority .
It is easy to predict that the president would veto it," Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s adviser to domestic politics told <0xC5><0xBD>ini<0xC5><0xB3> Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamentals of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so reducing the number of votes needed to change these articles would create a "negative precedent" and "unmanageable risks would open up", according to Ling<0xC4><0x97>.
"In the president's opinion, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, rather we need to prepare for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Seimas is due to vote on Tuesday on the amendment to the referendum law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Section One and Section Fourteen of the Constitution with a higher level of protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote in a referendum approve it.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace the articles of Section One and Section Fourteen of the Constitution by a referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half of the population would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - a million.
The proposal came after the Seimas in September approved the president’s veto on the amendments previously adopted by the parliament, which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes to change Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The reduction is proposed ahead of the referendum on dual citizenship, which is scheduled for May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are scheduled.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, may not have dual citizenship at this time, with some exceptions.
The world Lithuanian community is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - not enough people would come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports “bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka”, therefore they need to be renovated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to shrink, therefore it needs to be renovated, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
“Air transport infrastructure is already strained because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - this is not even part of long-term planning, it is the minimum that we must do," Masiulis said at a communication conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine "Valstyb<0xC4><0x97>" on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be particularly important as important projects will have to be implemented – the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of the outer port of Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of the outer port in Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da, clean up airports, maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We have to stay awake, start projects that will unlock our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis has repeatedly said that in recent years, too little money has been allocated to road maintenance.
“The state of the roads is not improving yet because the funds are not allocated enough.
We are struggling to build new roads, but even for essential maintenance, such as highways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount that should be spent on road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuania’s exports of transport services grew 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that hauliers from EU countries would be obliged to periodically return tractors to their country of registration.
“We need to make our exports in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd to suggest that trucks should return home on a regular basis, because empty trucks would be driving in Europe, burning fuel, increasing emissions.
Railways will benefit most from this, as the cost will increase so much that part of the transport will shift to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 people and employs more than 7,500 companies.
Conflict with Heritage Guards
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced to the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage, called the deliberations of Masiulis political pressure.
The building, built in the 1950s, is a treasure that was registered in 1993 and it is not for politicians but for specialists to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania’s image.
"Removing this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step, so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal could be built, so that when you come to Vilnius, you would feel in a modern country, and not in such an interesting, truly unrepresentative country as an innovative one," Masiulis said last week at the Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis also announced that a completely new passenger terminal was planned to be built in Kaunas and that the airport would be connected to the Rail Baltica gauge by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026, after the construction of Rail Baltica has been completed.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected to serve 4.8 million passengers, and next year it will serve 5 million people.
Last year Kaunas Airport handled a total of 1.2 million passengers.
What are Lithuanian troops doing in Afghanistan?

Next year will start direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar
Next spring, the largest regular passenger aircraft Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bea, which belongs to Madagascar, according to information provided by the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, the website madeinvilnius.lt.
Passengers of Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says he is trying to offer new holiday destinations to Lithuanian tourists.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the summer season of 2019.
For example, Novaturas and Ithaca will start direct flights from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to prepare for harder times.
For the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease," <0xC5><0xA0>apoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA reminds that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> are attending Eurogroup and EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) meetings in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that agreement be reached on how revenues generated from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed until there is agreement at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On October 23, the European Commission rejected Italy’s draft budget as not complying with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has used this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently it was the 120th anniversary of the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>nai municipality, then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai province.
Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the state of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-blowing national revival has called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Burachus - Bali, Jonas, Bronius - from the very depths of the village we have the creative power to engage in the cultivation, meaningfulness and preservation of our cultural traditions.
For more than 50 years, Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as has travelled his homeland with a camera in his hands, providing a wide and realistic view of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the surviving value of his work.
In the photographs of Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, Lithuanian landscape, mounds, our people, immortalized in everyday and festive environment, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant portion of the legacy of Bali Burach, dedicated to the description of national work customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite the two world wars and the heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in descriptions of the works of Samogitians, especially Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>nai, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>nai, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kiai, as well as the residents of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, over 400 rare photographs, mostly unpublished, were selected for this publication, which were grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture characteristic of Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>nai, Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kai and other districts of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija.

The tragic fate of the couple died after just a few hours of marriage.
A helicopter crash in southwest Texas killed a married couple just hours earlier.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 kilometres northwest of Juwaldi and 129 kilometres west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Strangely enough, the accident occurred after a flight of about 24 kilometers, exactly as the newlyweds were aged.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Samos Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday night at the Byler family ranch near Juwaldi and flew off in a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred after the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The couple were on their way to Sant Antonio International Airport on a plane for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain, and the hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
Lawrence has been a pilot of the family for many years.
Kennedy said he was piloting helicopters while serving in Vietnam.
The autopsy should reveal the pilot’s physical condition and whether it could have caused the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
Its wreckage spanned a rocky hillside and the hull remained "dangerously hanging", flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to take the debris away and then inspect it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined, and the NTSB’s preliminary report is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told MPs of his Likud party, his office said.
"Today is the day when, under President (Donald) Trump, the United States imposes particularly tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran since the beginning of efforts to curb his aggression," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would be a "decisive" strike on Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, described by Washington as "the toughest sanctions of all time", came after Trump's controversial May decision to withdraw from the world powers' nuclear deal with Tehran.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iranian oil exports, which have fallen by about one million barrels a day since May, and cutting Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran, saying it is too limited in scope and time.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighbouring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to take a military foothold there.
Other parties to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the US decision, saying the deal, as it was intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Judgment over the death of young motorcyclist
After the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Nordic town, the court will hear the testimony of a witness in the case of an accident that has ended.
The Vilnius Regional Court on Tuesday ruled that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case will be heard at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor's office disagrees with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the 79-year-old Eduarda Osipova from a motorcycle accident after announcing that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office is asking the district court to revoke the district court’s verdict, saying Osipov was the most guilty of the accident, while the district court’s findings were unfounded.
An acquittal is also requested by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, around 3 p.m., when an Osipov-driven car "<0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia" from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Street and collided with a motorcycle driving on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the driver of violating the road traffic regulations and caused a traffic accident, killing a man on a main road driving a Piaggo motorcycle.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver was killed, but after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Vilnius District Court judge Rolandas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas told BNS that experts had determined that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed in the area was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would go at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of a respected car claimed to have driven at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
When the driver saw the obstacle, he tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before he collided with the Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that Osipov, who was driving from the side road to the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner Mercenaries Killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian soldiers and six people belonging to the Wagner company.
This is reported by a Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
The source said one of the units of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps was stationed in the area, with many Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" joining it.
"Novaya Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for information on the fate of the Russians.
Former Belgian king to undergo paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had a love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to RTBF, he could go to the Supreme Court to oppose the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeals, Jacques Boel, a former husband of Delphin’s mother, is neither biologically nor legally the artist’s father.
Delphine has applied for a corresponding investigation in order to be recognized as the daughter of “real” father Albert.
CEC will distribute money to the parties, but will give nothing to social workers
This week, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Deputy Speaker of Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, is not yet scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they can be granted in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC, if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Mat<0xC5><0xA1>a<0xC5><0xA1>aityt<0xC4><0x97>, the chairwoman of the CEC, informed the V<0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xBD> that "the meeting of the commission is scheduled to take place on Thursday, where it is planned to take a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly budget subsidy to the parties".
According to her, the CEC must take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros, the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million euros, the non-partisan Labour Party - about 0.23 million euros.
Under the current law, which the CEC will follow when allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, established in spring this year, to expect to receive money from the budget.
The party has not yet participated in any elections.
However, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers get at least a couple hundred thousand euros ahead of three elections next year -- the local government, the president and the European Parliament.
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> vetoed the amendments adopted by the Seimas to the laws on political parties and this year's budget.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but government representatives Mr Kirkilas and Peasant-Green leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis say MPs will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible until the CEC meeting on Thursday, therefore, according to Mat<0xC5><0xA1>a<0xC5><0xA1>aityt<0xC4><0x97>, "the grants will be allocated according to the legal order that existed until now".
It is true that the head of the CEC has not ruled out that if the Seimas rejected the president's veto this week or next week and new amendments to the budget allocation for parties came into force, the commission could consider a decision on the allocation of an additional subsidy to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire legal environment in force in our decision, because we are the executive body responsible for enforcing the laws that are being passed," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject the veto and the new laws enter into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties by borrowing additional amounts.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.
<0xC5><0xA0>iauli<0xC5><0xB3> bankas used the results for the sale of shares
<0xC5><0xA0>iauli<0xC5><0xB3> bankas, which announced the results of the 3rd quarter, received the most attention on Monday on the Baltic Exchange, where the positive reaction was soon received by the sellers.
The Vilnius Stock Exchange Index rose 0.46% on Monday, shares in Riga overall dropped 0.49%, Tallinn Stock Exchange Index dropped 0.18%, OMX Baltic Benchmark dropped 0.07%.

Poroshenko: Activist Handziuk's killing orders must be punished
"I want to state that none of the versions - and there are more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be thoroughly checked in accordance with the test procedures.
As president, I have no opportunity and no obligation to receive information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he had the greatest interest in ensuring that the murder of Mr Handziuk was clarified and that the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of the crime "assumed the necessary responsibility".
"After the case has been requalified into murder, they are quite rightly and reasonably at risk of life imprisonment," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of law enforcement representatives in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they are".
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help to clarify the situation and would make everything even more confusing.
"I call on all pro-government and pro-opposition forces not to discard unsubstantiated arguments and, God defend, not to use this killing for public relations," he said.
On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast, so as to build public confidence.
There is simply no other way.”
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilize the country," he said.
Handziuk, an anti-corruption campaigner, was attacked in Kherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lutsenko resigned on Tuesday.
Since her death, public officials have been accused by public activists of failing to properly conduct the investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and Interior Minister.
"Today I am submitting my resignation," Lucenka told members of parliament in a reading of his investigation report.
Parliament still has to approve the prosecutor’s resignation.
Lucenka accused the activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduces toilet without water
In introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional toilets to non-water-supply systems to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that doesn't require water in plumbing pipes, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage types are processed into chemical fertilizers.
“The technology you see here is the greatest achievement in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Bill Gates told Bloomberg.
The technology toilet was created with the help of a charity funded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
For seven years, the fund spent <0x24>200 million on a plant that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water.
According to Bill Gates, about 20 models of toilets were created.
The installation is now complete and can be sold.
But in order to make such toilets mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another <0x24>200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year as a result of poor sanitation.
Fighting problems of poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing health spending to <0x24>233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates went to the toilet presentation jar with feces.
He said it was a good reminder that in the small example, "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 eggs of worm parasites."
S. Slyva elected president of the Mass Football Association
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association took place in Kaunas, where Sergejs Slyva was elected the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Association was convened due to the request of Anatoly Stetsenko to resign from the office of the President of the Association.
There were 13 members out of 15.
The main item on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates - Sergey Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis - took part in the elections.
Eleven members of the association voted for Slyva, two members voted for Rastenis.
Slyva will end Stekenko's term of office, which runs until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: People's deaths are worrying
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on the widespread use of a pesticide, amid concerns over dozens of recent poisonings in the country's west.
ANSES, the health agency, said the decision to ban all products containing methamphetamine came after a new safety check began earlier this year, ahead of at least three poisoning waves in the department of Arte and Loire that began in September.
As a result, the government has already suspended pesticide use.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used for about 700 tons a year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained of eye and throat irritation and breathing problems in the Angers region, where a lot of salads are grown.
"These episodes confirm the truth of our decision, but they did not rush it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Metam, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe, is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be a “probable human carcinogen.”
The pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is due.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, whether or not there are alternatives," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that salad growers, farmers in general, will face, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already voiced dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of throwaway in a region whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed annually in Europe.
There will be "much fewer salads, radishes and pairs" next season after the government halted the use of droppings last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Producers Federation, told AFP.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million invested in supermarket with observation wheel in Tallinn
Next weekend, a new shopping centre “T1” is opened in the Estonian capital, in which the local capital real estate development company “Pro Kapital Grupp” has invested EUR 70 million.
A total of 130,000 square meters, or 55,000 square meters rented, of the supermarket will have 150 stores or entertainment sites, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, the developer said in a statement.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolis" (together with the office area) is about 110,000 sq. m., and rented - 91,000 sq. m.
The T1 is the first supermarket with a rooftop observation wheel, according to the developer.
It will be operational at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gates will be integrated into the territory: trams will stop nearby, intercity buses will soon run.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also located nearby and it is estimated that it will serve 1 million passengers per year around 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says the global supermarket business is undergoing fundamental changes, and the development of the T1 has managed to be at the forefront of them.
“We have created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experiences that are unavailable online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthy attraction, and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a press release.
Great attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping center, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq. m., or a fifth of the total rented area, is allocated for entertainment at the object.
An exceptional accent is the spectacular wheel on the roof.
It will raise guests to an altitude of 120 m above sea level - in Tallinn only the TV tower is taller.
The trampoline park “Super Skypark” will be located underneath the observation wheel on the fourth floor and will open the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball field on the trampoline in Estonia, according to the company.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre promises to occupy children for at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also host a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema, which is shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to empathize with the virtual reality cinema with the interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and chairs moving according to the rhythm of the film, the feeling of realism here will be enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia’s tourism revenue by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to the financial statement of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, sales revenue of almost EUR 9 million and net profit of EUR 2.4 million were generated in the Lithuanian market.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon: President Paul Biya sworn in after controversial elections for seventh term
At a ceremony overseen by parliament speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Biya pledged to protect the West African state's "integrity and unity".
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the director, were kidnapped in a presbyterian school in the northwest, where English-speaking separatists are campaigning for independence.
The majority of Cameroon’s 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, demands for autonomy began to be made in the northwest and neighboring southwestern provinces as a result of discontent over alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, after Biya refused to make concessions, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia," and raised their weapons.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some crossing the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in undernourished forests.
Only 5 percent of voters in the Northwest region voted in October, compared to 15 percent in the Southwest province.
In both parts of the country, Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary elections: mistakes caused by inexperience
Something was missing - understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed access to their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths because we couldn’t buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who borrowed,” he said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their contents do not fundamentally change, and the violations themselves are not malignant in nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the elections were experienced - it was news for them as well.
Thus, not all of our actions were in line with our orders.
Therefore, we had to warn the CRC that the principles we described would be followed.
These complaints, however, do not give reason to doubt the results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas said.
According to the Chairman of the CRC, there have been cases when the ballot papers were not stamped - after learning about this, the unsealed ballot papers found in the ballot boxes were cancelled.
Some towns lacked space, but according to A. Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas, the complaints and violations relate to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a significant difference in the election results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas explained.
The turnout of party members was 55%, while the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people were on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday remain unchanged, with Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> winning with 79 percent (16418 votes) and Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas with 21 percent (4441 votes).
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97>’s candidacy in next May presidential elections.
Trump Says He Willn't Meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet with Putin in Paris this week to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on his way to the final rally ahead of the U.S. Congressional midterm elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure whether it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
“I’m not sure we’ll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
But he said the two will meet at the G20 summit and “probably meet many times” afterwards.
Trump continues to try to "reboot" relations with Moscow despite allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas requests annulment of VETEK decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, the former CEO of Santara Clinics at Vilnius University, is asking for the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (CEO) to be overturned, acknowledging that unreported transactions have violated the law.
Mr. Strup’s complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the VTEK on 23 May, the court representative Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduen<0xC4><0x97> told BNS.
Mr. Strup believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he says he has understood the exception to the law in this way.
In May, the VTEK announced that the Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and the Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97> had violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation, it was found that four transactions were declared in breach of the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank in 2010 with the spouse, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted to a natural person together with the spouse in 1996 and not recovered.
S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions by skipping the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Coordination of Public and Private Interests in the Public Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges to declare not only his or her own data, but also that of his or her spouse.
The study was conducted on the basis of information provided by Info TV.
It was clarified whether K. Strupas and his spouse, the Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, properly and in a timely manner declared their concluded transactions.
Last year, Strup gave his daughter a real estate worth 125,000 euros, according to Info TV.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinic and his wife did not include the data in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement, along with at least ten other people, has raised allegations of corruption in the investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public purchases of computers and software in clinics, companies were required to provide illegal financial compensation, and he was disguised as a support.
In this way, Mr. Strup is suspected of speaking at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology at Santara Clinics.
Mr. Strup himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strup, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his post as head of the Santara Clinic in September.
By the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, the employment relationship with K. Strup<0xC4><0x97> was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Professor Juozas Ristenskis continues to lead Santara clinics on a temporary basis until the competition to elect the new CEO takes place, and it is promised to be announced later this year.
Congratulations to L. Gutauskas on his anniversary
According to the President, Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, and opens up the wisdom and memory of the nation for a thousand years.
Favorite and appreciated works of the author - poetry, prose, children's literature, paintings, book illustrations - testify to Gutauskas being a multi-talented artist.
Congratulating the President on her honourable anniversary, she thanked the artist for his significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools want to teach differently: less tests, more practice
The Ministry of Education and Science is planning such changes in the curriculum, which was presented on Monday at the forum "Changes in the curriculum: foreign experience for decisions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius.
The Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>, who spoke during the discussion, said that over 30 million euros had been invested in updating the curriculum over the last ten years, but there were no results.
"According to the results of the International Student Achievement Survey PISA, students' achievements are below the average of OECD countries," said the Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on giving knowledge rather than on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programs focus on developing students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also necessary for children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
The Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, presenting the changes in the general curriculum, stated that the scope of renewing the programmes starting this academic year will decrease, they will be more specific, and the disciplines will be more closely connected to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, pupils’ education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent – they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of pupils’ assessment will change to a cumulative score, and the pupils’ competences acquired in an informal way will gain more weight.
Decrease in standardized tests.
Promising that general curricula will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, task bank.
The aim of the update of the curriculum is to improve pupils’ achievements by at least 10% in the international PISA survey, to reduce the gap between pupils’ achievements by a third, to acquire modern competences at school, and to be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget to upgrade the curriculum from May 2018.
It is planned that the project of general education curricula updated for the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in part of the schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism over the nearly 8 million euros project carried out by the Centre for the Development of Education for the renewal of the general curricula of primary, basic and secondary education.
7.8 million euros were earmarked for the four-year period, and the first procurement of 1.3 million euros was announced at the beginning of October.
After the experts criticized the purchase, it was suspended and the Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, the director of the Centre for the Development of Education.
How to respond to extreme flooding in Lithuania
Ten-day exercises to improve the authorities’ response to extreme flooding begin on Monday in Lithuania.
According to the Fire and Rescue Department, the exercises will examine how state institutions are prepared to work in the country after a state-level emergency, such as a flood, to deal with its consequences, coordinate the search for, rescue and urgent evictions of people from flooded areas, organize their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and provide other means of protecting the population.
The exercise will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries and other institutions of the country, as well as members of the emergency operations centers of 12 municipalities.
On November 5-13, a preparatory phase of the exercise will take place, during which municipalities, who have received information from the Hydrometeorological Service from PRT, will make decisions on emergency management.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During the event, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the Department, and the Emergency Operations Centres of the institutions will operate in state and municipal institutions.
When the Government declares a state-level emergency regarding the consequences of flooding, the Chief of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will direct the emergency response, elimination of its consequences, protection and rescue actions of the population and property.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, the deputy director of the PRTD, says that the main thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check how prepared the population, state and municipal institutions, agencies and enterprises are to be warned and informed about the imminent disaster, and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions".
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large amounts of water from flooded areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lutsenko resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuri Lutsenko announced his resignation Tuesday in the country's parliament over the resonance caused by the death of Katerina Gandziuk, an acid-filled anti-corruption fighter, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under Ukrainian law, a request for resignation must be submitted by the Attorney General to the President of Ukraine, who must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into Gandziuk’s murder order in the Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians in public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist and anti-corruption fighter who publicly spoke about police corruption in her hometown of southern Ukraine, Kherson.
On July 31, an unknown attacker, Mr. Gandziuk, splashed acid in the face outside her home.
She died in hospital on November 4 because of her injuries.
Protesters outside the Ukrainian Interior Ministry are demanding an answer on who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 people allegedly linked to the order for Gandziuk’s murder.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the study.
According to the Attorney General, due to the information leak, the suspects received essential information for them.
Lucenko added that she personally knew Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were exploiting her blood for public relations.
"In order for no one to have any reason to say that someone is holding on to the authorities, I want to state that I am making a resignation statement.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss the issue in parliament," Lucenko said in a statement in Rada, according to the newspaper Obozrevatel.
Lucenko added: "You cannot allow a dual government in a country where the law enforcement system is disrupted without any evidence, even for crimes discovered."
Lucenko is seen as a close associate of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who is suspected of covering up corruption among top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy <0xC5><0xBD>. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
According to Aurelija Vernickait<0xC4><0x97>, an advisor to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will focus on the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not follow the combined trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level, with a share of renewable energy of 6% in 2015.
The Commission estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various challenges, including the relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%), while electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has initiated a proposal to supplement the questions of the corruption investigation by the Conservatives’ appeal to the CT
The Seimas on Tuesday approved the proposal, which was registered by Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>, the leader of the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 MPs in favour, 27 against, and nine MPs abstained.
The draft will be discussed by the Seimas committees, with the Law and Order Committee headed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> as the main committee.
Upon its conclusion, a vote will be held on the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
Currently, the Seimas Temporary Investigation Commission, which is conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed extending the term by stating that "significant information has appeared in the public sphere about possible illegal influence and influence on political processes and state institutions".
In her draft, <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> describes “the possible representation of pension funds’ interests in the legislative process or when applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission”.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "Farmers" found out that the Conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund advocates in their appeal.
Influence on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) the leaders of the "Farmers" blame the former comrades Povilas Urb<0xC5><0xA1>is.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Municipalities could have instructed members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Commission's Prevention Division, Mindaugas Siauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas set up a commission to investigate the possible illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, the impact on the electoral process, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and public movements, legislative processes, the election of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, the appointment of members of management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at what information law enforcement and intelligence agencies have provided to the competent authorities and how they have responded to it.
Investigators are expected to submit their findings by May 1.
In the meantime, there will be a campaign for the presidential elections, for the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are "peasant" representatives.
Two social workers, one “ordinary man”, a liberal and a representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania-Christian Families Union, were also appointed as its members.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to take part in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union.
The National Security and Defense Committee's (NSGK) investigation on the same issues at the last session showed that the investigation needed to continue.
Germany's Internal Intelligence Director Lost His Post
Maassen, 55, has sparked controversy, saying "radical left forces" in Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not relocated, as previously promised, but forced to retire.
Last weekend, among other things, it emerged that at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organizations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen criticised Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a press conference Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "disappointed personally".
Seehofer, himself under pressure for both the dispute and the poor performance of his party in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen.
A series of shark attacks have frightened the entire island, killing a third person
The Queensland Ambulance Service said in a statement that the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist wounds" in the attack near Pentecostal island of Sid Harbor, off the coast of Queensland state.
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
The island of Pentecost is the largest of the archipelago's objects of the same name, attracting many amateurs of diving and sailing from all over the world.
Shark attacks in the region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last shark attack in the archipelago took place in 2010.

Chubby girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
Chubby girl with white blown bride dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan floating towards the altar be larger than size S or M and still look attractive?
Plus-sized reality show "Size (r) Evolution" participants will already today prove that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all -- one of the girls on the project tonight will shed tears of happiness -- her boyfriend will appear on the set of the film.
“There are still some who think that the bigger girls don’t get the attention or look of the guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require me to have a standard-compliant figure," Aurika will speak with the wedding dress before the show.
A wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, a garment - it's a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less self-confident.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the entire commission – the plus size fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskiene, the photographer and social media star Nagliu Bierancas and TV producer Laura Pauk<0xC5><0xA1>te.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of quarrels among the jury members - after all, we all represent different spheres and differently imagine the winner of the show.
The task of displaying wedding dresses was made even more difficult, and it is - I can now reveal - that there were two newcomers who were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense," says Kalinkin.
Newcomers - 23-year-old Ieva, who was famous for her scandalous behavior in a summer reality show, and 31-year-old Dovil<0xC4><0x97>, a mother of two exceptionally beautiful children - as well as other girls, participated in the "Size (r) evolution" selection and ranked in the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session in the streets of Vilnius, the girls had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK viewers, who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
The internationally acclaimed reality show of plump beauties is taking place in Lithuania already for the second week - here plus-sized girls are competing for the name of the first in the country plus-sized star.
There are only eight left so far, and they all know that there can be only one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r) evolution" begins already this Monday evening at 20.30 a.m. at LNK.
Actor Ivan Elba elected to be the sexiest man in the world
People magazine has named the world’s sexiest man of the year.
He is 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected, he was not laughing at the new title.
I thought, "You can't!
Seriously?"
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - and the actor laughed.
To be honest, Idriss described the title as a very pleasant feeling that impressed his ego.
The British star says he has often received insulting words and bullying that made his childhood difficult because he was "very tall and awkward," he said.
The young actor did not convince his peers and became the subject of bullying also because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew my mustache and muscles, I became the coolest guy in my neighborhood," Idriss smiles.
When a man doesn’t have to be proud on these screens, Elba works as a DJ at parties in Spain and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, he enjoys Thai boxing and has a stimulus for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own line of clothes.
The British actor says his family is the most important thing in the world and is planning a wedding with his fiancee Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba has been voted the 33rd sexiest man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was awarded to Blake Shelton.
A man beaten dead during drinking
On Monday night, a man was beaten to death during drinking in the village of <0xC5><0xA0>alvi<0xC5><0xA1>kiai, in <0xC5><0xA0>irvintos district.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drink.
The doctors confirmed the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was arrested with 2.53 drunkenness.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Controllers no longer require a distance of 20 km for the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration power plant is being built, near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nai market.
The government is no longer seeking to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements during the construction of waste incineration plants.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, head of the Environmental Protection Committee “Farmer”, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law at the Seimas on Monday, by which he renounced such a requirement.
According to Ms Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the "Farmers" group, which previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its abandonment.
Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika’s amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants may be built in accordance with the statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He acknowledges that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about the ban.
"Given the definition of the residential area, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find such a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built," the committee chairman said.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the president’s veto amendments to tighten up the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants less than 20 km from the settlements, the amendment provided for the government to make decisions on the future of the two already under construction plants, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provision does not suggest any adjustments.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is being built by the energy group Lietuvos Energija, and in Kaunas – together with the Finnish energy concern Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da.
Possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the difficult Northern Ireland issue, which is disrupting Brexit talks, Dublin said.
In a phone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called backstop deal mechanism to leave the border between Northern Ireland and the European Union's Republic of Ireland open.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar vowed to consider the proposal, but ruled out any possibility of Britain's unilateral withdrawal from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation, May "has raised the possibility of reviewing the backstop mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar has signalled that he is open to reviewing new offers, provided that the result of such review is not linked to a unilateral decision to end the backstop," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators have not found an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the land border between the UK and Ireland as Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
The two sides agreed on "countermeasures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a broader trade deal is signed to ensure that additional customs checks are not carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain's unilateral withdrawal from the backstop agreement in three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"Three-month or limited-term hedging measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed a breakthrough in Brexit talks following a weekend announcement in Britain that a deal was at hand.
"I would say we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," May's spokesman in London said.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel Laureates Call for Access to Reliable Information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, and the Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that "the global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
“People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of a commitment to truth, principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of establishing facts.”
The document calls for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who has often criticised "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should take a position on the issue when they meet at the "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories said.
The declaration was drafted in two months under the leadership of Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based group for media freedom and journalists' rights.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were unanimously approved in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs of the Seimas, said, regarding the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
It also adapts its provisions to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law is better and more concretely distributed among all the actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because entities who have paid fines continue to commit repeated violations," said A. Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give market surveillance authorities more powers and establish a clear system for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities’ state control of product safety has not granted the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises of manufacturers and suppliers, to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the assessment of the Ministry, the time limit of six months for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish an infringement, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law – 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to introduce an obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product, thus ensuring its traceability, in order to facilitate market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings and premises of economic operators that manufacture and place products on the market, and to carry out inspections when carrying out state controls on product safety.
Increased fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who made them available on the market or a service provider who provided or provided dangerous services would be subject to a fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now from EUR 144 to EUR 1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (CPCA) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (now from 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, recall them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792).
If dangerous products have caused damage to the consumer's health, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11,584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,166) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria a fine of up to 25 thousand euros (no minimum amount has been set) is imposed for violation of product safety legislation, in Belgium a fine from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros, in Romania a fine from 155 euros to 6 666 euros, and in Bulgaria a fine from 125 euros to 7 500 euros.
10-Year-Old Has A Baby: A Family Member Has Been Raped
The events in Colombia have stunned millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl who was raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby came to the world through Caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby are well.
Doctors have been watching them for a while.
It still takes some time for the young mother and baby to be released home.
"According to the information I received from police, the little girl became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member, a brother," the director of the hospital where the child was taken told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating a case of rape and violence against a child.
Norwegian Armed Battalion Participates in NATO Exercise in Outermost and Hardest Areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
It is part of the NATO Exercise Triangle 2018, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from Norway’s second battalion after the 9/11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan, that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are skilled in the Arctic warfare, and this skill is particularly useful now that NATO is changing the direction of its attention.
In recent days, soldiers have taken part in staged battles against true British soldiers in the mountains east of Tinsett, often in the most remote and harsh areas.
Warriors have the skills to survive in this cold wild, but in a harsh climate they have to pull a much larger weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers in the QG say they share their skills to survive and fight in these conditions with other NATO troops.
The military said the drills, which resemble no other drills, would teach them how to be prepared in the event of a serious threat.

The Huddersfield Town vs Fulham in London ended in a hosts win with a minimum score of 1:0 (1:0).
The defensive football duel caught the attention of the spectators, as both teams fought for the most important 3 points, and the winner of the match was not clear until the last minute.
However, the hosts retained the lead and prevented Fulham from breaking the tie.
Fosu-Menshah scored his only and victorious goal in the 29th minute.

Deputy Chief of Staff has no plans to return to politics.
Former Kaunas Deputy Mayor Povilas Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis, who left his job in the municipality and the Unified Kaunas organization for support to Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas in the presidential election, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I’m going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies and also have ideas for new projects.
Most importantly, I will be happy to spend more time with my family," Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis told BNS.
He also said he did not plan to take part in the next municipal elections.
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis has not yet had the opportunity to talk to U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas after he lost to Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> the primary elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats on Sunday.
"To be honest, we haven't been able to discuss the results with him and the team in detail yet and talk about our plans for the future.
It is clear that after Vygaudas withdrew from the further election fight this stage of my life is over," Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis said.
He said he did not regret his decision to leave Kaunas for support to U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas, but only regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations".
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis worked briefly as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and later returned to this position after the successful elections of the “United Kaunas” in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school Erudito Lyceum and several other companies.
Workers in Kaunas Castle: What are they doing here?
The residents of Kaunas, having noticed the workers working in the Kaunas Castle, hoped that the reconstruction of the remaining tower was finally underway.
The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>ied<0xC4><0x97>lis assured the portal kauno.diena.lt that the south-western tower with a defensive wall fragment is undergoing work on changing the protective roof covering.
According to the speaker, the canopies will be cans.
"In the emergency, the worn-out tin coating posed a threat to those around us - people could fall and get injured - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the heritage was also damaged," the director of the museum explained.
Will this be similar to what happened a few centuries ago?
"All works are in coordination with heritage and other institutions," he added that he wanted the result to be as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side was important - the canopies must protect the values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution has been chosen.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin during the Soviet period, so they no longer had historical value," the director of Kaunas City Museum elaborated.
The contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the works will not take longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the museum director said.
According to him, the value of the works carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the speaker, was included in this year’s budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija".
Kauno. diena.lt has written, as according to research conducted, Kaunas castle may have looked earlier.
US and South Korea resume naval exercises
A naval drill will now be held in the southern city of Pohang for two weeks with about 500 troops, the defence ministry said.
The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been conducting joint military manoeuvres for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "prepared for invasion".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program if Washington did not lift economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered," the North's foreign ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that the sanctions would remain until Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

The Centre for Eastern European Studies will cooperate with two famous US "brain centers"
According to the head of EESC Linas Kojala, who is based in Vilnius and has already been working for thirteen years, networking in the USA will allow the implementation of projects and make the voice of Lithuania more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niche activities, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of Eastern Partnership countries that we are analysing are also a priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the EESC and the US authorities will work together to prepare applications for transnational projects, exchange of expertise and expertise, and carry out expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FSA has been in operation since 1955 and unites nearly a hundred top analysts.
In the University of Pennsylvania's latest global ranking of analytics centers, the FSA ranked seventh in its category.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have repeatedly been invited to consult and work for top U.S. political institutions, scores 10 in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to penetrate the U.S. information space and will encourage us to raise the quality bar," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the upcoming EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision makers and in the public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of implemented projects and is not maintained by targeted grants.
The EESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapse in Marseille
Two people were slightly injured in the collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire service said.
As the buildings collapsed, debris appeared on the street, dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters, some with trained dogs, were working at the scene near the famous old port of Marseille.
The local prefecture posted pictures on Twitter showing a pile of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap where buildings stood, firefighters working on the scene, and dust-covered cars.
Authorities said they were looking for people who might have fallen under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
The amateur video, which was shown on BFM-TV, showed dust clouds in the street and sleeved mouths of passers-by.
Photos taken on Google Street View before the incident showed that one of the collapsed buildings was five-storey and the other was six-storey.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, closed with large cracks in the facade.
Sabine Bernasconi, mayor of the Marseille district, said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
However, she could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used arbitrarily by residents.
The region's prefecture urged people to avoid the site and clear the way for rescue services.
Sabine Bernascon, mayor of the Marseille district, said the building was in poor condition and was ordered to be evacuated.

Afghan Special Forces officer kills American instructor during training
North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor, 39, was on vacation for a year to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Forces Headquarters, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. military member, whose name has not yet been disclosed, was wounded in a Saturday attack that killed Taylor.
Officials say Taylor died of infantry gun fire.
Utah National Guard Commander Major General Jefferson S. Burton told reporters Taylor had helped train and strengthen Afghan National Army capabilities.
Utah media quoted NATO as saying Taylor had been shot dead by a trained special forces soldier and that the attacker had been killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are due to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, which was his second mission in Afghanistan.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors from a special forces battalion.
Hundreds of North Ogden residents gathered in the streets of the city of about 17,000 to escort their mayor, who was accompanied by police.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
