Welsh parliamentarians worried about "looking like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were astonished at the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at the political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said his group was worried "that it is rime with Twp and Pwp".
Not for Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "kaka".
A member of Plaid's assembly said the whole group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that it was the abbreviation of the word from MWP to "doll".
The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly commission, which is currently working on draft legislation to change the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which received strong support for the name of the Assembly Parliament of Wales.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but during the public consultation MWP received the greatest support.
The assembly obviously offers alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement could be a headache for the presidency official, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the design of the Committee's system.
During the discussion of legislation, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question of how they should be called.
Macedonia votes in referendum on name change
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour evokes claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the plebiscite to change the name, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
During the hardships of Harlem, the bells of St. Martin and other churches fell silent
"The old people I talked to said that historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
“You won’t find one or the other today.”
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"People are talking differently these days," he said.
“The bars are no longer the neighborhood where people come together all the time.”
Speaking of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for the long term, as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with cooperative apartments, where people who do not help the surviving sanctuaries will live.
“Most of the people who buy cooperative apartments in these apartment blocks will be white, and so they will hurry up to the moment that the churches are completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built in 1870 by White Congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolis community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation was established in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks, which held a service nearby, took over the name of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a congregation of blacks with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main Harlem store, where blacks were refused to be employed or promoted.
The building was severely damaged by fire in 1939, but since the parishioners of spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Clergyman David Johnson, son and successor of the spiritual father Johnson in the church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon the bells of the poor.
The experts who played the carillon in July called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that this was the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lindas. 18 years ago, he started playing a larger carillon at the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that the church of St. Martin did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story involving architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by the Church’s laymen, others by the Episcopal Church’s diocese.
Zacristia, a parish governing body made up of lay leaders, expressed concern to the diocese in July that the diocese would "endeavour to pass on the costs" to the sacristy, even though it had not hired the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Lobster in California
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was catching lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
It was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he dive with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then arrived with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried about catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I was bitten!”
Hammel said that as he approached the boy, he noticed that all of his keybone had been loosened.
“I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: ‘A shark is swimming in the water!’
The boy was taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was found in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a statement that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments, where specialist consultants will work.
As the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market continues to grow and fashion and household goods sales fall, larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more stores will be built next year.
Investments in beauty are on the rise, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves once designed for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in brand zones similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also releasing its “Boutique” makeup range, most of which is vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open later this year in Selby Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities every day from local supermarkets, supermarkets need to do more to attract people to visit.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said branded outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as supermarket chains try to counter cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and also installed a number of Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which are said to have boosted food sales and made them more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
In the early 1920s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the alliance ended with a dispute over how to allocate revenue from supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-storey pharmacy business to Celesio three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was claimed that Lloyds’ contribution to the plan added an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the plan in four stores.
Sainsbury’s Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is 'furious' over Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby terminated a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning said she was leaving on Instagram.
After Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, she angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when a golden television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Bakinghamshire, admitted she wouldn't have enough time to devote to his Truly brand of household utensils and accessories due to new deals of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was supposed to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his summer cottages.
The source said Truly had been one of Holly’s top priorities so far.
This should have been its long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlou headquarters has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell items."
Experts believe the departure of The Morning host, one of Britain’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions due to massive investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and household items, as well as delays in starting things.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby and Cappa founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity” host Anta McPartlin.
A close Jones source said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business.”
We talked deeply and we fell in love.
He joked about the media’s criticism of a comment that some might view as “unpresidential” and because it was positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so much?
A brief, ridiculed voice from the "newscaster" said:
“I didn’t refuse anything.”
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving an "appropriate response" from the US over North Korea's early disarmament.
He said the U.S. would instead continue sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
We are going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests were over, he helped free hostages and he returned the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual attitude when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people to enter this stuffed arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastate the island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was deployed, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that there is no need for international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether employees working abroad will be able to work on the ground.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the announcement, is likely to have increased the number of lives lost.
Travelling in the best time between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
As a result of natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will reach the site of the next disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen to rebuild Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure as the centre of his electoral campaign and has generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not bother Yoko’s administration, as he will be re-elected next year.
Yoko also faces pressure over continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority hold a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrow bows and other simple weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a distant levelling goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in Chelsea's Premier League game by scoring a goal at Stamford Bridge stadium in London on Saturday.
As their team lagged 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball to former Sturridge about 30 meters from Chelsea.
He throws the ball on his left leg and shoots towards the far-flung.
The ball, raised high above the penalty area, flew to the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually flew over the leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
"I was just trying to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to keep as much time as possible for the shot," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante running, I corrected the ball with one touch, and without thinking too much, I just kicked.”
Belgium’s Eden Hazard scored a 25-minute goal for Chelsea from the first half by 1:0.
In that attack, the Blue striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacici in the middle of the field and rushed toward Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, he quickly played the wall.
He then shoots the ball between the opponents and Hazard, who runs towards the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and pushed the ball through Liverpool player Alison Becker with his left leg towards the net at the far-flung.
Liverpool will play against Naples at the Stadio San Paolo (Italy) on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused six-meter waves.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, was covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after stabbing a woman
The murder investigation began after a woman's body was found in Berkenhead this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. outside Greison Miuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people who have seen or heard the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "At this stage of the investigation is early, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something with a video recorder and would contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Berkenhead resident and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police have reported that they are informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grace Mouse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one could enter or leave the building.
He lost his voice when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
A police officer told one person that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared to be shaken at the scene.
She said, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the barrier on the inside, and another van behind the barrier on the outside.
Many officers stood on the inner side of the barrier and watched the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 on September 30th.
Parliament’s Cromwell statue is hit by the last blow of the “rewriting of history” dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, which resembles the Taliban’s actions, and which is the responsibility of Cromwell’s fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the relocation of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s statue at Westminster Palace inevitably had to become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps it is not Cromwell who will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The wonderful image of Cromwell created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft is a reflection of the attitude of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps more numerous than today in the late 19th century, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is accurately depicted is still disputed by historians.
It is clear that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as the defender of the Lord are also worthy of commemoration and honor."
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
The Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man named Yuan had been found dead. He was bleeding due to a damaged artery and was lying next to a pigsitter at the Lupanshui Market in Guizhou Province, southern China.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Singh, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to inject the vaccines into pigs.
He said Wednesday that he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province were going to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found a relative dead and found an open door to the nearby pigeon.
He said that there was a large boar in the pighouse, whose mouth was tainted with blood.
According to the report, the forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had torn the farmer.
Guiyang Evening News quotes: "My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, who named him Wu.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan or his cousin did not belong to the animal that tore the man.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked in to prevent other people from being attacked and kept while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for the loss of life.
There have been few cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was extremely dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a 295-kilogram pig pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and pushed it until the animal was driven away by his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that they may taste blood.
“They are just playful.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's 'residues' will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Roza is expected to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday, at 5:00 a.m., Rosa moved at a speed of 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane, 620 km southwest of Cape Euchenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side, an elongated low-pressure area begins to form and move eastwards towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa will approach the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to carry a large amount of tropical moisture to the north, southwest of the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching elongated low-pressure area, will then bring widespread heavy rainfall to the south-west in the coming days.
At a location between 2.5 and 10 centimeters, rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flow and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, rainfall will fall from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in southwestern regions, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
In the event of a tropical storm, a particularly bad idea would be to take you to the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms would cause wind and dust.
The approaching stretched low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
More than 1 centimeter of precipitation is expected, which can cause a small stream of debris, and roads can become slippery.
This would be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some of the rainfall will start approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, and then spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains from the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
Intense temperature fluctuations are possible across the U.S. in October, as the Arctic cools, but in the tropical zone it will be fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge temperature changes over small distances.
Sunday was a great example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) vary by almost 20 degrees from those in St. Louis and Di Moine (Iowa).
In the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
The Great Southern Plains to the northeast are expected to be warm in October, with temperatures of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the central and eastern United States.
Temperatures in New York are expected to rise to 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October will be above the average perennial temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched in six television broadcasts on Thursday as supreme court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and woman Christine Blasey Ford were accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
But the political stalemate continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programs over Friday's last-minute change: an Arizona senator drafted an agreement to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long probe into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, after drinking at a high school party, was grabbing her and trying to take her off her clothes.
Kavanaugh was angry at witnessing that he was absolutely certain that this was not the case.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the broadcast.
The company estimated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting people watching television in offices.
To make it clearer, it is the same audience size as it would be in a playoff football match or an Oscar award.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, ranked first among all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers over the entire day.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
There was a great deal of interest after the hearing.
The main figure in Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he attempted to take an elevator to a court committee hearing.
CNN filmed him directly with his eyes down as people floated him.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator closed, he added that he would have more to say at the court committee meeting.
Subsequently, cable and broadcast networks discussed live when the Judicial Committee voted for Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations, which the Democratic minority called for, in the coming week.
Flake, speaking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partially convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice had power because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British prime minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Sunday Times of planning to leave critics of the European Union "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview posted on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit checkers plan that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, saying it was "absolutely absurd."
Police arrest suspect Dieteon Simpson over death of LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department said 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson had been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson’s DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he shot Wayde to death.
The lawyer informs that the bail for his release is <0x24>350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Experts' Service released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a shot in the head that leaned to the neck.
The department allocates merits to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and district residents who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for "scrupulousness and administration of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at the LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds during the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocking" and "shocking".
"That's what we're thinking about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spits ash in Mexico City
Volcano Popocatepetl erupted ash that reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after crater activity was intensified and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre watched a lot of thunders and quakes.
Photos on social media showed thin ash-covered car windshields in the area of Mexico City, such as Chochimilk.
Geophysicists have noticed that the activity of a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital has increased since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Ahead of independence anniversary, police clash with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's separatist vote.
Masked separatist group riot police were blasted with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Police used sticks to end the fight that started later in the day.
Within hours, the pro-independence groups chanting “Unforgettable, Impardonable” faced unionist protesters shouting, “Long live Spain!”
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region’s quest for independence.
Most voters chose to become independent, but due to the large number of boycotts, voter turnout was low.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as police across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations.
Independence groups set up a camp Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
Narcisso Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about Catalonia's prospect of independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents gladly shout at those who can vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a vital and hard-won victory in last December's regional election, Catalonia's independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year when many of their most prominent leaders have either gone into voluntary exile or are detained awaiting trial over their role in organising a referendum and then proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who supports the police and filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"Tensions are constantly rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would stand for European elections next year.
"Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonder: Arrested men entering the house by car
The three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been fired with a balloon.
Menga wins Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers, forcing Ibrox manager Steven Gerrard to lose his second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga's shot was very important, as in a moment Gary Holt's team leveled up with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains defeated in this Premier League season and will meet the Hearts next Sunday, where they are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will play the Europa League match at home against the Vienna Rapid.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its unmatched game series to six, and head coach Holt has not yet tasted the defeat, as Kenny Miller was replaced only last month.
Livingston missed a chance in a match with a steep guest
Even before the Holt team scored a goal, due to their perseverance, which poses various problems for the Rangers, they had long been in the forefront.
At first, Scott Robinson broke out and hit across the gate, but later Alan Lithgow was unable to reach the ball passing by Craig Halkett's head while slipping, and the ball rolled off the gate.
The hosts weren’t worried about letting the Rangers play at the front because they knew they could cause trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
That is how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly handed the ball over to Menga, who, stopping, scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the Rangers have been in possession of the ball for a longer time, but the hosts' defense was insurmountable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was almost out of work.
This game continued in the second half, although Kelly had to work on repelling Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman shot the Rangers with Allan McGregor's leg, and after another shot from Livingston's Lithgow's standard position, the ball flew next to the goal.
While passing, the ball was constantly in the Livingston penalty area, but every time it was kicked out, and two requirements for a penalty were not met: one for Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton, who came out after being replaced, and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Analysis of the phenomenal performance of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game of Livingston and the result.
All of them were excellent and they continued to exceed expectations for the ever-improving game.
The style of the game and the staff hasn’t changed since returning to the top league, but it’s worth it to give Holt a great deal of merit, because he came and ignited the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played a brilliantly organized defense, while Menga valued Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla to remain vigilant.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They played well under Gerrard's leadership, but this time they were lacking to reach their level.
They made few decisive kicks and only once broke through the defense of the hosts. A certain alarm bell to the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was met in Cologne in various ways.
On Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and a blue sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to rebuild relations between NATO allies.
Leaders debated issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to Turkey’s largest population outside of Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many Kurds, have also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to meet him in their own country.
Various protests show a division of visitors: some German Turks see him as a hero, while others flock to him and call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist has died in London after colliding with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10.15 a.m. at BVL.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred several months after another cyclist on Childers Street was killed by a culprit who then fled, about 1.6 kilometres away from the accident on Saturday.
City police said they were trying to identify the person and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
"Long Lartino" prison: six officers injured in turmoil
Prison services said six prison officials were wounded in a major turmoil in a high-security men’s prison.
The turmoil occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. at BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officials were summoned to deal with this upheaval, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officers are being treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison services said: "In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff have been summoned.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly will spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot suppression officials were summoned to jail to deal with a serious turmoil in which some workers were thrown at billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its sudden floods (the dry areas could benefit)
Tropical depression isn’t common to hit Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen next week when Hurricane Roza with its rest of energy sweeps through the southwest of the desert, causing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already said it was witnessing sudden flooding in western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday toward south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to get straight to Phoenix on Tuesday as she approaches the rain late Monday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their status of tropical storms or tropical depression within 322 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the border with Arizona.
Using the latest models from the National Hurricane Center, it is predicted that between 5 and 10 centimeters of rainfall will fall, and in some areas of Mogolon Rim in Arizona, it will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimeters, with rainfall of up to 10 centimeters in some areas.
For people who are not threatened by sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some may benefit from these precipitations, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, which falls into the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels toward the coast across the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still a hurricane with a massive wind of 137 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Cape Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm collides with cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore calms down.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, 8 to 15 centimeters are expected, but possibly up to 25 centimeters of rainfall," Weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, and head across Arizona towards southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her residues is very high rainfall in the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
The rains are expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods, a stream of debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Assault on Midsamer Norton: Four arrested suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace area at around 04.00 a.m., according to BVL, on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
Police in Avon and Somerset said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock district.
Officers appealed to anyone who could have any mobile phone footage of what had happened.
He said Kavanaugh was “suffered by the disgust and anger of the Democratic Party.”
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the disgust, anger, of the Democratic Party" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday to Congress’ strong and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified on his charges at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said: "The Americans saw Kavanaugh's cool, noble and brave on that day.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, that is, a lawyer with a credible reputation for public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also talking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“We have five weeks left to the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not here, but I’m actually there,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said Democrats wanted to "resist and obstruct".
A senior assistant to GOP executives told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll continues to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were thrown at the beach by massive waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu on Friday when waves of six meters of height began to strike the coast after dark, many of them having been fatally thrown away and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they were the victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't go away alone, it pulled cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the tsunami hit the coast, the tsunami was travelling at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centers.
Air photographs from the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town continued to be shaken by repeated strikes.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Applications (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's extremely violent quake was about 200 times as much as that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The tsunami was reported to have intensified due to the geographic location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 kilometres north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks were "completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
It was said that "this could be seen as a tragedy, but the situation could get even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came after a warning was issued.
In the shared social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting at people on the streets about a tsunami coming.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted electricity supply, cutting off the communications networks around Palu and making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate assistance.
Authorities said the military had started sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still needed food and other essentials.
The airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba reported that while World Vision staff were safely travelling from Donggala to Palu, where they hid in tents built in the office yard, the images were devastated along the way.
"They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when the relief teams began to take difficult steps to provide relief in the event of a disaster, some people complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, provisioning, and foreign personnel can only assist once the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can call for international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would impact the gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been crushed under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesia's national paraglider coach, Gendon Subandono, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Because I’m older in paraglider sports, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon described in detail how, in the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, the news traveled through the paraglider sports community, sending messages desperately using the WhatsApp app to Palu rivals who attended the beach festival.
But there was only one gray, not two blue ticks in his messages.
“I think that means there were no messages,” he said.
ATM robbers steal <0x24>26,750 at Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car was putting out the ATM in the entertainment complex and ready to add more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man “runned from behind the back of the Brink’s worker” and stole a bag of money to replenish.
Witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been known as "Ye" for some time and has named his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He is supposed to replace singer Ariane Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," he said.
It’s not just an abbreviation of the current professional name — West said earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, referring to the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into Ye, which means our reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
“The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names of Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has vowed not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
López Obrador vowed Saturday not to "use military forces to tame the Mexican population."
On October 2, 1968, while leftist student movements began throughout Latin America, military personnel fired on the square for a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people.
López Obrador has solemnly pledged to support young Mexicans by subsidising students every month and opening more free public universities.
Unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal groups, he said.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that there is no official AI strategy in the U.S. at all.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to lead the way in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and ahead of the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will be in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures and has invested in Face+, one of China’s most renowned artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked with an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China Branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee argued that U.S. researchers often have to struggle to win government grants.
"It's not China taking academic leaders away, it's companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council announced its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
In addition, Lee said China’s National Science Foundation is funding people from academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are giving money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the coming months, however, nothing has been done about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia votes in referendum on whether to change name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country's name to Republic of North Macedonia, an action to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say changing the name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether voter turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
A referendum question was put on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would follow the vote and make it decisive.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
But the turnout was just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country to open the way for joining NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents built by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up rather than passing through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, would attract much-needed investment.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a “yes” result would be “ensuring our future.”
According to a poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43% of voters are expected to vote in the referendum, below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma, 57% of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote “yes”.
For a referendum to be successful, 50 percent of the voters must vote, plus one vote.
Failure would be the first serious failure of the pro-Western government since it took power in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero defeats all of Brighton's defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton, and Manchester City won 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, seemingly incredibly easy.
The Argentinean striker got the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the offensive.
Before breaking into the open field, he ran between three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players wearing a green shirt.
He broke through one defender, before passing a few others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then passed the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward kicked the ball back from the penalty area with one kick to Aguero and this right foot kicked the ball to the right side of the gateway, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has foot problems," City chief Pep Guardiola told reporters.
He said he would play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues take the lead in this Premier League game.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero to received the ball during the attack while in the depths of the Brighton court.
Along the left edge of the pitch between the two opponents, he handed the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane threw the ball forward with several kicks as Sterling pushed toward the farthest vibe.
The Sky Blues throw the ball at the goal just before slipping out of the field.
At 12:55 on Tuesday, City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group match at the Rhein-Neckar arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were no good reasons to force again.
Competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to survive in the playoffs; in the West, they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, which defeated the Nationals by 5:2 on Friday night, at least secured a chance to get a preference but will still have to work hard to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get out on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where crowds and other teams will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
“Why not talk?”
The Nationals haven't announced the start of Sunday's game yet, but they're clearly inclined to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be 34 in the barrel, made a throw on Thursday and will take the thrower’s position on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
Washington’s right-hander stats this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 auts in 220 2/3 quarters.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president implicitly refers to the situation regarding Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be put on the scale in November.
Five weeks to the most important elections in our lives.
“It’s very important, I’m not running... but I’m actually running, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see how this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don’t care what they hurt, what they went over to get power and control; that’s what they really want – power and control – but we won’t give them that.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And you see this for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wicked, ugly, low-tempered and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked huge ovations.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, how.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one thing -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate openly expressing their opinions.
When the “Momentum” activists in my local party voted to mistrust me, I wondered if it was surprising.
Finally, I am the newest of the Labour MPs to be told that I am undesirable, and that is for what I have said.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticising me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on the importance of national security, on the importance of Europe, it is ironic that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues.
In a statement on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said: "We want a large number of members to be involved in the meetings and the meetings to be productive."
For most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour MP, Friday evening GC meetings were exactly that.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is far from the same and that the promises of a “milder, more pleasant” policy have long been forgotten, even if they have ever been implemented.
It is becoming increasingly evident that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues who I had previously believed had similar political views began to expect me to turn around 180 degrees and stick to opinions I would never agree with, whether for national security or for the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what -- there is a tirade of insults on social media that encourage my withdrawal, condemn the centre's policies, and say that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
In fact, I am far more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with every procedure of "distrust" or change in the electoral system, this party becomes smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that encourages me not to dance, not to speak so loudly, and then “everything will be okay with me.”
But that’s not what I came into politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s negligence, which literally led to the collapse of my entire classroom, I have been trying to win better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hid my policy, including my recent elections.
Nobody at Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political views and areas of disagreement with current leaders.
To those who promoted the procedure on Friday, as the country is struggling towards Brexit, which will hit households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in fact, one message I have in Nottingham’s Momentum addressed to my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of revocation or political expediency will stop me from acting in my own beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 Invincible Ayr wins table tops
Two late attempts distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the spectacular, breathtaking Tennant's Premiership day.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one that has not been defeated.
Eventually, the victory was brought to them by impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've put all the tests on all the games we've played so far and we're still unsuccessful, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “Ayr was good, players used their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, led Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score and Baggot stopped the failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage by a fine when he scored points in the middle of the race and successfully completed a personal test, helping Ayr to break off by 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggott successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The game was suspended for a longer time because Ruaridh Knott was severely traumatized and taken out of the box on a stretcher. Ayr continued to push forward after Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Climo.
Ayr Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose tried to take advantage of the overplayer, but Bruce Colvine's attempt failed after the fierce pressure ended.
The home team player returned, but after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the penalty line for the Ayr's ongoing fight.
Clim successfully completed his attempt, as he had done since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe detained David Armstrong’s kick into the corner of the pitch and prevented the country’s striker, Gregor Henry, from attempting the fifth home team to score points.
“Still Game” star seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector after it turned out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writing and acting with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and it seems that Kirenan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, although sources from Scottish Sun suggested that Kieran was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business."
'We own the sea': Bolivia imprisoned on land hopes court will reopen ocean road
The seamen are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flag of the ocean blue flies on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the slogan: “We have the right to own the sea.
Getting it back is our duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, imprisoned on land, the memories of access to the ocean, which Chile was forced to sacrifice in the 19th-century bloody conflict over resources, are still alive and longing to rebuild the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes of recent decades have grown sharply as Bolivia, after five years of deliberations, awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be issued on October 1.
"Bolivia is united in a spirit of unity and peace and of course hopes for positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the ICC's ruling on big screens in the hope that the Hague tribunal will pass a positive decision on Bolivia's complaint, with Chile being obliged to negotiate the country's access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president awaiting a controversial election race, is also interested in how Monday's decision will end.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific Ocean again," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts tend to believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia — even if it did, little would change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power over Chile and said it would not determine a possible outcome of the talks.
The fact that the ruling will only be issued six months after the last arguments were heard hardly indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the last four years could have pushed it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been illegally raised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that any remains of goodwill in Chile have been destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the conversation, but after all this it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's spokesman in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's verdict was handed down unusually quickly.
"Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity on Monday to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, and uses the issue of the sea as political manipulation.
"Bolivie will never renounce the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile ourselves with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to give up nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises as agreed by rival leaders at a summit in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to resume jammed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim in Singapore.
Ri says the “utopian dream” is that if sanctions continue and the U.S. abandons its declaration on the end of the Korean War, North Korea could someday be kneeling down.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes credible disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is not serious about abandoning an arsenal it seems to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to pave the way for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
The Paris Fashion Show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to complement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large headgear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and he just stunned the viewers of Paris Fashion Week with his style.
These extremely impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching pieces on the podium.
The outstanding work of Valentine was a huge body-colored hat decorated with a wide, feather-like edge that envelops the dummy’s head.
Other non-standard sized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn on the lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a diving suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other resembled a melted ice cream nozzle.
And if you follow this giant fashion trend, you won’t ask.
Style experts guess that these huge covers can get into the stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two-foot edges were already worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost the same size as the model wearing it in a swimsuit.
The red brick raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, became the exclusive highlight of Jacquemus' collection "La Riviera SS19" at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I think next summer huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores because the designer has had such a big impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for custom-sized accessories.”
John Edward: “Language is a vital skill for the world’s citizens”
Scottish Independent Schools broke their academic record in 2018 and once again demonstrated outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other community merits.
With a total of more than 30,000 students enrolled across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to be global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can design and implement the planned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and willingly chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you can talk to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of recent exams this year, we can say that languages are at the peak of popularity and have the best passing ratings in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the highest A rating.
The data collected from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent received the highest grade A in German, and 69 percent received the highest grade A in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign language skills as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an optional subject are now considered as important as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 percent of all reasons employers struggled to fill jobs were insufficient language skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
As future employability will depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses to pursue with a second language, he or she will be much better off in the future if he or she possesses these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person who learns several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the interview, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for the children of today.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in view of the future 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a teaching environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital for the country’s future, so this must be reflected in the education system as well.
In fact, modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and results to young people in Scotland.
This must be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will begin his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans have not yet seen LeBron James start the Los Angeles Lakers season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How long it will take is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason games with the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need a pre-season game to get ready,” he said.
Trump speaks in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign in Willing, West Virginia tonight.
It is the first of five planned Trump speeches next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to approve the suspension procedure for his chosen supreme court candidate, Trump is seeking to mobilise support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans were threatened to lose control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump’s speech in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s speech in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online in the YouTube broadcast below.
Trump is likely to touch on the topic of this week’s Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as she sowed a lot of tension over sexual misconduct allegations when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of the campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength ahead of the November elections.
President Trump’s campaign said the goal of the five meetings next week was to “energise volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the very hot campaign season begins," a Trump campaign spokesman said.
“The Wesbanco talk scheduled for this evening should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention in Pittsburgh,” West Virginia’s Metro News said.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is on the lowest rankings according to polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to put him on the top of the ratings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is belligerent and expects to enter Sunday unit competition
After three personal rounds Saturday afternoon, the quartet could be exactly what was needed in this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation in luck is absolutely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this.
Whose side is luck on now?
"They got six points first and now four, so I guess we can think of it as a little success," said Jordan Speth, who was preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the forefront, with a four-point lead and twelve matches ahead.
The American enthusiasm, according to Speth, faded, and they did not lack it, not to mention the shape of Speth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four points.
Speth was invincible from beginning to end and impeccably first.
As the round continued, those wild victorious screams became more and more famous. To finish the fourth match, Thomas scored two out of two possible points.
His strike, which won them in this match at pit 15, was accompanied by similar screams, which seemed to say that the American team was not at risk of ending.
"You just need to focus and take care of your matches," said Speth.
Now each of these players has to play separately.
Towards a successful end, 18 holes.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple not to need extra strikes not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
The course of events and the reaction of the spectators confirm that they will be the players who win Sunday, and no one else will be as popular as Fleetwood or Molinary, who, with the last rays of the sun set on the field of Le Golf National, have a chance of winning Europe.
It would be nice if both were successful at the same time.
It is too early to speak of European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern hero of four balls, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional blows in the first nine-hole series plunged the Spanish and Swedes into trouble, from which they never managed to escape.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they give and the tips they don’t give, and the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so it came to the final with a decisive lead, but this quartet stage also showed that the US team has the backbone of a fighter, which some, especially in the states, questioned.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10:6
Europe will compete on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a strong lead after Saturday’s quadruple league, with a score of 10-6 against the United States.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories against Tiger Woods and became the four-point leader of Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to save the trophy that they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning four against the unsuccessful American side and ended the stage by 3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the fours after winning two matches, but failed to score points.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points out of Sunday's 12-piece matches to keep the trophy in hand.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to score four consecutive points when he and Molinar dubbed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple to score four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they defeated the trustless Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a high level of professionalism at some point, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his four games, seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning fours and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fours, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the world rankings.
Even on a pleasant, gentle day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe wasn’t like butter.
Three-time winners Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas raised the bar for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In a four-ball match, they won 2-1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in a four-ball match they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 without hitting the ball in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to regain a four-point lead in single matches, although Furyko's side would have enough draws to keep the trophy.
Although two days were in second place, Sunday seemed to have turned away from them.
North Korea says it won’t disarm unilaterally
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were fuelling their distrust of the United States and that the country would not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri said North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we have not received a similar response from the U.S. side," he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s opposition to a staged approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea by taking steps, his statement stood out in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "the disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to relax tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is demanding nuclear disarmament first and is increasing pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by means of coercive methods, even by refusing to declare the end of the war,” he said.
“To think that sanctions can bring us to our knees is like people who don’t care about pursuing utopian dreams.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting, highlighted by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If the other country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
But the tone of Ri's speech has changed dramatically since last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile gentleman" on a suicide mission, targeting North Korea's missiles to the US was absolutely inevitable.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still a long way to go and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea meets nuclear disarmament requirements.
Trump said Wednesday he had no timetable, saying "if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should repay Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must be resolutely continued without any concessions until the full and definitive evidence-based nuclear disarmament is achieved.”
The Security Council has unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the backstage of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to loosen the ground for another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the trip has been a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying all the progress was only for North Korea to announce in a few hours that he had made "gangster claims."
North Korea said at a meeting with Moon this month it would dismantle the missile base and nuclear facility if the United States took "appropriate measures".
Kim said the “adequate measures” he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest Enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more to combat the growing macho culture in studies, caffeine intake and waking up at night.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often don’t even have the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist in women's hospitals in Brigham City, has prepared a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare this course came after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the talk, one girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in the last year of my studies?’
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleeping habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services department, said the university decided to offer the course after it turned out that students had a severe weekly sleep deprivation.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a photo of a dormitory room where students can click a cup of coffee, curtains, simulators, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects sports performance, and how important a sleeping routine is.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Student campus map with interactive icons that encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” Professor Czeisler explained.
The culture of pride in waking up at night, he said, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure have led students to the ever-growing problem of sleep deprivation.
“Ensuring that you get enough and quality sleep should be students’ secret weapon in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even avoiding weight gain because lack of sleep turns the brain into a fasting mode, so students are constantly feeling hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zeisler prepare the course when he attended one of the courses he taught last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to attend this course before attending this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alarm clock when to go to bed, just as they do when they wake up, and beware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lights, as they can blow your circadian rhythm out of balance, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers faced another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingstone beat Steven Gerrard's weakened score by 1:0.
Ibrox had hoped to win their first out-of-the-box victory after a four-to-one victory for St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games and now the team is eight points behind the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers couldn’t see any chance to equalize the score.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is in third and Hibernian is behind only one goal.
And the Rangers' worries don't end there, because it's likely that the butter from the stands hit side judge Calum Spencus in the head and injured him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to overtake Ayr and lead him to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted the same elephant who took the point off the Hearts last week, and would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations tied up opponents at every turn.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They were able to score as early as the second minute when Menga kicked allan McGregor's Scott Pittman, but the midfielder ruined his chance by pushing the ball away from the gate.
After Keaghan Jacobs's far-flung free-kick, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-defender Alan Lithgow pleaded aside.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was only hopeful, not believing in their game.
With 15 minutes to go, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson handed the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only hit twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly’s headshot or a gentle drift of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livi’s 34th minute goal may not match the course of the game, no one will argue that they deserved it just for their efforts.
The Rangers again failed to defeat Jacobs' viscous defense.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept the restraint and handed Menga over to an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that replacing almost immediately became fruitful when the national midfielder gambled against Morelos, but Kelly repelled the strike in a spectacular way.
Livingston engaged guests in a game they liked – with distant passing of the ball by Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team was able to increase their lead in the end, but McGregor defended himself from Jacobs' blow after Lithgow's filing from the corner.
Rangers Glenn Middleton once again appealed to the end of the game for a penalty after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago, and MORE... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that later led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a hit in the world of science and later in popular culture, with cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans playing cowboys in Bells of Coronado in 1950:
The man said, “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the atoms that are touched by the radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Hey, it's really shooting now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that received his name continues to exist.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to See Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to See Bad Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
The cells can then “see” the proteins that are found in many cancers, and then be injected back again.
The trial vaccine produced promising results in treating patients with various cancers.
In one woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory, so that the cells can see the proteins that are characteristic of HER2 type cancers, and then inject them back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are extracted from patients and trained to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West released the Trump supporting tirade, wearing a maga cap, after his appearance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
After an incoherent show, Saturday Night Live shouted at Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, saying he would be taking part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song, "Ghost Town," that night, wearing a cap with the inscription "Make America Great," he continued to denounce the Democrats and back Trump.
“How many times have I spoken to white people who said, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
“Well, if racism were a problem for me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a comic scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's footage to social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with this recording.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his headdress.
“They mocked me in the backstage.
He said he didn't go there with that hat.
They're making fun of me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I wear my superman cap and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love.”
His speeches at least twice provoked disapproval shouts in the audience, and members of the SNL broadcast seemed ashamed, according to Variety. One man told the media: "There was deadly silence throughout the studio."
West was called to urgently replace singer Ariana Grande after her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West bewildered many with his performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR THINGS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just himself and it’s amazing.”
“But I choose NOT to take a man (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’) whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's free.
But we are also free,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator to change his name, but followed the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyon; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Accused of Knife Attack at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder when he was wounded with a knife in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balihakamoro.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
'Game of Thrones' Star Keith Harrington Criticizes Perverted Approach to Masculine
Another Harrington became famous as sword-revolving character John Snow in HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of a macho hero. He argues that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they need to be cool to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought "something was wrong," and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of distorted masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Another, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague named Rose Leslie, said the subject "strongly touched him."
“I feel that I am very concerned about this topic now. Where did we make a mistake in cultivating masculinity?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he asked.
“What do we teach growing men that we are facing such problems?”
Another believes that partly because of this wave of distorted masculinity, television could be responsible because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they should have this kind of masculinity?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change that?
“We made a mistake with the young men somewhere.”
He also confirmed in an interview that he would not participate in any prehistory or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying "he's got enough battlefields and horses."
From November, the next film will be in the modern version of "True West" by Sam Shepard, a film about the film director and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him when he created "Game of Thrones," where he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this series, so in this sense, the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose starred Igrite, the love object of another character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Scottish property belonging to the Leslie family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
According to health authorities, the infection infected more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have transmitted the infection sexually, which is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
But over time, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to anti-HIV medicines as a way to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked senator data, denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
US spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied the allegations that one of her employees posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were filed by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and again despicable lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The disclosures reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday from an unknown man on Capitol Hill while the Senate was accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
The leaked information came a little later, when the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address from which the source of these records was determined has been associated with the Waters office and the information of the Waters employee member has been disclosed.”
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry," wrote Fleischer.
"It says she doesn't have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He should be calm and humble."
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who takes part in the midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's true, if not a lie," he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the organizers are made clear," she continued, "and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception."
"Johnny Inglish Strikes Again" Review – Expired Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for "Brexit" hints in any British film. The same seems to be true of the revival of the action spy comedy franchise "Johnny Inglish" - "Johnny Inglish" was launched in 2003 and returned to the screens with the comedy "Johnny Inglish Resurrection" in 2011.
Will this sarcastic autosatisfaction about how we obviously failed be a new national export opportunity?
Anyway, the incompetent Johnny English has a second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with his wide-eyed and rubberized face. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> After all, the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy piece is intended for non-English-speaking regions of the cinematographer.
Of course, this foolish secret agent, who, while claiming luxury, has also acquired some of the characteristics of Inspector Clouseau, some of Mr. Bean’s traits, and a bit of similarity to that guy, has been used to create the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also somewhat based on the character of the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten commercial Barclaycard TV.
There are a few beautiful moments in this new Johnny Inglish movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedian talent is obvious, but humor itself seems exhaled and strangely surplus, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible boldly insert elements of comedy.
Humor is more for children than for adults, and I don't think Johnny Inglish's insane adventures are as inventive and purposeful as Atkinson's quiet jokes of playing Mr. Bean.
The most common theme at the moment is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The hacker successfully invaded Britain’s secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the field, causing the agent’s outrage at Kevin Eldon’s too insignificant role.
It’s the last drop in the cup of the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who already suffers from crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May squeezes everything she can, but there’s little good material in the script for that.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among the retired.
That means I'm going to have to go to Johnny Inglish himself, who's now a school director in some luxurious institution, but who's giving illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were a few good jokes here when Inglish proposed a School of Rock-like spy academy.
The Englishman is sent back to Whithol to discuss the state of emergency and there he meets his longtime joint Bough, again starring Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays the role of a high society girl, seems to be under-exploited.
So Batman and Robin, capable of messing up everything in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko's fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova.
The prime minister has a dangerous twist from a charismatic billionaire who says he can solve Britain’s computer problem, a malicious Jason Volta starring Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their own odyssey: dressed as waiters, they set fire in a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxurious Volta yacht, and English begins complete anarchy in an attempt to use virtual reality headsets to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops were clearly preserved for this last series, but no matter how nice or wild it is, it all resembles a lot of children's television.
Quite average.
As with the other Johnny Inglish films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for Britain to work four days a week, but would pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow Britain to work four days a week but pay five days.
The party said it wants corporate executives to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring the same salary back home.
The source says the idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to steer the country’s development in a workforce-friendly direction.
The shift to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to promote the idea, as the Green Party promised during the four-day week of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not party policy and the party does not discuss it."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity to present his vision of a socialist economic revolution at last week’s Labour Party conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water shareholders may not recover their full share, as the Labour government may deduct something if it sees the wrong done.
He also approved plans to incorporate employees into the company’s board of directors and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees and allow them to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer 60 Minutes question on whether an ongoing FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could influence the opinion of any Republican senators so that they do not support the judge.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes interview, Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to be taking a more relaxed approach than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” said Kennedy.
"As I said when I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When that happened, when these accusations came out, I called him and asked, “Did you do that?”
He responded decisively, firmly, unambiguously.”
Nothing seems to change Graham’s opinion.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, we should have really shocking accusations," he said.
"For Dr. Ford, I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies that," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one what she says can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
The World Citizens’ Festival will take place on Saturday in New York, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars with the equally impressive goal of eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the World Citizens’ Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people not only listening to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also spreading the message about the event’s true goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens’ Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the Global Anti-Poverty Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert attendees had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or some other meaningful contribution to raising awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, are the citizens of the world succeeding in achieving this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really going to convince them to demand and call for action? Maybe this is just another example of what's called clickiness, fictitious activism: people think they'll really change things by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter.
According to World Citizens’ Festival organizers, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters that promote a wide range of goals.
Under pressure, they say world leaders have announced <0x24>37 billion in commitments and policies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and statements triggered by the group's actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion have been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide are already directly affected by the secured funds.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives that aims to “help children grow up and unleash their full potential”. With more than 4,700 tweets from the world’s citizens, she promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help address the country’s nutritional deficiencies.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments and people like you, citizens of the world, we can make social injustice such as malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of Nutrition Power, to a concert crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following 5,000 appeals to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the “Nutrition Power” project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
On our website, in response to one of the FAQs, which asks "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?",
Citizens of the world respond: “This is a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But just like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers who are taking part in this year's New York event. The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy could be used to block Russian energy exports
"When necessary, Washington can use the navy to block access to markets for Russian energy, as well as Middle East markets," Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke says Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when it is acting on the invitation of legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think Russia is intervening in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"The United States can do this through the navy, it can make the seas open and it can block them if necessary, it can make sure their energy doesn't get to the market," he said.
Zinke said this to those attending an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group called the U.S. "the voice of energy consumers."
He further compared Washington's methods with those used to address Russia and Iran, and noted that they were basically the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser counterweight to replace fuel," he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends entirely on fossil fuels.
The statements came as part of the Trump administration's mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia in the market, offering European consumers a much cheaper option.
That is why Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the allegedly improper Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion-euro Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said Washington's fierce opposition to the project was purely economic and was an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.’s stance received a hostile response from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The German Industry Federation (BDI) has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly oppose third-state interference in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at Hollook Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, and they have to go to the supreme position," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether or not to take part in the presidential election."
During a meeting at the town hall, Warren rebuked President Donald Trump, saying he was driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very frightened of how Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticises Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "There is a clear need for an investigation by the FBI before the vote."
But a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters believe she shouldn't run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Centre for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts say a senator shouldn’t take part in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour and 48 percent against.
Other names discussed for a possible 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to Associated Press.
At Donald Trump's meeting, Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
Track Palin, 26, who took up military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“I see what my son is going through, what he is facing when he comes back to his daily routine, so I understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder, and some of the wounds our soldiers are getting back with,” she told a gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an avoidable truth, saying that the son and other veterans of war "are returning a little bit changed, they are returning a harder heart, they are returning doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as preventing reports of domestic gun violence and drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wassila police department.
18 States and District of Columbia Support Resistance to New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the county submitted comments to amicus curiae (a court consultant) in Washington to support a challenge to asylum seekers' policies.
The full name of the applicant in the proceedings Grace v. Sessions initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy is not disclosed.
She says her partner “and members of his criminal gang” abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers in the Graz-backed states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many asylum applications as states afflicted by the problems of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be made on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said amicus curiae.
In the remark, lawyers also argue that the policy of denying immigrants entry is damaging the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “provide the jobs they need.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political affiliation," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Due to the double death toll in Palu, survivors are desperately sought.
The situation of the remaining survivors continues to deteriorate.
"Tension is very high," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she calms her febrile son at Palu's devastated evacuation center.
“The ambulance continues to carry more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
It has been observed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect water-filled items, and try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the 7.5-magnitude earthquake hospitals were crowded.
Some of the wounded, like Dwi Harry, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were placed outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside in the wake of severe repeated strikes.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells how he felt a violent earthquake in the hotel's fifth-floor room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save others.
I think I broke through the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited an addendum paid by the China Daily to the state's top-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of trying to influence the November 6 U.S. congress election, which China denied.
"Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common practice for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a growing trade war and both countries are fighting tariffs on each other's imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, China's retaliatory tariffs were targeted at Iowa and similar exporters who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China, former longtime governor of Iowa and one of the biggest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China was "even more mocked by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used American-respected freedom of speech and press by ordering a paid advertising message to the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"At the same time, you will not find contradictory voices in the local Beijing press kiosk, and you will not get a real picture of the differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the hard feet of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Branstad also added that "one of China's most well-known newspapers has evaded an offer to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Kavanaugh's fiasco was deterred by Republican voters ahead of mid-elections
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with several sexual harassment charges, analysts warned it would face a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion is very strong and many Republicans have already officially said they want to take part in the vote.
Such things can't be taken back later," Grant Reeher, a professor at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted last-minute calls by Senator Jeff Flake to open an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it both tomorrow and November," Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted, "November is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Kzip reported to Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overwhelming,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
People say she's already strong, and they're right.
But it could strengthen its position, especially among undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who, although they don’t like the president, often simply don’t vote.”
Even before Ford gave public testimony, when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment of the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans approved the candidacy, it could be outrageous.
"This has caused great confusion for the Republican Party," former Chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, it's not just about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, it's about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated Ford," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats in the elections.
However, it seems that the Americans are still divided over what to believe after Kavanaugh and Ford's testimony, even though she has a little more support.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents totally or probably believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say totally or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh was either true or likely to have lied while giving testimony, and only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
At Flake's request, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges and the testimony of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford gave testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh had attacked her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
Web Inventor Plans to Establish New Internet to Resist Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is developing a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt’s latest project is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was to take over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment."
“Solid” technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store – POD.
It can include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
As if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in the same browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who can access which information and which ones.
The company calls this the empowerment of a person through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes, and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can develop their own decentralized apps using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not in talks with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a statement released on Saturday, Berners-Lee said Inrupt’s “mission is to provide trading energy and an ecosystem to protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel a lot of optimism about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Bath was awarded the Victorian Cross in World War I
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only Anglican clergyman who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard was awarded the Bath Award on September 29, 1918 during the Belenglish and Lucour offensives.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military award.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren uncovered a memorial stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Bath, said it was "marvelously symbolic" that the stone was unveiled 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the Saint-Kent's Canal "in the midst of very thick fog, severely blowing fire with guns and rifles."
He then rushed to the shooting line and "extremely gallantly" led the line forward, and then attacked the gun and killed three of the squad's fighters by himself.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Bath, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that will never be matched by himself, but at the same time, a very inspiring act of humility."
After the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Micheal and his brother Dr. James Bath laid the wreath.
Micheal Bath said it was an honor for him to attend the parade, adding: "The bravery of a true hero is shown by the support that so many people will provide."
MMA fans didn’t go to bed all night to see the Bellator 206 but had to be content with the Piglet Pepa.
Imagine, you don’t go to bed all night to see a crowded Bellator 206, but you don’t get to see the main spectacle.
There were 13 fights on the San Jose show, including six on the main card, which were broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, British viewers were stunned by the interruption of the broadcast of the movie "Pigtail Pepa".
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was precisely because of this fight that they did not go to sleep until morning.
On Twitter, one of the fans called the replacement of the broadcast a children's cartoon "some kind of morbid joke."
“According to government regulations, such content is inappropriate at six o’clock in the morning, so the children’s program had to be turned on,” Dave Schwartz, chief vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, "Pig Peppy."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust schedules according to the viewers in the UK.
"When I think about repeating, I think we could probably do it," Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to resolve it until Sunday, our time, on Monday, their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, with the change of the broadcast, a lot of messages were exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
No, it is not a matter of power.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to fans, but we just failed.
This is an unsuccessful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling Impaired About His Sexual Orientation
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24th athlete said he only realized in primary school that he wasn’t the same as everyone else.
For the first time on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show, Desert Island Discs, he said he had started talking publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a father, it was not so important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the longtime host of the show, has quit her job for several months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, where guests are asked to imagine traveling to a desert island, Daley said he felt inferior to everyone else as he grew up because it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls alike.
He said: “Until now, this feeling of timidity and differentness has been the stimulus that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself worthy of something so as not to disappoint others when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals became a high-profile LGBT activist and took the opportunity to take part in this year’s Commonwealth Games to urge more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he started talking about it publicly because he thought he was lucky to be able to live an open life without any consequences, and he wanted to give the same hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but said the age gap was never a problem.
Delay said that when you experience so much at such a young age -- he took part in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- it was hard to meet someone of the same age but with the same heights and lows.
When the couple became parents to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Daley's outlook changed, he said.
“If you had listened to me last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is the same as that of his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto T. Daley's father was reluctant to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row," Daley said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable," Daley said.
A year later, he competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life -- jumping in the water with local spectators watching the Olympics -- there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song for the show, Heather Small's "Proud", which responded to his feelings in the run-up to the Olympics and still pleasantly scares his skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15am British Summer Time.
Mickelson missed the Ryder Cup on a bench on Saturday
Phil Mickelson is set to break a record on Sunday after taking part in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but he will need to improve his shape to avoid being an unsuccessful anniversary.
Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time in a biennial competition, was seated on a bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's quadruple race.
Rather than being in the action center, as was the case in the United States, the five-time main winner spent part of the day on the support team, and the rest refined his technique on the pitch to correct the bugs that prevented him from playing.
Even without a straight line at the top of his career, the 48 athlete is not the ideal player in the tight Le Gold National, which has a long stretch of rough grass that is particularly unfavorable to inaccurate strikes.
In addition, as if the pitch itself wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will be playing in the ninth game on Sunday against top British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the four-point Americans get a good start in the upcoming 12-piece matches, Mickelson’s match could be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he couldn’t speak otherwise.
“He understood the role he played today, gave me a back applause and said with a hug and a hand he was ready to play even tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He lacks self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I couldn’t have imagined that he would play two matches.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record as the Ryder Cup’s most-played athlete.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never reached his personal record highs.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s cheerful, sarcastic, witty, he likes to laugh at people, and he’s a great guy to have fun with in the team room,” he said.
I think the younger players have had a lot of fun this week, too.
It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large majority can quickly disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead in the run-up to the final Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough fight.
He made his debut in 1997 at Valdemara, where Captain Seve Ballesteros led the opposing team with a five-point lead over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line as soon as he scored 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We are constantly reminding ourselves that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderrama, where we won, but barely," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 show win on Friday 5:3 and 10:6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will tell me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow it will take all its strength.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – and we need to pursue it consistently.
“I’ve always said I’m counting on the 12 players on our side, but we know who’s on the other side, the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the difficult pitch, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to pre-empt myself in any way.
Tomorrow will be a completely different day.
Tomorrow’s the most important day will be an individual game – it’s different.
It’s great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, the limits of your ability to play golf are tested.
Tomorrow, players will have to squeeze everything out of themselves.
Now you have to break up with your partner, and he’ll have to squeeze everything out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the last day’s surprises because Brooklyn was on a winning team until Europe performed the miracle of Medina and made them losers.”
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players in 1999 to prepare for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but look for a quick start, like you’ve seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle matches become very tense.
We have formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that for us, you know, we're trying to create some sort of magic tomorrow."
Thomas will be tasked with trying to fight back against Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, while Europeans are led by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I chose these guys in this order because I think they will be able to complete the game successfully," Bjorn said.
Delivery of new German warship postponed
The latest frigate in the German Navy was supposed to be operational in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but local media say it will not be seen until at least next year because of perishable systems and a sharp rise in prices.
According to a military spokesman quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper, the commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main frigate ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project has been overshadowed by the problems that have plagued the ship that has already been delivered.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are believed to be equipped with powerful guns, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain sensitive technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frigates to sail far from home harbours for up to two years.
However, according to the Die Zeit, due to endless delays, state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete before they become operational.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press cites some major software and hardware defects that would have made the ship useless on a military mission.
The software shortcomings are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, the vessel proved to be far too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the naval fleet to introduce various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – alongside perishable technical equipment including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion).
The problems of the latest frigate have become particularly acute following recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the navy was in fact "looking for a shortage of usable ships".
The officer said that over time the problems had come together because the old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at a Scottish highland estate, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will be watching dwarf chicks, soprano chicks, brown ears, and aquatic owls in Wester Ross Inverev's gardens.
Special recorders will be placed in certain parts of the territory to track bat activity throughout the season.
National health service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all audio recordings will determine the frequency of the signals emitted by bats and the activity of one or another type.
Then a map of habitats will be created and a report will help to form a detailed picture of behavior on the scale of the whole landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat maintenance work such as grassland creation, as well as how best to maintain forested areas so that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works affecting hatcheries and destroying residential habitats.
There are also threats from wind turbines and lightning, as do western cats, some chemicals used to treat building materials, and domestic hunting cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But to catch prey during night hunting is more helpful ears than eyes.
Bats accurately locate insects or obstacles in the flight path using sophisticated echolocation.
The NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes a particularly responsible look at bats.
There are ten trained experts working there who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of hatcheries and sometimes rescue operations .
The organization even created the first and only reserve in Scotland specifically dedicated to bats in Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bats live.
Manor manager David Thompson says that the manor territory is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats in Threave manor,” he said.
- We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas for living.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is crucial to check for bats before starting maintenance work on the site, as accidental destruction of one hatchery could kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill, tease or disturb them, as well as to destroy their hatcheries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Protection Fund, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of the bats.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many indigenous species are doing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape: lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “little” and said people were using his name “to make themselves known.”
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The frontman of Portugal and Juventus clubs is accused of raping American girl Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that he then paid the alleged woman <0x24>375,000 to keep the event silent.
Speaking to 142 million followers on a live Instagram video hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports as “liars.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today, a lie, said the five-time Ballon d’Or laureate, staring at the camera.
They want to use my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name – that’s part of my job.
"I'm a happy person, I'm okay," the athlete added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel on charges they have described as "unacceptable publicizing suspicions of private affairs."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damage of an amount commensurate with the seriousness of this violation, perhaps one of the most serious personal violations of law in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at Palms Casino and Hotel Apartment in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Nevada’s Clark County Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete’s room after a meeting at a nightclub where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99 percent good man" betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
Ronaldo admitted that the couple had sex, but said it was contractual.
Mayorga also said she turned to police and her injuries were photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid before joining Italian giant Juventus with a 100-million-euro deal this summer.
Brexit: UK would forever regret losing car manufacturers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its global automotive leadership status after Brexit.
He added that he was worried about a statement by Toyota’s UK branch to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily suspended at Burnaston’s factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said a delay at the border after a no-deal Brexit would mean job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production," said Toyota CEO Burnastone Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about a no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on international trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The car makers are most concerned about the threats to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line works when it’s needed, because for custom-made cars, parts come from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry said could lead to delays in delivery or lack of parts.
Toyota said it would not be able to store more than one day's supplies at the Derbyshire plant and would stop production.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such border checks."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, not only allows us to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC's Radio 4 program Today.
“In addition to Toyota, data from other car manufacturers show that we need to continue to have access to a very successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has worked for 24 years at Burnaston and is responsible for Unite trade union meetings, said his union members were increasingly worried: "I say from experience that once these jobs are lost, they will never return."
The government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed
"As the battle for the Supreme Court nominee continues, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week," the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, Trump’s assistants’ ties with Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller’s independence, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a microphone for recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th Amendment to oust the president.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, with his resignation sparkling, he went to the White House on Monday.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, which witnessed both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, again postponing the vote in the Senate.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “His date is not set. It may take place this week, but in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report to the press."
Some journalists would disagree: since September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that press conferences are rarely held because they don't like TV journalists looking for effects for viewers. True, he added, "I have to agree with the fact that they are looking for effects for viewers."
He then suggested that Trump would be in direct contact with the press more often.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, adding, without providing any evidence, "we have reviewed these statistics."
Sanders said press conferences would be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to put questions directly to the President of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We have tried it many times, and you have seen it many times in the last few weeks, and the press conferences will be replaced by your direct contact with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes weird appearance of the president before journalists this week in New York must have explained why.
Scottish Health Minister Writes to EU NST Workers About Brexit Concerns
The Scottish health minister wrote a letter to EU workers at the NST expressing the country's gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent residence status for EU nationals working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
In a letter, Freeman said: "In the summer, the UK-EU talks on withdrawal continued and are approaching the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has accelerated preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know you are all very worried now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation of the contribution of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring with them valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the performance of the healthcare system and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Vanderbilt Commodores lost 31:27 on Saturday to Tennessee State Tigers defender Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation, Tennessean journalist Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medics at the sideline gave Abercrombie a breath of oxygen, then laid it on a stretcher and sent it for further research.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, told the WSMV that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that "no information is yet available on the type and extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, who is officially in second year, has moved from Illinois and is playing for Tennessee State for the first season.
Before leaving the game, he rebounded five balls on Saturday, and the total number of rebounds during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers of real estate in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty
Under new Tory plans, foreign buyers of real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on non-taxpayers in the UK
The finance ministry hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of real estate in the UK will be charged a higher stamp duty and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
Promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners, this move is expected to reduce the risk of a successful campaign by Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on non-taxpayers and businesses in the UK, while the extra money will be used to boost the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge – paid in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes or houses for rent – can reach as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built property is bought by non-UK residents, which makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to buy.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many of the wealthy districts of the country, and especially the capital, have become ghost cities.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower stamp duty to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by quickly buying land but not using it, and urged May to address Britain’s housing shame by abandoning affordable housing quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching housing reforms, including controlling rents and banning faultless removals.
In addition, he wants to give more power to build new houses to municipal councils.
May said: “Last year, I said that as prime minister, I would try to return to the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
This means that we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents and companies established abroad can buy homes as easily as hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost impossible, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's national team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become the head of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotsman likes the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is now third in the first league and three points behind the club.
After St Mirren's return to the Scottish Championships last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I'm in B and it's over," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
“But as a child, I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my dad watching many Scottish national team matches, and that always attracted me to come back.
This will only happen if I manage the club well.”
Before Ross, Sunderland was led by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers, the former Alloa Athletic CEO said he was not worried about starting to work after such famous executives in such a big club.
“Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
By its structure and terms, this club is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but it's probably only after I get back to the league that I think I've been successful here."
Ross's managerial career lasted only three years, before which he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and replaced the Hearts coaches for 15 months.
Later, he helped the Alloa recover from the third division, and the St Mirren club, which was threatened to fall, became the champions of the next season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he has ever felt during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This change must have been radical," he recalls about the leadership of Alloa.
“I really believed that it was better for me to lead than to play.
It sounds weird, because I was lucky, earned a lot and enjoyed satisfactory achievements.
Playing can be difficult.
You have to deal with a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – working stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and as an adult I always felt like I was on my sled, but leadership is the most satisfying thing."

Studies have shown that the best time for a pint of beer is Saturday at 5.30 pm.
The summer heatwave has boosted the incomes of poor breweries in Britain, but has made it even more burdensome for restaurant chains.
The figures revealed that sales of brewery and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of CGA, a business consultancy that compiled the data, said: “The endless sunshine and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup meant that the same trend continued in July as in June, when brewery revenues rose by 2.8 percent. True, restaurants suffered even more than before.
In June, sales in restaurants dropped by 1.8 per cent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The results of breweries and bars, which receive the main income from the sale of beverages, were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew more strongly than it decreased in restaurants.
Although not as hard as restaurants, pubs that receive the main income from food sales were also hit in the sun.
People seem to just want to go out for a drink.
In well-managed pubs and pubs, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman of RSM, an analysis firm in the leisure and hospitality sector, said: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
As far as catering establishments are concerned, the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain key factors.
It is not surprising, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle. It is true that for a number of years, the drop in sales of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the persistent cost-related pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the most earning companies from the food trade. Time will tell whether the milder August temperatures will provide the necessary rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of branded networks.
In the UK, The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for the brewery, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes activity data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some just 11 years old, have social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing.
The news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a parent account to show their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that fake Instagram pages are growing rapidly, a link to Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they used a censored parent account to show their parents, but they also had secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of a thirteen-year-old daughter found out that the teenager insisted, "Strike me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (CDK) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, with half of those students admitting to hiding accounts.
MDK chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the Scottish Sports Council, Eilidha Doyle was elected as its consultant director.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and chairwoman. Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the wide range of international experience she has gained over the past decade.
"Eilidha has earned great respect from the entire Scottish, UK and global sports community, and we have no doubt that her inclusion in the council will be of great benefit to Scottish sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to serve as an athlete’s voice and I hope I’ll really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, the American now appearing as a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a short-term ischaemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was necessary to work until exhaustion, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do exercises for agility!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows has received different evaluations online
The company that produces breast pumps has received different opinions about its advertising, which compares breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of a product described as the world’s first silent portable breast lifting, consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new breast pump gives nursing mothers.
In the hay-filled cowhouse, four real mothers dance according to a sound recording, in which the following words can be heard, for example: "Yes, I am lying to myself, but no tail can be seen" and "If you haven't noticed, this is not the udder, this is my breast."
“Take him out, take him out, I feed him to babies, I draw him out, I lick him to my beautiful ones.”
However, an advertisement on the company’s Facebook page sparked an online dispute.
The video, which was viewed 77 000 times and received several hundred comments, was seen in different ways by viewers, many of whom said that it overlooked the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, only to be taken away from their newborns a few days after giving birth.”

Another commented: “It is understandable that this traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers whose babies aren't taken away?"
He added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the advertisement - one woman admitted that the song was "very fun" for her.
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I were still eating.
When I was breastfeeding, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertisement is for moms who get their milk off (often at the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they all danced with unnoticed breast pumps in their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many breast milkers say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s breast pump does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes, and sits seamlessly in the feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold babies or even leave the house when they pull out of their milk.
Anna Balarin, Mother’s partner and executive creative director, commented: “Elvie’s milk extractor is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
When comparing breastfeeding women to dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk cessation and all the challenges it poses, while at the same time showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk extraction will bring you with the most fun and as much as possible.
It wasn’t the first time Elvie’s milk pump was in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, Marta Jakubowski’s collection was shown on the podium by the mother of two children using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp near Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has remained largely unchanged over the month, but the number of migrant children apprehended has risen significantly, partly because the Trump administration’s strict rhetoric and policy has made it harder to accommodate them with carers.
Traditionally, the majority of carers themselves were immigrants without documents and feared that when applying for child custody they risked staying in the country.
The announcement by the federal government in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and share the data with immigration authorities increased the risk.
Last week, Matthew Albence, Chief Immigration and Customs Officer, testified to Congress that the institution had detained dozens of people who had applied for the custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not previously been tried.
"Almost 80 percent of these people - guardians or their families - live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these individuals,” said Albence.
According to the employees of the shelter, in order to consider the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention, and not within 60 days, as was usual before.
Many will try to defend their request for legal status against a judge on immigration issues not by coming in person, but by videoconferencing.
Those who have been declared ineligible for assistance will be expelled quickly.
According to the shelter’s staff and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer the children stay detained, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to abuse or attempts to escape.
Defenders say this is even more alarming in large establishments such as Tornillo Shelter, where size increases the chance of missing signs of a child suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends could worsen the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home after eight years of war.
Moualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces under the pretext of counter-terrorism were illegal on Syrian soil and would be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terrorism in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have fled their homes since 2011, was almost over.
He said Damascus would not stop fighting this holy battle until we eradicate both terrorist groups and any illegally staying foreigners from all parts of Syria.
There are some 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that discourage refugees from returning.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive reconstruction aid only when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has paved the way for faster political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee – the group’s work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.

In a tense midterm election to the House of Representatives, money is pouring around
Not surprisingly, the reshuffle of congress districts, which resulted in two House members trying to win the same seat, led to a flood of money in Pennsylvania’s 17th district.
The recently re-drawn suburb of Pittsburgh has drawn Democrat Conor Lamb into the fight, winning his seat in a special election in another constituency last spring.
Lamb is competing with Keith Rothfuss, a Republican member of the House who currently represents Pennsylvania's previous 12th district, a large part of which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been tampered with in favor of Republicans in violation of the constitution.
In the new 17th constituency, major party financial institutions -- the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCPC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) -- clashed over campaign finances.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania when he won the March special elections in the 18th congressional district by a slight majority.
For more than a decade, Republicans occupied the place, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Politicians gave the Democrats some advantage.
U.S. Punishes El Salvador for Supporting China, But Shuts Down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have generally not received a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country before the partners moved away from the leadership of the Trump Organization.
"As a result of recent decisions to withdraw recognition, Taiwan State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
Sanctions are only being considered against El Salvador, which received <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions on individuals, would have been painful for the high unemployment and murder rate in Central America.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity after a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an important step forward in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending any reflection on sanctions against El Salvador.
"To demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the speaker list for the conference scheduled for mid-October," diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, not reporting any reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the discussion, which three American officials, including two diplomats, told Bolton, and agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity was preserved.
Learn History
Further, it is inevitably awaiting a report by special adviser Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, with very strong evidence now available in public archives.
In addition, Mueller is allegedly investigating whether the Trump campaign was conducted in secret in cooperation with Russia, which undermined our elections.
If Congress were to fall into other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time as he prepares to appear again before the voters and perhaps finally before the officials’ commission.
There’s a lot of “if” here, and I don’t argue that Trump’s end is inevitable – just like its counterparts in Europe.
We will all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and those choices will determine whether the battle will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler – it was only necessary for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent the subsequent slaughter, which lasted several years.
History moves around such crucial turning points that the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Now the Americans are at a number of such crucial turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein’s troubles began when the newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and considered his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or unfair, or if, despite convincing allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will make Trump take responsibility?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep it.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once lived in the house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later I was sent to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look at our future with a non-optimistic attitude?"

Graham Dorrans expects the Rangers to clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they win a spectacular match against the Austrians in Spain earlier this month, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
Because of his knee injury, Graham Dorrans was only able to show up for the first time this season in a 2:2 match against Villarreal, but he hopes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for more important goals.
"For us, this was a good result, because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended up doing something.
Maybe we could have been better at the end, but the game wasn’t bad at all.
They probably played better in the first half, and we got better in the second half, and we showed who we were as a better team.
On Thursday, there will be another major league event.
I hope that we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the recent competitions their result was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
“Last year was really hard – both what happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really excited; the training is great.
I hope we can move forward, forget last season and play well.”
This fear of pension savings causes women to suffer from insomnia
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the care they would like to receive, few talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they spoke with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance.
Here's where you need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children, and if you don’t tell them in advance, your family won’t be prepared to take care of you.
Discuss with your advisor and family where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors can be important to predict costs.
Call a financial advisor. The advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for these expenses.
For long-term care, you can choose to cover these costs with a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-insured life insurance policy, or by insuring your assets as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes with documents that allow you to protect yourself.
Prepare a mandate for healthcare. Appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that specialists will respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you become insolvent.

Man shot several times with pneumatic gun in Ilfrakum
After spending the night in the city, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The 40-year-old victim was shot to the chest, stomach and arm in the Ilfrakum Oxford Grave District, Devon.
The shooting was described as an accidental act by officials around 02:30 in England's summer time.
The victim did not see the attacker.
There is no threat to his life and the police are asking for witnesses to help.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
"At least 384 people died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," officials said.
Due to the destruction of communications, emergency services officials were unable to retrieve any data from Dongala regency, an area north of Palu, close to the magnitude 7.5 epicenter of the quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on Sulawesi Island.
With a population of some 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, founded at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the quake and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency stretching along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, the population of Regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, was about 299,200.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although mostly concentrated on the other side of Sulawesi, on the coast of Morovali.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Dongal, killing nine people.
Indonesia’s seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire is constantly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a violent quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several violent quakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 quake struck the southernmost part of Indonesia's most densely populated island of Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 quake struck an area near Padang, the western capital of Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of the islands of Mentawaii near Sumatra in 2010 and triggered a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres, sweeping dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
A slight earthquake in Aceh in 2016 devastated the reggae of Pidia Jaya and caused panic as people remembered how it was devastated after the terrible 2004 quake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes struck the Indonesian tourist-driven island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A report released on Saturday by Alaska police said Palin, 29, from Wassilah, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to detention.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took her phone away.
According to KTUU, Palin was returned to Mat-Su pre-trial detention and released on bail of <0x24>500.
"He appeared on Saturday in court, where, when asked for an excuse, he claimed to be totally innocent," the network said.
Palin is charged with three A-class offences, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a B-class offence, punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been indicted.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged assault.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence of alcohol.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son’s brutality to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the tsunami that struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos are being shared that show the tsunami moment.
The tsunami struck the coast as hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for New York terrorist suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Thirty-year-old Saipov is suspected of renting a truck from the Home Depot on October 31 and carrying out an attack on a bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a statement in the southern district of New York about its intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of the indictments could lead to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, covering eight charges of murder involving extortion (usually applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases) and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov carried it out has been described as disgusting, cruel and immoral.
“As a result of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov, members of the following families and friends were injured, injured and lost to their loved ones: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Dejon.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case that demanded the death penalty was in New York's South District a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two drug suppliers in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a New York federal case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted two years ago of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov of Uzbekistan origin did not regret his actions, either immediately after the attack or several months later.
Police said he told investigators he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by Islamic State videos he watched on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital room.
He has not pleaded guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal-funded advocates, said they were clearly disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than pleading guilty and serving life imprisonment without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGELAS FARAGE must be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of eurosceptics, and a member of the Theresa May party suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left now if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite her divided supporters have been revealed by the pro-EU Torys, who have joined the city's stand-alone anti-Brexit protest.
The prime minister finds it difficult to implement her Chequers-agreed compromise plan when she is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostile reactions and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" rally in Solihale that he wanted to disrupt Chekers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left the EU already," he said.
Wellingboro MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chekers' plan."
As he expressed his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to obey others.
We want to have our own laws in our country.”
Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “Believing that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is totally untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also took part in the demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among the members of our party and activists who take to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a critical statement, May added: “Prime Ministers retain their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians in the rally must feel the heat if they issue a 2016 referendum decision.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the nation and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilising the army of this nation that has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
And Brexit opponents marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rallies in the city centre.
When the group formed this weekend, a group of activists waved banners “Tories against Brexit”.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they had with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"They are people who say they can put in place the IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, for frictionless borders and for free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take part in presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election after the November elections.
The Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has repeatedly criticised President Donald Trump, is taking part in November’s re-election to compete with GOP state spokesman Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was guessed that it could run against Trump in 2020.
Ever since Trump became president, her Saturday afternoon event in Holjok has been her 36th meeting with voters using a public meeting format.
One of the participants asked if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair a broken government, and the woman should lead it.
Suspect arrested in LSU Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday they had arrested a suspect charged with shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the Southern University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of his injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be on the scene, had a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
When Simpson was arrested, he did not resist and was arrested by the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in the top five, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, scored 5.6 points and rebounded 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets close to world championship when his team ordered him to give victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott defeated Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it became immediately clear that Mercedes's orders would be crucial in the race.
Bott started the race from first place and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to walk into the two-wall garage, left Hamilton, and returned to the race in the tail of a group, so it was fatal.
Mercedes went into the two-barrier garage after the lap and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton took a step forward after almost contactless action, when the Ferrari driver reluctantly freed the inside of the track after a double manoeuvre to maintain his position in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the end of the round, but was seventh at the end of the first round.
He was the fastest for most of the race as he drove without changing tires in order to be as fast as possible in the finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
At the end of the 44th round, he reached the two-barrier garage, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in fourth place.
“Valtter had a difficult day because he was doing well all weekend and when asked to leave me, he behaved like a gentleman.
"The team did a great job and won the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting Saturday for denying she had leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly cite Ford’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were wicked, obscene and unjust.
"What could have happened, and indeed is happening in the Senate in recent days, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, wicked, obscene and unjust," he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Certainly not.
I haven't leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked... no, we did not leak," he added, depicting the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh, which was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: "I did not hide the accusations against Dr. Ford and I did not leak her history."
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
But, apparently, the president disagreed with her denial, and he said at a meeting with people on Saturday night: "You know, it was really bad body language.
"Maybe she didn't leak, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats used the accusations to their advantage.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the vileness, the obscenity; they don't care who they hurt or who they have to cross to gain power and control," the president quoted Mediaite as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Dundee Giants
Dundee Stars recovered their defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday and won Dundee's rebound game on Saturday by 5:3.
The Giants took off early when two goals were scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had punched the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back forward.
Francois Bouchard of Dundi matched the score, but later two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third defeat in the Elite League this season, after catching up in Belfast on Friday night and defeating Dundi by 2:1.
It was the fourth game this season and the previous three games were won by the Giants.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull's pass, and four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the lead after David Rutherford's pass.
In a difficult match, Sullivan brought the owners back to the game with a goal of 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's pass Cownie scored 15:16.
Dwyer arranged for the Giants to take their first break with a lead and scored their second goal at the end of the first half.
With a quantitative lead, the squad's hosts regrouped and Bouchard leveled the score again by 27-37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen get ahead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half, consolidating the victory by scoring a fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to help hundreds of passengers escape from earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died helping a plane with several hundred passengers take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing since Friday's tsunami-stricken earthquake hit Sulawesi island.
The area continues to be shaken by strong repeated earthquakes and many people trapped in the ruins of Palu.
While colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily fluctuating control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport.
He stayed at his workplace to help the Batik Air, which was on Flight 6321 and was already on the runway at the time, take off safely.
Then, believing that the control tower was falling, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We took him by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is a very painful news for us," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the country's disaster relief agency says the cities of Dangala, Sighi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The number of casualties is expected to increase as many casualties are still beneath the rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters in height have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances bring victims.
Lack of clean water.
Shops are being robbed everywhere."
Janis Gelfand, the head of the international Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
It’s a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Jok Widod arrived in Palu on Sunday, addressing the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Micronesian Pacific lagoon, now says one person is missing, although it had previously said all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the drowning plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they had no information on a passenger man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuko Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and were in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low ground.
"It was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others on the drowning and waist-flooded plane had managed to wake up to emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and shouted, while he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said its sailors repairing a nearby marina also helped rescue people who were being taken ashore by an inflatable boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the aviation safety network, 111 people have died in crashes with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst sets out the sequence of events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office set out the facts in a Saturday retrial on the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a forensic expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to bring together the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinto Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, contrary to previous statements.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers while he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lies because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another coincidence was that Telly claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Cell phone records show that they have known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tell had deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He has erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The Hip-Hop trio wants to change the negative attitude to this genre by spreading positive messages with their music.
The High Breed of Bristol says the hip-hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and has drawn attention to social issues.
They want to go back to the origins of hip hop and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have recently been reborn in the UK by performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York babysitter sues couple after being fired for 'racist' message
The New York nanny sued the couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a message from a mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied being racists and called the lawsuit "violence".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was dismayed to learn that Giselle Maurice, a new babysitter, was black when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"NEEEEE, ONE BLACK AGAIN," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, she was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman’s indiscretion made herself uncomfortable and fired Maurice, saying the former African-American nanny had done her job badly and hoped to see a Filipina instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for their dismissal and seeks to claim <0x24>350 a day for half a year's living and working at the client's home, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism, denying it and saying it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared they couldn’t trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to tell her.
She is not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasc told Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
My newborn?
I don't think."
Associating the lawsuit with "rape," Plasz said she had a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to judge for that?
It's not a very nice behavior," added the investment banking specialist.
While the case is under trial, the media hastened to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington's Publishers Feared Readers Wouldn't Understand A Speaking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel like someone else’s reading the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it is very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a children's book about a plush teddy bear, wouldn't have been too upset if his work had been rejected, and adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release, a year after his father's death, was both pleasant and sad.
Speaking about Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of the family," she added that his father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty calm person and didn't like to boast," she said.
“Because Paddington was so much like him, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success story in the same way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always devoted his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors have never been able to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and saying that the condition was really bad and she was not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received a call from Nad who called to tell her that she had two minutes left to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given by doctors to support her heartbeat slowly stopped working and was eliminated from her body.
She died a little earlier and that was the end of everything.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her deceased daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not realise the tough test she had to face.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and my tears broke all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a lot of pity for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women's mourning cards aim to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distribute postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and call for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in the aerodrome, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated the room.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “in a truly dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother who had committed suicide.
Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid that a chain reaction might happen.”
Mr. Davis created the postcards “so that people know that there are people around you who can be contacted and talked to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to speak.”
Humphreys, a longtime friend of Davies, has lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who retired shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed, and he didn't complain about anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
"On Christmas, the situation was absolutely bad: when the children rolled out their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes and didn't react."
She said his death was a tremendous trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It left a void in the family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all have to go further and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake.
I thought if we could actually get what he asked for -- a limited time and scope for the investigation -- perhaps we could bring some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "be in the grip" of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined solely by time.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections on November 6 and if Republicans are expected to perform poorly, their efforts to elect the person they want to take to the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, Bush’s former private secretary.
What will happen when the FBI issues its report?
The Senate now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh could get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of deserters ‘decreased’ after Kim came to power
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had fallen after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing South Korea's unification ministry, said 1,127 deserters were identified last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tightening border controls between North Korea and China and rising human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks that had stalled talks on nuclear denuclearisation.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they essentially agreed to work towards a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not having changed its sanctions since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to trust in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman did this, she would be said to be hysterical," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying or crying out, when he was talking about his family and high school.
He also denounced the accusations against the former Democrats in the committee, describing them as a “grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation” by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his bias towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and his attack on the Clintons and the Democratic Party," she said.
Asked whether he would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy was approved and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“If he lies to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is working for,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Affordable Healthcare Act or Roe v. Wade case because he was seen as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether to revoke certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased personality to become a judge to say, 'How wonderful!'" Pelosi said.
The power women should have
This is a legitimate criticism, a furious one that has been poured out for months and even years, and which she cannot express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual to me, but to you?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman, a head of a company, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a method: when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might feel sad because I was crying.
I’m really angry.”
And she just kept crying.
It seemed brilliant to me.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is one of the first jobs in an office that was largely male-dominated and where I started crying because of my unspeakable rage, and then I was grabbed by an older woman, a harsh manager, who was always a little scared of me, and dragged to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said to me.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
A Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught committing adultery on board the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snow with the seven dwarfs."
Late in the campaign, she had little time to raise money, so she vowed not to announce her candidacy until she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was an unequal fight.
She noticed that some sponsors who donated <0x24>1,000 to men donated only <0x24>250 to her.
"Did they think I was getting a discount?" she asked.
In her speech of launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported it, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly, rather than representatives, and anger over sexism – that she wept.
"You would have thought I was nervous," Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her speech.
You would have thought that I was supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking about what was going to be written in my tomb memorial.
“She was crying?”
How the US-China trade generation can benefit Beijing
The first salves in the US-China trade war have been deafened, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the strife could eventually turn into a win-win situation for Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning this year by taxing China’s main exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest strife came this week when new tariffs came into force on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) -- nearly half of China's exports to the United States.
Beijing responded to all the measures in the same way, imposing a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has sworn to fight the U.S. for a tooth, and this second-largest market in the world does not seem to be going down in the near future.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China obeyed the demands, but it would be too tricky for Chinese President Xi Jinping to bow to the US in public.
But experts say that if Beijing plays its party properly, the hardships of a trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the markets.
"The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would disrupt the economies of both countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers have admitted so far," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the New American Security Center for Asia.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country is ready to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
"Progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the territory much more stable and secure," he said.
The authorities continue to work to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists and to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against daily life and well-being.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, which defeated the US team with a final score of 16,5:10,5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has been struggling throughout the tournament, shot straight into the water from the start-up field in a 16-hole 3-day match against Francesco Molinari.
Molinari became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament took its current form.
Jordan Spieth was defeated 5:4 by Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top scorer, lost 2:1 to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, has become the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It wasn't an easy year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m very, very happy that we’ve got the cup back.
It's all up to the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help," said Garcia, emotionally embarrassed after the victory of the Europeans.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's 2:1 unit game.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods -- I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a weird statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won the 14 biggest prizes and landed only on Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the propulsion lawn all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing appearance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning was a time when we started to put pressure on Europeans.
We fought.
I'm wearing a hat before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to bend your head.
Our opponents were superior.”
"Red Flood" news: concentration in Painelas, Manatee and Sarasota is decreasing
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) said the overall concentration of the "red tide" in the Tampa Bay area is declining.
According to FWC, more fragmented flowering has been observed in the counties of Painelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that concentrations are decreasing.
The bloom of the “red tide” covers about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinelas to southern Li counties.
Blooming areas can be found about 10 miles from the coast in Hillsboro County, but fewer than last week.
"Red Flood" was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week, it was reported that the concentration was average in Pinelas County and along its coastline, along the Hillsboro County coastline from low to high, in Manati County from background to high, in Sarasota County and along the coastline from background to high, in Charlotte County from background to medium, along the Lee County coastline from background to high, and in Collie County.
Cases of respiratory irritation have still been reported in the counties of Painelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
