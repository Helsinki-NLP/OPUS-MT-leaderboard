28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco has been found dead in a stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his brother, pointing out that, "His life finally began to improve."
The body, found Wednesday outside a Westfield supermarket, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, said a spokesman for the San Francisco Forensic Medical Examination Bureau.
San Francisco police said his death was a homicide and is currently being investigated.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia tells the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he had his dream job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we will miss him very much," he said.
In this difficult time, we are thinking with Frank’s friends and family.
Lewis Galicia says that at first, Frank had stayed overnight in hostels, but recently, life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the KGO radio station.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by cooking a delicious meal and cooking lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to be involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond shining brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Telephone 415-575-4444.
Strike of young doctors: calls for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors are demanding their union to start protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LAA) Young Doctors Committee (JAK) is going to ask the council to support broader protests in early September.
JAC believes that the ministers have not been able to dispel the doubts about the agreement.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
58% of all members voted against the Treaty.
In a tweet released on Thursday evening, JAK board member Elena McCourt said the government remained silent on the issue and therefore the deal was rejected.
She said: "With this in mind, the JAK vote has resulted in a complete rejection of the contract proposal and a decision to request a new formal negotiation to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAC today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council in order to authorise the drafting of new treaties, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors have participated in six strikes, including the first time in the NHS history that they have ceased their work.
After the vote rejecting the contract conditions proposed by the AAL and recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johan Malawana, the representative of the new doctors of the AAL, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the agreement would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of dissidents?
A gesture that put an end to the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to handwriting and announcing the end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg Palace, he had the impression that Ankara needed this partnership more.
However, both of them were scattered.
The smile of Vladimir Putin looked fake and did not evoke warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
In addition, it is important to note that it is not necessary to use the drug in the presence of a large number of drugs.
I lost the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s radiant coolness shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the downing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dagger on the back of Moscow.
The transgression was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, if not impossible.
Since November, however, the public attitude of Russia has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefits from peace are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month, where he was tried to be ousted.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia’s sanctions have caused huge losses, especially the charter flight ban, which usually ensures the influx of millions of Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe relief when regular flights are resumed.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the national TV forecasts a drop in fruit and vegetable prices, as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will resume.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what they consider a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing negotiations on EU membership and Putin’s intervention, who is willing to take advantage of Turkey’s alienation from the West, can also be seen as dissatisfaction.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because the fear of regime change in the country is deeply rooted in itself.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present what an analyst called the "alliance of the outcasts", two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, despite publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, not wanting to reveal information, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The President of Turkey purposefully avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common ground on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand SKB will play a supporting role in the future, the bank’s CEO said.
Outside Scotland, the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand has been associated with the bank’s global ambitions.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and the official stock exchange list, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be on the spot.
Makevan was interviewed during a trip with customers and employees around Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The SKB will become our investor brand and our employees work with it because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will no longer sponsor Six Nations and will engage various brands in sports sponsorship.
“It’s time to become a brand bank, because we’ve long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?” says CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins the 3000th victory, winning first place in Newmarket with a horse Predilection
Detori decorates the champagne, winning his 3000th victory and finishing first in the New Market twice.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, winning first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by winning his second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, riding with Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in horse sprint races.
He's joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pete Eder and Willie Carson.
Triple champion jockey Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "This is something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very glad that it happened in Newmarket, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After winning, Detori and Predilection are welcomed with applause and exultation.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the obstacle race - champion Richard Johnson and 20th-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4,300 wins.
Leicester Pigott, nine-time derby winner, won 4,493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys, and it's no surprise that he has achieved a success that few are able to achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactics sets him apart from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attract fans to this sport.
A few weeks ago, at Epsom, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 of the races if he hadn't just taken part in the weekends and the big races.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He's a cheerful, brilliant British racer, and he's a brilliant jockey.
Frank Detori celebrated this achievement with his brand - the flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jumps, Frankie Detroit has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Ascot, and has survived an airplane crash and a disqualification for using preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his character by challenging those who questioned him, returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for some time - Detori has previously said that he would be willing to continue in the race until at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putin dismisses head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the head of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the circle of Putin's closest people for many years.
At present, the 63-year-old politician has been appointed as the Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin “has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” without giving any reason.
Ivanov is replaced by Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vine is an ex-diplomatic.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
As the website of the Kremlin (in Russian) says, he later led the protocol of the President and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main job of the administration is to support your work as President of the Republic by drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your decisions.
It’s the first time I’ve seen this movie in my life, and I’ve never seen it before.
Is your smile convincing?
This move has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a hearing broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov had resigned from office on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed to the cameras, rarely does such an explanation convince, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the struggle for power?
No one knows.
However, the official claim that the man, who was thought to be a potential president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy is perceived with great scepticism.
In comments posted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, you might even say a problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanovs took office in December 2011.
Previously he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's State Security Service, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, and Ivanov occupied the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin’s second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as Putin’s re-election for the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and three and a half years later he returned to the presidency.
The Puzzled Appearance of Fish in a Garden in Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out what kind of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels who came back with a water column.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimetres of fish got into his garden.
The crossing of the Queensphere: the bridge is now connected to Fife.
Currently, the <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphere crossing with the viaduct, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Phypha.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The structure of the Fifa bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
Currently, the <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Secretary of Economics, Kate Brown, had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only this part used more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the final section connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road to the land section or viaduct.
This was done by moving the section of the northern access viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
The viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled inclined by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions, with which the team worked, was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simone Bailes collects gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Baill is not worried about this.
Dynamic jumps.
Do exercises on a beam effortlessly.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Absolutely impeccable.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was ahead of the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raismane and bronze medal winner Russian athlete Alija Mustafina.
On Thursday, US athlete Simone Bails performed exercise on a beam of gymnastics in the individual multiplayer final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bilse became the fourth consecutive American to win the title of multi-course champion and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, as the long road to that moment was over.
This achievement ranks him among such unbeatable athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to a different level.
Bilse has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals, performing such outstanding, precise and ambitious exercise combinations that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
In Brazil, she faced her final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with her expectations, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
In addition, it is important to note that in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to ensure that the rules of the internal market are applied in a manner that is compatible with the internal market.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for the team coordinator Marta Karolji.
Although Bilse says she had not expected anything like this on her long journey to the summits of fame, it is not true.
Some of her performance-free movements, which include her special acrobatic transition, are accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly into the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and discovered by the mother of coach Amy Burman on a trip to the gym where B<0xC5><0xAB>rmane’s lambs were held, has now become a force to be considered.
She hasn't lost in a multi-competition since the summer of 2013 and the series of victories can continue as long as Bailsa wants.
Although Mustafina took a slight lead during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balancing beam and free movement - the part of the race where Bails will defend her championship title - is still ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on the beam and strengthened the leadership with a score of 15,933 free movements
Raismane gently embraced her while they waited for the results, which was just a formality and she burst into tears of joy when the dream she had once written in her notebook came true.
The result of Raismane was a slight revenge for four years of events, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother", took over the convincing leadership.
After performing in free movements, which allayed doubts about her return, she was able to devote herself to a crowd of air kisses.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bailsa’s viral Twitter post r, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives a bullet-punched shooting in Philadelphia.
Police said the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, saying he was the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents at CBS confirmed to the Philadelphia News Channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez tells television: "His little body was just bullet-punched."
I can't believe that.
The boy has been hospitalized in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family tells him that he will certainly recover.
He had to go to first grade in a local primary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in a part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, while the other two victims are in a stable condition.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether there was an attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
In the place of the event, gun cartridge tubes, which belong to different weapons, were found.
It looks like it's been a long shot.
Is there anything you can do about it?
"It looks like there were several armed shooters active in the shooting," said Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
No one has yet been detained and it is reported that the police are checking surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, a stray bullet hit a 6-year-old girl while she was playing in front of her house in Westoukland.
She is recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athletic Team of the Year for several reasons.
First of all, I have been at all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, the team consists of three athletes, Simone Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laury Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that this team includes Alija Rysmane, who is Jewish, and Madison Cociana, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabija took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became an Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champions Simone Bils, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win a gold medal in an individual women's battle.
She won a silver medal with her teammate Alija Raismane.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country, the situation in gymnastics lessons is completely different.
Simona, Gabija, and Laurija entered the Olympic team in the same way as Alija and Madison.
In addition, the European Commission has announced that it will continue to monitor the implementation of the EU-US Privacy Shield and the EU-US Privacy Shield.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts are mostly trained in private athletics clubs and are supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford the sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their workouts, and this is an expensive and long-lasting investment for athletic families.
Amy Boorman - coach of Simone Biles and Maggie Haine - coach of Laurie Hernandez has been coaching their athletes since both girls began to engage in athletics.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabija and Laurija with cheaper gymnastic training options.
I founded my own athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is based in Haarlem and we offer more than 15,000 gymnastics sessions for young people in the city (mostly black and Spanish) for free or at a low price.We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and goal-orientedness.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it's fantastic.
Engaging in this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for a great demonstration of "Girls Force", winning Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s rejection, the new doctors plan to expand more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement to amend the agreement with the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to sign a contract, pointing out that the NHS is in a fragile state and further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that provides for changes to the conditions of night work and weekend work to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Elena Makourta, a representative of BMA’s young doctors, said that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labor crisis and that it does not create a level playing field for all doctors.
Eight weeks remain until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress must be made, as there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been met with the government's reluctance to engage, and sometimes with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt has to take immediate action, stop inaction, and work with young doctors.
If he does not do this, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to picket.
The ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for work on weekends for 54,000 young doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment CEO Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase pressure on busy workers and cause concern, stress and distress to patients, carers and their families.
In the last two months we have spoken with the committee of new doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and reporters.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of employees, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, drop-outs and gender pay inequalities in medicine - shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The drug for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, as officials recommend it to more people and for a longer period of time.
Anticoagulants Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a recurrent heart attack.
NHS representative NICE recommends using this product for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NHS NICE currently recommends using this drug for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the cardiovascular risk.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack, and one in four of them suffer a repeat heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If, on the other hand, the blood clot breaks off from the blood vessel wall, it can go further into the bloodstream and block the blood's access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having a recurrent heart attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for another 3 years.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of Health Technology at NICE, explains: “Despite the availability of medication to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences.”
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and infarctions in people who have had them in the past.
With the preliminary recommendation of treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options for thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use beyond this period.
Political correctness culture promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, the former mayor of Towerhamlett, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed for corruption.
The government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is closing the eyes to large-scale cheating in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticises the police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the election process because they are "fearful of violating ethnic and religious interests."
A former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so widespread that the police should allow guards to be deployed at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a personal identification document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only need to provide their name and address.
He even suggests marking the fingers of the voters who voted with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Whistleblowers should also be given greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He felt that the press should be given greater access to the Council's documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says, "The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Downing Street after the scandal surrounding the elections in Towerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to remove the Mayor Lutfur Rahman from the post of Mayor of the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the notion that the religious duty of Muslim believers is to vote for him."
Approximately 300 votes were fake or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly worrying to be cheating on the postal vote, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a personal identification document to ascertain the identity of a person.
His report states: "Evidence suggests that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for candidates chosen by the elders of the communities, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that the county authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be offended."
Sir Eric set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes banning political activists from acting on votes cast by post to prevent "voting".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more rigorous check of enrolment to prevent electoral rolls from being used for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to present a personal identification document before voting.
Mark the fingers of voters with special ink to avoid double voting.
Systematically verify the nationality of the person to make sure that the person is entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes cast by post and ballot envelopes for voting by post.
Ensure the police have the power to appoint security guards at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate prosecution of individuals for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit photography at polling stations.
Require only English to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Enhance training to ensure that polling station staff go to polling stations one by one.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Metropolitan Police, saying that there are no charges in the Towerhamlet case.
He says: "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for acts involving corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly found guilty according to the standard of criminal evidence, based on conclusive evidence.
It’s also a good idea to check the number of check marks in the registration offices of the city council voters.
Sir Eric points out: "Last year's court decision is a bell to alarm.
Our land is known as the birthplace of the parliament, but the alarming and latent spread of election fraud and the pretense of the authorities that fraud does not take place threaten this good reputation.

The athlete himself also noticed the storm in social media and admitted that he was compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity except for beard," Brady tells the Huffington Post.

CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for commenting that the Chinese swimmer has “dead like a pig”.
Byron McDonald’s analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha finishing fourth in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women caused a storm of indignation among CBC viewers.
Canada's CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "departed from the competition because she stinked" and "dead like a pig".
The commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when the women of the 4x200 m freestyle relay presented their personal opinion at the end of the final.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC's commentary team to give the comments liveliness, said: "That little 14-year-old from China is unable to keep up with."
"Too entangled, she flew away from the race, stinked and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana scored 1:57.79 in the second round, which is 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rucka scored, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Audiences across Canada reacted instantly on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expression.
Emmet McFarlane tweeted: "Did a direct CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"????
The idiot did not realize that they were still in direct air.
Ai Yanha from China in the 4x200m freestyle final for women was named "the little fourteen-year-old girl from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism of Byron McDonald quickly became strong, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe it when they heard Byron McDonald’s insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Wow, <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and for you we all sound like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who then led CBC's live broadcast, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We're sorry that the comment on the swimming score came live."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who responded to the comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We deeply regret that such comments have been made and that they have gone live.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all viewers and followers of live broadcasts on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, and not addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessful choices, and Byron was very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized personally on live broadcast and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
He said on CBC Olympics live: "I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I am talking about the performance of a swimmer, not about her personally.
Needless to say, I was not going to show disrespect, and I am really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly hangs out in the middle of a lingerie store.
Buyers were embarrassed when the woman started undressing to try on panties in the middle of the store.
To further aggravate the situation, she tried them to make sure they fit her, and then she took them off by putting them back on the store shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping mall and used four more panties.
Primark’s Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – the place where this woman put her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, there was also a mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who said that the unfamiliar woman, after wearing underwear, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She said people couldn’t believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants off the shelf, took off her tights and pants and measured them right there.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them on the spot.
Everyone watched her take off her panties and apparently the woman did not like them, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
She didn't seem to be worried that anyone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Ms. Davidson, 33, from Kent, says: "Derdz's idea is that someone will buy clothes that another person has used and that haven't been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson adds: "I assume that the shop staff removed the clothes from the shelves after she left - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine buying new underwear and finding out that another woman has tried them and then they haven’t washed them.
A spokesman for Primark said that Primark was aware of the incident, which took place on Tuesday, August 9.
The specific clothes have been removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in the near distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga Grandmaster from New York, Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or from the back, this video shows you how to defend yourself and take the lead over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if an attacker attacks from behind, then you must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the shooting trajectory.
Then the gun should be grasped between your front arm and shoulder and hit the opponent's face with your free elbow.
Then a knee-wise kick in the groin, and while the attacker freezes in pain, he must be taken off his gun, hit in his face with a gun claw, and retreat, continuing to point the gun against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - you should avoid the trajectory of the shot, grab the gun and fold it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, you need to put pressure on the gun and hit the opponent by the chest, and finally take his gun and step back while continuing to aim at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki is doing.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Mag, it's safer to give your money back to the robber.
The Vandal family is demolishing the Saltas Cornwall Social House and being put out on the street.
The vandal family has been evicted for terrorising neighbours, damaging the social home for <0xC2><0xA3>50,000.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebillwood were just made from a property in Saltas Cornwall because of several complaints against them.
When they were forcibly expelled from the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, rubbish was scattered everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now expelled from the property and most likely living in some private property.
Donna Makevoya, the manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there are fears that the house will not be renovated.
She tells us that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like that.
In this case, a number of factors should be considered, since from now on this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed in the property, and the police say their terror consisted of violence, raiding the streets with baseball sticks, bullying the locals, drug use, drug sales, and loud whipping and swearing.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
In some rooms of the demolished house was found scattered waste.
In the house, where previously drugs may have been traded, several floorboards have also been pulled out.
Neighbors say they fought regularly on the streets and were constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of the property after they had been given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the eviction, because their life was supposedly an absolute hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about other people.”
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
It's unbelievable how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the Head of Neighbourhood Protection at the Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
In the overgrown garden of the house, various old and unusable objects were found.
He also said, "It is very unfortunate that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because eviction from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard to watch their behavior.
I appreciate the work of my entire team, the Devonian and Cornwall Police, and the members of the community, who were courageous and co-operated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will facilitate the lives of neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said all three of his sons lived here at different times, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after eviction.
Employees of the service will now have to clean up the pile of garbage left in the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, utensils and 1700 pounds of cash.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
She insisted that the money was for a monument to her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it has become known that they are currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
There were many graffiti on the walls of the house.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their leases.
In addition, it is important to note that it is important to take into account all the factors that affect the development of the disease, such as the age of the child.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and that there will be no consequences."
The police in Devon and Cronwall do not accept criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Readiness to spend can boost the economy.

The Mayor of Cannes banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort of Cannes has banned wearing a burkini swimsuit that almost completely covers a woman's body and resembles a wetsuit, local officials said Thursday.
Mayor of Cannes David Linard has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"A beach suit that displays religious affiliation in a time when France and cult sites are the target of terrorist attacks can create a risk of disturbances of public order (mudges, clashes, etc.) that need to be prevented," the order said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outer clothing, which is associated with trust in the terrorist movements that are fighting with us," explained municipal utilities chief Thierry Migul.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since July 28, when a member of the centre-right party "Republicans" Linars signed this order and it came into force.
The water park in the city of Marseille this week cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would wear burkini swimsuits, as both right-wing and left-wing politicians expressed outrage at the event.
France bans the wearing of face-shielded headgear for Muslim women, but does not ban religious symbols or clothing.
In July 14, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack carried out by the Islamic State group in Nice, near Cannes.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the "Islamic State" brutally murdered priests in a church in northwestern France.
Is it possible to get rid of this disease?
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug in the treatment of the disease is not always possible, but it is important to take into account the fact that the drug is not used in the treatment of the disease.
The turnover of the company in 2014 was EUR 22.57 million.

This year, like other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.

The festival "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" has started in Lucavsala.
In the evening of Thursday, August 11, in Lucavsala, one of the last festivals of this summer started - there will be "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" until Sunday night.
The first evening gathered was pampered by such groups as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but disappeared from the program without notice, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the band "The Prodigy" and others.
In the next days of the festival, the programme also contains notable names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", drummer of the punk legend "Ramones" Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the Belarusian punk rock leader Sergey Mihalok, a popular Georgian actor and singer.
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" is held in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and enormous losses, but it did not prevent the organizers from retrying - they added a tag to the title, included a Latvian group in the program (on Friday evening at 7:15 p.m. on the stage "All Day Long" stairs) and announced that now the festival has become "closer and acquired local colors alongside such symbols of Riga as its panoramic and cats".
It is still too early to say if these efforts will be successful, because the festival has just entered, but, as the first night watched "Delfi Entertainment", at least for now, it has not succeeded in attracting huge crowds of people and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British trekking team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British trekking team doubled the Olympic record on Thursday and won the sprint race for men.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualification, but in the first round of the competition it was re-corrected by the New Zealanders.
In the finals of the sprint, the British team met with New Zealand, and the British deprived the New Zealanders of the title of holders of the Olympic record, leaving them with silver medals.
The British team won the final with a score of 42,440 seconds, beating New Zealand by 0.102 seconds.
In the bronze battle, the French team beat Australia.
In addition, the record was also broken in the qualification of the women's race - the British team broke the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The President, who remained in the shade: Gustav Zemgale - 145.
On Friday, August 12, it is 145 years since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgal proclaimed the state of Latvia, but left in the shadow of the widely described first president of Latvia, J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akste, and the last president of the pre-war period, K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis.
No one else in our country has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgale, writes Arnolds Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> in a book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgale published ten years ago.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
Others are so stiff, always very right.
He taught not to be so, nowadays it could be similar to what Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis is.
“He was one who was close to the people,” says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Modern politicians know history badly, they referred to K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis as a good leader, but few people know how furious he has been.
The only person to sit in the government to whom he did not scream was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smiling in the pictures, by nature he was hysterical.
It’s not the only thing you can do to get rid of it.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market (Single European Digital Single Market – Digital Single Market) in order to assess the impact of the Digital Single Market on the digital economy.
He also notes that Zemgale has stood out with respect for minorities and has regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not a custom, after the presidency of Zemgale, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and steadfast man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He didn't want it, he just didn't hungry for fame.
He was also quite critical of himself, because he did not know French, but he felt that the president had to be able to do so.
"During the presidency, the basics of French were learned," explains Stranga.
He was not allowed to be repeatedly persuaded to stand as a candidate, he did not like such high positions at all.
In all respects, he is a very respectable personality in the history of Latvia, already before entering the presidential palace he held a serious position - he was a highly demanded notary.
He also headed the famous Zemgala treasury at 3 Suvorova Street, where the Association of Savings and Savings Makers was located, where practically the Latvian state was formed during the government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
It was not a big fan of Ulmanis, but publicly did not object to him either.
“In private conversations, however, he has sometimes said that he is not really sympathetic to Ulmanis’ actions,” says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, without any suspicion of irregularity or corruption.
How is Zemgale remembered nowadays?
It is unfortunate, but for most of them he is associated with just one street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and the views were central.
"There were no major shocks during his time, that is, he could associate with such a truly stable presidency," Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustavs Zemgalis, from 1927 to 1930, a Latvian state visit to Sweden took place, which at that time implicitly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and integration into the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale visited Stockholm.
The response visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the appearance of anger, anger of the child is considered by parents to be something wrong and insane.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Ekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression - this is already a physical action directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about our anger, we can kick the couch, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, bang a bullet on the table and do other things that we don’t usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
When children are angry, they do not understand what happens to them, how to call them, and how to live with them.
They can say: "Go away!", You are a fool, "Bad Mom", "I don't see you", "I will not be friends with you" - and very rarely, when you can say, "I'm angry with you."
Children live in the literal sense, they are fully present here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and sincere in the expression of their feelings, and often also in the captivity of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, do not shame about it and do not resent it, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long working day, where things haven’t gone as you would like, or just a bad mood – there are so many reasons why you’d like to “disconnect” from the world for a moment, a day, or even longer.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a while and breathe in a little?
Or does it show that each of the partners has its own way to go?
They share their opinions with men of different ages.
John (23) is brief and concise: "In my opinion, if you need a pause in your relationships, then you are not with the right person."
In the meantime, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may possibly help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get nervous about every little detail, then surely - this is the right time to explore other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or especially do not think about him or do not even want to see him anymore.
So the answer is yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, in relationships one should pause from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then quarrels are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail of what the other is doing, and it begins to fall on your nerves.
People start to bother with each other, especially when there is nothing to talk about, just what you have done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that it is better elsewhere or with someone else, then why does this woman with whom you are together deserve someone who can think that there is not enough good here and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I slightly condemn those who don't." says Edmunds (46).
(33) is quite the opposite.
I think everyone needs a moment of rest.
You can't look each other's eyes at every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice at the endless love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, a girlfriend or wife too, but if both of them are able to maintain the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's it, that's it.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, Member States should be able to take all necessary measures to ensure that the rules of the internal market are applied in a manner that is consistent with the Union's internal market.
If this question arises, then it is to be expected that there will be some changes in the near future - for the better or for the worse, it depends on ourselves.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, you need a break - at least all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there is no question of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society now and need a breath from time to time, then what will happen when you are retired, commenting on how passing cats hate or arguing about which day the garden should be better weaned," Kristaps (19) explains.
All the names of the masters have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls was the first to awaken the Latvian people’s interest in fine arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable forever," Romans Suta wrote about Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls, the old master of Latvian painting.
Also in 2016, when the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition was unveiled in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is open to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours the painter Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is included in the UNESCO Celebration Calendar, with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall.
The retrospective exhibition, featuring more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls’ anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classical creative activity, stylistic variation and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Axel Gallen-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the interplay of certain works of art with the photographs taken by the painter himself with his own camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, simultaneously offers the first stop of a small informative travelling exhibition "With a Look in Finland, with a Heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exposition with a content presentation in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in autumn at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.

In addition, it is important to note that in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to ensure that the rules of the internal market are applied in a manner that is consistent with the principles of the internal market.
So far, nothing is officially happening.
"If so, the BBC will announce it," Leblanc told TV critics.
The question of the future of "Gas on the Floor!" arose in July when Le Blanc's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the program.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanc and "The Gas on the Floor!" were "as created for each other."
Evans describes the former star of the series "Friends" as a "true and good man", thus dispelling rumors that the friendship between the two had broken down during the filming.
When Leblanc was asked what he liked most in the show, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reports that the show does not plan to replace Evans in the new season 24.

The backstage of the business of US models in his interpretation has gained the perverse glamour of a sophisticated photo shoot and the intolerance of a horror film.
Basically, a very provocative work balancing sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to trace the boundaries between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre product territory.
The film with Vigo Mortensen focuses on the question of whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and separation from the gluttony and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.

The Islamic State captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The European Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Directive on the protection of the environment and of the environment against the use of pesticides in the production and marketing of products and services.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them while fleeing to Jerabbul," a spokesman for the Kurdish military council of Menbizh said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, said Friday that Menbiz had been freed from jihadists.
The Islamic state occupied Menbiz in 2014.
The QSD already last week expelled most of the Islamic State militants from Menbizh, but some persisted and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, bringing prisoners with them.
Islamists are heading to Jer-Abuso, on the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based group of Syrian activists, also reported that the Islamic State kidnapped some 2,000 people.
The SOHR reported that Islamists kidnapped people's cars, forced them into them, and then took them to Jerraboul.
The Islamic State militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists captured more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the eastern Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor.
Later, some 270 of the prisoners were released by Islamists.
It is not known how many Islamic militants escaped from Menbizh.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbizh Military Council said the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people held hostage by Islamists in Menbizh.

In the event that her candidacy would be approved by the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow to fully work and implement the necessary changes in the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, full-fledged work would not be possible, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment the whole process of my candidacy is over-politicized," he said.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have received, this is an experience that I appreciate as a benefit," Kolegova writes in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
In addition, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have launched a series of public consultation campaigns on the future of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).

The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all five recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the implementation of the Infrastructure Development project on Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the Board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the State Audit Office, when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport of Riga Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations provided for the improvement of the project management in the subsequent stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the NC today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the State Audit Office on the usefulness of implementing the Krievu Island project, we are very responsible towards the implementation of the project and the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasize that all the planned construction works within the framework of the project have been fully completed within the specified deadlines and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the State Audit Office and the stevedore, that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding project management and monitoring issues," says the project manager of Krievu Island, Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the achievement of the project goal was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring tools of the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the goal of the project by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the State Audit Office, is supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening the time-limit control of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Free Port of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a new project management plan has been developed, defining the project management areas and indicating the developed documents that ensure the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a structure chart of the project management has been developed, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualification and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication of the Freeport of Riga Authority with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the parties interested in the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, it will be necessary to provide a more detailed justification for the necessity of entering into a service contract or starting a procurement, as well as for the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure conforming to world standards has been built on Krievu Island - four new deep-water berths, railway accesses, as well as engineering communications.
The constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the last year, achieving a saving of EUR 10.6 million in funding.

"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
The European Union (EU) summit will take place in the Slovak capital on September 16th, and will be attended by all the bloc's countries except Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and the future of the EU without Great Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the number of deaths near the border of former East Germany under the Communist yoke could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims still remain.
According to figures released Wednesday by Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall Museum, 1841 people were murdered by communist authorities trying to escape their territory between 1945 and 1989 on the border with the western allied areas and later West Germany.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and adjusts the number of casualties from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to reach West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are deserters of the Soviet army.
“The final extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented,” said Alexandra Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to flee the Communist-controlled country are cleaned up and not lost," Hildebrante said in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is not convincing," Johen Staats, an expert on East German history at the Free University of Berlin, said in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have been able to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that only at the Berlin Wall were communists murdering 138 people.
Taking into account those people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or reach the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims, according to the State, could reach about a thousand.
But it is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the differences in the number of victims could be the differences in methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not related to direct violence.
“If seniors between 70 and 80 years old died from a heart attack after shrinking under border control, that should be the consequences of this ‘murdering border’,” Hildebrante said.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between old people who may have died as a result of their treatment and those whose death was caused by long waiting in hot weather on a bus at the border.
It is not easy to record the victims, as the communist authorities in East Germany did not collect such statistics, and the researchers must extract the documents in various scattered archives, state.
However, the State Group recently found new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The President of the LPF Mr. went to Rio with a coach’s accreditation; it’s a surprise for himself.

In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 6 years.
"Evidently, however, for objective reasons he did not," said Mr. Pone, expressing the opinion that this did not affect Ribakov's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvya's coach took on the task of helping her.
It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this movie, and I’ve never seen it before.
In my opinion, it is unethical to approve five persons in the Executive Committee of the LAK and not to bring any of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation wasn't enough," Mr. said that the public did not appreciate the work of the federation and their presidents, recalling that the presidents of the federations do not receive salaries.
In addition, he criticized Jakubovski, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not confirmed among the participants, he filed a complaint with the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.

600,000 juveniles of salmon will be introduced into the Daugava River.
During the Latvenergo JSC fish resources recovery program this week in Daugava near Manga<0xC4><0xBC>sala the release of salmon and sea trout juveniles takes place, and this year it is planned to release more than 600,000 year old salmon and sea trout juveniles raised in the fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Dole.
If you’re not sure what to do, you’re probably not sure what to do, but you’re sure that you’ll be able to do it yourself.
In spring and early summer of 2016 pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - fish, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zander and vimba.
Latvenergo Production Director M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC5><0x86>ickis said that taking care of the environment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, each activity is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by breeding and placing of juveniles in the Daugava basin, and by implementing other activities," Kunickis said.
This year, more than 600,000 year-old salmon and sea trout pups will be introduced to the Daugava estuary.
For the second year, the fry are marked by cutting off the fat belly before being introduced.
The cargo brought today contains 25 000 juveniles of salmon with an average weight of 31,3 grams.
Each year, in scientifically justified species composition and number in the Daugava River and its basin water bodies, the release of juveniles and larvae takes place.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River and its basin water bodies in accordance with regulatory enactments is carried out by Bior, on the basis of an expert-examination of the damage caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo’s economic activity and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures should be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
In its turn, the State Environmental Service shall, on the basis of the abovementioned expert-examination, take a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation amount of Latvenergo for the fishery resources recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We fish" for the fifth year, place 400 artificial fish spawning nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>ile.
Cooperation with the association, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resources recovery programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River.
The festival "Sansus<0xC4><0xAB> Concert Hall" has a country yard, forest, felling.

The festival will take place in the yard of the former parish house in Sus<0xC4><0x93>ja, a village that no longer exists, next to the forests and fellings.
On three days - from August 12 to 14 - you can combine the exquisite enjoyment of nature and academic music on five stages.
Here, theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile in the face and lightness in the legs is only a few minutes.
"Please do not search for the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusi can be captured only by spending all three days in it," invites the initiator and host of the festival, opera baritone Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The festival gates are open on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be programs on the site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9 a.m. to the next dawn.
“The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv”, says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The magnificent bouquet of artists includes, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist J<0xC4><0x81>nis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zari<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross.
New works have also been created specially for the festival.
The performance "Kukanis" for children, composed by Olesja Kozlovska and J<0xC4><0x93>kabs N<0xC4><0xAB>manis, based on F. Kafka’s story of Transformation, will be attended by U<0xC4><0xA3>is Piter<0xC4><0x81>ns, an entomologist (insect researcher), along with Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, musicians and actors.
Oskars Herli<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> has composed the first String Quartet, while Anna <0xC4><0xB6>irse has composed the Tree Opera, a performance, the main characters of which in the directing of Andris Kalnozols with Katr<0xC4><0xAB>na Neiburga’s video projects and Andris Egl<0xC4><0xAB>tis’ scenography will be trees in three small clusters in a three-hectare wide open-cut.
When singing in the voices of Laima Ledi<0xC5><0x86>a, D<0xC4><0xAB>ra Rud<0xC4><0x81>ne and Zigmars Gra<0xC5><0xA1>s, they will enter into a romantic relationship, just like in a study by Swedish natural scientist of the Enlightenment K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Linn<0xC4><0x81>js on Tree Weddings (1729).

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party of the Senate has blocked Garland's approval since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
The leader of the majority of the Senate, Mitch Maconnell, announced that the next president will choose who will replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Skali.
On Thursday, during his conference, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
In addition, it is important to note that it is not necessary to use the drug in the first place.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "shake the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the District Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "inserts" and act in the interests of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.

This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the creation of a calendar, Shaw tells us: "We have to return to the unwavering and classic nakedness in pictures, where a woman's body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or personally during casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review

A French court rejects the demand for the demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected a call by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a hearing in Calais this week, the authorities said the state should dismantle 72 self-made shops, where people sell goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The Prefect's Office of Calais pointed out that these self-established companies should be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small enterprises are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of inhabitants continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling the people who created the 72 self-made shops, but it understands the concerns of the prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food for people who live in "extremely humble conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp's "Jungle Book Kids" café, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French lessons and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of children's cafes.
A letter to the Guardian said the liquidation of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, Aid for Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of inhabitants of the “Jungle” camp has risen to 9,000, the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.

Fiji demonstrated a master class in ball management, balls played with a leg, in a support game and in a game of brutal force, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought an honorable award of consolation - a silver medal, which was the third medal of Britain that day. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
But in any case, Fiji's team is in its best shape right now to win the 15-man team.
Although unlikely, a certain consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won a gold medal. This is the Fiji national team's head coach Ben Ryan, a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all of their games in rugby-7 in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started the match, repelling the British power techniques for pleasure.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his companions, it was like a rush with several opposite buses, and the World Series Champions took the lead 5:0 when Ossea Kolinisau scored the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai further increased the lead by realizing a landing on the right wing.
It’s also a good idea to start a new business.
The great power of Mitchell prevented Leoni Nakarava from gaining three points, but this had only a small impact on Fiji's score.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a landing in the right corner, consolidating the lead over Great Britain to 17-0.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British power techniques and crossed the line to score points.
The landing secured a score of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still studying.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a major change in half time, breaking the Fiji player line... full four minutes, which was good by the first half time standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic match, scored a few more points for Fiji.
In addition, the European Commission has adopted a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) to ensure that the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has access to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).
You can't fail to admire Fiji's cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliema made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
With the end of the game whistle, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British could sit down in the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British outperformed South Africa, where both teams scored the landing in a very hard fight and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown took the lead of the Boxing team, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with shining skill and brought the ball between the poles, ensuring the British won.
Markus Watson, the brother of England's rugby-15 team player Antony, won and won another silver medal at the end of the game.
Hel<0xC4><0x93>na Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by the coach's fight against cancer to win the rowing race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last turn, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Heather Stanning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes on board, they were accompanied by Robin Williams' echo, which inspired them to win the second Olympic gold medal in pair rowing for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They were undoubtedly dominant because for the 39th time they won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with the elegance of a swan gliding on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal there stands a team of riders who work hard to ensure that athletes continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success was made by a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would experience the day because he had been diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on, and it happened.
If not, it would spread all over the body.
And the situation would become out of control.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I walked distances of 6, 10, or even 15 meters, although the doctor said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it all started.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very worried all morning and in the mood of excitement spoke more than usual.
Staninga, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much work Helen and Robin have done.
The three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t have achieved anything, so a big thank you to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I can’t think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost in any race in five years.
The pair reaches a speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, Staning and Glover were overwhelmed.
We felt every moment.
Helen screamed, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Staying focused is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we didn’t have high expectations.
We didn’t want to break records that day, but just to row well and win the race, and that’s what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Baxal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Is it possible to get rid of this disease?
In addition, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have launched a series of public consultation campaigns aimed at identifying potential risks for the euro area and the euro area.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 6 years.
If now it starts to change its position in the selection of the candidate for the position of the SRS head, then it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
If you are not sure what to do, then you need to know what to do and what to do.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 6 years.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he was not considering other candidates for the position of the SRS head.
In addition, the head of the parliamentary group of the National Alliance, Raivis Dzintars, admitted that the NA continues to support Kolegov under the leadership of the SRS.
In Spain, the impossibility of forming a government is jeopardising the ability to reduce the budget deficit.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficiently large measures to reduce the deficit level to the euro area's required 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
Estimates show that, despite the austerity measures put in place, the deficit in Portugal was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the short term.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on these two countries, however, is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions for such a negative mood would only multiply.
The European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, said that Europe is losing trust in this way, giving citizens the impression that the rules of the European Union are recommending rather than binding.
The European Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for correcting their deficits to Portugal by the end of this year and to Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by the two countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Preliminary forecasts suggest that the target set for Portugal could be met in due time and the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product already this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation efforts should amount to 0.5% of GDP per annum over the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on the formation of a government for eight months has made it particularly difficult to achieve these goals, and there is a growing possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the third elections would not change the political picture in the country significantly.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who would again win less than 33% of the votes.
Only the socialists have gained some popularity, while the anti-austerity parties "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" have lost some popularity.
The People's Party wants socialists and Ciudadanos to join the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the 2017 draft budget to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
If the government is not formed and parliamentary elections are held for a third time, Spain will become a mockery for the whole of Europe, according to the People's Party's parliamentary group, Rafael Hernando.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In the fifth year of surveying the beaches, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of litter found is increasing every year, and this is mainly due to the visitors of bathing sites.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
In the city council, it is explained that bathing sites are cleaned up every day, but it is quite difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on the land can be leached into the water during rainfall, thereby significantly degrading its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This is a statement made this week by the volunteers of the My Sea campaign.
In the fifth year of walking along the Gulf of Riga, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
This year, however, the criticism has come to an end.
"We see that this will be the year when the amount of waste on the beach 100 meters may possibly even exceed 200 units", says J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
He was on the beach of Tuja, where the march of volunteers continues along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, among various household waste and picnic survivors, activists had to collect even fluorescent lamps that were left tossed in the sea sand.
It’s not the only thing you can do to get rid of it.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various kinds of waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the process of decomposition, they can no longer be identified, and cigarettes, bottles, corks," Ulme says.
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also bathing areas in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, on average for every hundred meters, almost 800 waste units have been collected, which is critically high.
The campaign organisers also explain that almost every step of the way there are also smokers and not everywhere there are warning or prohibition signs.
"Average figures for all three bathing areas in Riga combined - Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, Vak<0xC4><0x81>bul<0xC4><0xBC>i and Vec<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0xB7>i - unfortunately turn out to be large and far beyond the desired or goal, which is supposedly Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020," concludes the environmental defender.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
In addition, it is important to take into account the fact that it is possible to have a large number of children in the first year of life.
It’s a good idea to have a good time with your family.
Can be called the police, confidently point to these violations and in this way all fight.
It may be possible to impose some new warnings, but, as I said, it is unlikely that this will change the situation radically.
"As we all have to go together and be intolerant of such offenders," he said.
This is the first time in the history of the United States.
This year, however, as in other years, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing sites have always had good water quality and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"The last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," says Normunds Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is, the senior environmental health specialist of the Inspectorate.
Waste left on land may be discharged into the water during heavy rains.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to the environmental specialist.
The rotation in the Russian elite continues - the change of leader under Putin's administration.
Lost your job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov himself wanted to leave the office and will be the president’s special representative for nature protection, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin addressed to Ivanov in front of the television cameras the words of appreciation: "Dear Sergei Borissovich, we have been working together with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am pleased with the way in which you are performing the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well our agreement not to keep you in this post of head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
That is why I understand your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that in your new position you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the management of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In addition, it is important to note that it is not necessary to use the drug in the presence of a large number of drugs.
Ivanov was also called a possible substitute for Putin for the presidency, so the statement that he himself wanted to occupy the office of a representative of the president for environmental protection and transport issues raised doubts.
It’s a great way to get to know each other.
Ivanov was a long-time and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his career in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, at the end of the reign of Boris Yeltsin, the first President of Russia, he was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Doctrine of Information Security" was approved, which, among other things, provided for the resurrection of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became Minister of Defence of Russia, and already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry enterprises and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the office of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration will now also work.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
The position of the head of the presidential administration Vaina was suggested by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovi<0xC4><0x87> and I have been acquainted for a long time.
It was from the time we were in government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we have been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am convinced that after all professional and personal character traits he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet publication Meduza, referring to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence", writes that at the end of the 1980s, Karl Vine had asked Moscow to allow the use of force against demonstrators.
He was refused, however, and soon lost his position.
Shortly afterwards, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the presidential protocol administration.
In the last few weeks, Russia has been shaken by the suspension and even arrests of several senior officials, including the replacement of several county governors and federal representatives.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who’s not a good person.
One of the main features - more and more often representatives of the power structures are coming to the top positions.
Is it possible to get rid of the disease?
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian Judo wrestler has ended his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of the European Union (EU) or the United Kingdom (EU).
He also discovered that the judo wrestler had a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is important to note that in order to get to the Olympic road signs, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
If you’re not sure what to do, you’re probably not sure what to do, but you’re sure that you’ll be able to do it yourself.
So Latvia has concluded the judo competition in Rio.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by Judith Evgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but the ambitious ones can sometimes surprise him.
He didn't.
The task of Art<0xC5><0xAB>rs Nikiforenko was even more difficult, as the experience was smaller and the opponent respectable.
The result is similar, although he stayed on the tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately, Latvian judists lack the most ambition.
If you’re not sure what you’re looking for, you’re probably wondering if you’re going to be able to do it.
For Jackevich, who advises Kazakh judists here, and for Vsevolds Zelonis, heirs are not seen.
But if they don’t, they won’t.
This is the prerogative of the federation.
This is why the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised to win medals in Rio, like from another galaxy in the "Morning Panorama".
A flight far from reality.
In the evening we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
It’s the same as in the “death” group – the losers have ended their games.
It’s a great way to get to know people who are not interested in you.
The tension was increased by the long-running previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy card swirled throughout the match.
The wind caused additional problems for the players.
At first, it seemed that it could be our ally - which is more comprehensive.
But it didn't.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
Serve to Samoylov and wait for him to break.
This is the first time in the history of the European Union that the European Union has been involved in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
In addition, it is important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States, where the number of people who are in the United States is higher than the number of people who are in the United States.
It’s a great way to get to know people who aren’t interested in you.
The third one was already in the service sign of Evandra.
A chain was formed - an unconvincingly captured serv<0xC4><0xAB>te, the second pass often flies too close to the network and Samoilov had very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger Samoilov on the square against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and it would be unprofessional to put a loss only on Sasha.
It’s a good idea to take a look at a few of these things.
The team loses.
This time there was definitely a lack of luck - in the third set alone, two Evandru attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two runs were next to the line.
The contentious episode of the video also decided in favor of the opponents.
In the first two games, Evandra was tormented by the servants, then they were very productive against ours.
All of this was a loss on the scoreboard.
Now the causes of failure must be calmly analysed.
Maybe you should have lived as many people next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the road.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
Perhaps Klagenfurt shouldn’t have played, but sooner to come here and better to acclimatize.
Maybe there was a failure with finding the peak of the athletic shape.
So far, more questions than answers.
The game is over for our beekeepers.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
It’s also a good time to start a new business.
It’s important to remember that you can’t get rid of all of the bad habits that you have.
But it is also not necessary.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of a divorce may also arise, because the blame will be sought not only in yourself, but also in your partner.
It is not difficult to make a decision, but it will be much harder to find a decent partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play a beat, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, and Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
It is possible to try Haralds Reg<0xC5><0xBE>s, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars To<0xC4><0x8D>s to return to M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Plavi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, but it will not be better than this option, which has proved itself more than once in the World Cup stages.
The sand of Copacabana did not smile at them this time.
That's it.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs are entering the circulation, and only the rare one is less than two meters tall.
This is not yet a guarantee of success, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Ours does not stay taller.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to accommodate in the places offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic Village.
Some beach volleyball players have also found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the prices for the very modest accommodation offered to journalists were greatly exaggerated.
So the choice fell on the rent of apartments.
There is a risk, because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
Beach 200 meters away, half an hour walk from the beach arena.
The area is safe enough, because the favela pathetic, but the vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately think, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre barrier race and high jump Laura Ikauniece-Admi<0xC5><0x86>a lagged behind her personal records.
There are five disciplines.

In Latvia, the first production of the opera "Porgy and Bess" took place in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeatedly exhibited.
This is why the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>sis Art Festival and the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s <0xC5><0xA1>ederva.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja was the last time to enjoy an opera production, this great version of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" opera production can be enjoyed here at the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bo<0xC5><0xBE>e, the director of the concert hall "Great Amber".
The opera "Porgy and Bess" is a story told in a vivid musical language about love, its impermanence, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep," says director Viesturs Kairi<0xC5><0xA1>s.
What I like the most - when listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another, or choir or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by Andris Poga, the musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgy and Bess".
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
It’s good to be able to breathe the world.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert was special because the orchestra played for the first time in the orchestra pit in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" and the opera performance was performed for the first time.
The square next to the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
The Vice Mayor of Riga Andris Ameriks told at the opening of the Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls anniversary exhibition that the museum’s own address in the future could be not Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0x86>a Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ra iela 10a, but Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls Square 1.
The director of the museum, M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce, admitted that the re-registration of the address will create a significant bureaucratic burden, however, in general, this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed with the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, when it created the Burkards Dzenis monument to Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls, who stands at the museum.
Vilhelms Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, the then director of the museum, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little bit annoyed by my conscience all the time - but Wilhelms Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you promise to think, Mr. America," said L<0xC4><0x81>ce.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art was officially opened in May this year after extensive reconstruction and modernization.
This week, the VEF Culture Palace will finally be renovated.
The castle will be renovated by SIA "Velve" for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several premises of the castle, including two spectator halls, as well as adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
If you’re not sure what to do, then you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to do it.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace by attracting the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, will be the money allocated or not", says Burovs.
In December last year, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission saying that you are making your own decision that Brussels is not making a decision here.
Now we are seeing another circle of discussions being formed, well, then let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
“I want to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines,” says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Palace organized a farewell concert before the upcoming renovation of the building.
Although a year passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the palace.
The first is to increase the availability of the VEF Culture Palace and improve the surrounding territory.
It is planned to arrange the surrounding area and utilities, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is the improvement of the services offered by the VEF Culture Palace.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as to arrange the internal utilities of the building.
The third is the improvement of working conditions of creative amateur teams, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" legendary rock band can be seen at the exhibition in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
The exhibition will feature various objects characterizing "L<0xC4><0xAB>vus" - photos arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
In addition, the participants’ stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the wider public, which reflected the creative work of the band "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" will be shown.
The exhibition will be supplemented with Liepaja Museum collection items.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with fashion designer and painter Elita Patmalniece.
If you have any questions, please contact us by e-mail at the address indicated above.
The origins of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" date back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble led by Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols was created in the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Culture House.
The Ensemble in its original composition participated in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas amber" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republican shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place, when Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols met <0xC4><0x92>riks <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xAB><0xC4><0xB7>elis and founded a group in the Palace of Culture of Metallurgs, inviting Ingrids G<0xC5><0xAB>tmanis, Andris Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and J<0xC4><0x81>nis Grodums to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
But most importantly, the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist has remained unchanged.
"There was no shortage of things to see - jeans, hairy and beardy, these boys were noticeably different from the generally accepted stereotype of singer-songwriters," Klass V<0xC4><0x81>vere, a music reviewer, says about the band.
Apart from the musicians mentioned above, the band has featured such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Br<0xC4><0xAB>ze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Kleins and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.

For the first time in eight months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgaria's national statistics showed a monthly inflation of 1%.
This is the highest indicator since 2012 and the first above zero indicator since October last year, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after the CPI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% year-on-year.
Compared to the previous year, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate has been -0.2% (compared to December 2015) in July 2016 and -0.2% (compared to July 2015).
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 prices for the following groups of consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices dropped for clothing and footwear (2.2%); home appliances, household appliances and regular home cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbig<0xC5><0x86>evs Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s: Time is coming and the truth is rising.
The archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia Metropolitan Zbig<0xC5><0x86>evs Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s emphasizes in an interview with the Independent that if we want to gain strength in life, we must put the Gospel message at the centre of it.
For the power of the truth is greater than the infinity of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive this year?
In recent years, Pope Nuncio has expressed the desire to conduct the main worship in Aglona.
The content of the main message is therefore up to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that Bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis leads the way of the Cross.
He, too, will make his own message.
I was conducting a festive vigil the previous day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house captured in it, the theme of the Earth, in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I’m watching what’s happening in the world, and I’m trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach is in line with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message should be put at the heart of life.
It is necessary to show that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives inspiration for a further journey.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the Lampa discussion, you said that "it is necessary to return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have a resource for such a return?

Kolegova’s explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy due to contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In addition, it is important to note that it is not necessary to use the drug in the first place, because it is not recommended to use it in the first place.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of the European Union (EU) or the United Kingdom (EU).
The expert also believes that Kolegova has consulted both Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inskis before notifying about the withdrawal of the candidacy.

In the center of Riga this afternoon, there was a traffic accident involving a State Police car.
The police car, with the acoustic and light signals turned on, rushed to the highest category call, until it collided with another car at the intersection of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0x86>a Barona and Dzirnavu Street.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
A woman was injured in the accident.
This year, the population of Riga has decreased
In addition, it is important to note that in the event of an accident, it is important to take into account the nature of the accident and the consequences of the accident.
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with more than one million inhabitants.
According to the data of the EU statistical office "Eurostat", Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest percentage of women in Europe's largest cities: 123 in Vilnius and 121 in Tallinn for every 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed near the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be placed near the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMA), the Riga City Council Property Department representative Baiba Gail<0xC4><0xAB>te told LETA.
At the moment, the repair of the atrium damage caused by skateboarding has been successfully completed.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be placed next to it.

Is it possible to get rid of this disease?
This summer, Riga municipality has installed two more playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns, which are already available for children.
A wide, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, tubs and slides is installed on the beach of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xAB>psala.
Playground for children of all ages.
Swings and various balancing elements are also installed in the area.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is accentuated by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
In turn, a playground between the 4th and 5th crossroads of <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns has a playhouse, a trampoline, a step track, a balancing bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastic zone with rings for strength and coordination training, and other sports elements.
Rubber cover of different colors is laid underneath the area.
A new, colorful pavement is laid on the side of the street to the playground.
In the hunt, the reconstructed road section has been opened.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the State Roads of Latvia (LVC), as well as the representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the main state road Russian border (Grebneva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km).
Roads are the national business card, especially border roads, so it is a special satisfaction to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how the situation on the country's main roads is improving thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds.
"According to the forecasts, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be used already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue maintaining the most congested roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," Uldis Augulis emphasized by cutting the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that the proposals prepared by transport experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads in the near-facing time will be presented to the government.
Construction works in the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) started last year by SIA Binders and this year they continued after a technological break.
Reconstruction costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed section of the road, the construction of the road has been completely restored and next year the repair works will be started in the next section from Medumi to Daugavpils, thus the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged", informed J<0xC4><0x81>nis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The country's main roads are the most congested, and by 2018 we plan to make sure that all of the country's main roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring timely periodic maintenance and replacing the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all travellers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to arrange the road financing system", noted Lange.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting in the Medumi Centre have been arranged.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: in four stages large-scale decoction and extensive dredging and embankment works, the longitudinal profile of the road has been leveled, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been renovated and a turnaround area for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient bearing capacity and terrain was not visible due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renovate the road section from the Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144.80-156.40 km).
This year the LVC plans to carry out various types of works in more than 1100 kilometres of the national road.

"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, the right choice of food combinations is very important", admits the Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklierien<0xC4><0x97>.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A well-thought-out combination of nutritional products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel alive.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich foods, such as poultry or a protein cocktail, not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce cravings for large meals in subsequent meals.
Such a combination of meals is also able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat deposits in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a nutrient that promotes metabolism - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Sufficient intake of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels, and hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, controls greline - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus a feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are aids in weight reduction, as well as prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins can also do wonders in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, protein slows down the digestive process and provides a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with salad or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products should be avoided.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch contained in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits decompose in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not decompose until they reach the third or fourth degree of the digestive process that occurs in the intestine.
The starch is divided into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating a sweet dish immediately after a meal, it is "trapped" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrates with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, which is present in saliva, acts only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or combinations of nuts and milk and similar protein-rich foods in the same meal.
For their processing, different digestive juices are needed, each of them with different strength, features and time to get to the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, nutmeg and other melon should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat forms a successful combination with starch, however, the same can not be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you consume large amounts of protein, avoid the use of fat altogether.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (containing protein) with a whole avocado (containing fat).
Such a combination hampers effective weight loss.
How better to cook?
"Preparing food, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutritional content of the products," the nutritionist says.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by boiling foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by boiling.
It is recommended to use the remaining liquid after cooking the vegetables to make the soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables, also steaming them.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Thermal treatment of eggs and meat deprives them of the natural properties of the proteins they contain, making them easier to digest.
Also, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to be absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while freezing fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better functioning of the brain and muscles.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less of the non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereals than the blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-producing iron by eating non-blood-producing iron products in combination with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-producing iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
For maximum benefit from salads, add them healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardine-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, black currants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized for caricature of Asians
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in a rather absurd way on a daily basis.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that fits into a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are foggy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfies per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes publicly noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have been criticized in the past, having received reproaches that the app promotes too black or light skin tones as a benchmark of perfect beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to create sloppy eyes, sloppy teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow face”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
The news and public negativity broke out on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens is to depict anime characters, not to caricaturize people of Asian descent.
But for those who had experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
Grace Sparpani, an American art student of Korean origin, posted on Twitter about the images, which she said in her e-mail was "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the effect of the lens is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike older residents, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things do not go unnoticed," Katie Joe, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the product manager of Medium, Joe, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that in her view, race-related problems are due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Joe criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then closed his article with the reference <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so the following decisions are allowed: Whether there are some other racial representatives in the company, but they do not occupy a position that allows them to express their opinion safely and comfortably," says Joe, an American of Chinese descent.
Others share her view, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees of different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origins of its employees, but its spokesman found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on ensuring that racial minorities, who are underrepresented in the company, would also be represented in the company and would contribute to the company's integration.
Zhou, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right.”
The House of Congress says military officials have misrepresented reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement released on Thursday, the House of Congress said U.S. Central Command had misrepresented reports depicting war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than they actually are.
Central Command intelligence analysts express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force set up by the Republican representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence Financing, saying that their leadership was monitoring reports on American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report reports that the intelligence reports, endorsed by senior Centcom leaders, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than they actually are. The facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses suggest.
Ken Calvert, a representative of the Republicans of California, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable -- our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policymakers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors can be found in the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report details the ongoing problems in the Central Command’s presentation and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces for 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have misrepresented the reports, it shows that Centcom management has put some pressure on analysts to show a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that in the first half of 2015, the press releases, announcements and reports to Congress by the Central Management presented the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom officials publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq and is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, of the Republican Party of Kansas, said in a statement: "Several months of investigation clearly confirm this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. headquarters officials misrepresented the ISIS threat in Iraq as weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party set up a working group when it learned that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings on the case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence conducts investigations into the activities of Centcom's intelligence services.
Members of the intelligence governing committee of the Democratic Party released their own report on Thursday, in which they agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party Working Group.
Democrat Adam B. Schiff says in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports on ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information, worsened the ethics of analysts' work, and "spreaded facts that are not true."
But Schiff and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports in line with “predetermined or political positions.”
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the report as the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Agency call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful (an allegation made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Command on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence recalls more than a decade of events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hoeker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghan war with too little thought about its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in uncovering the issue of Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hooker's team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air strikes on Islamic State oil factories did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The September issue of The Times reported that the discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Administration.
General Lloyd Austin III, the commander of Centcom at the time, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers believed that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Wattel.
In the US duel with the United Kingdom in women's field hockey, the United States wins, thus gaining its fourth consecutive victory.

In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug in the treatment of cystic fibrosis is not always possible.
She said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who scores their goals.
In addition, it is important to note that in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to ensure that the rules of the internal market are applied in a manner that is consistent with the Union's internal market.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the final match in the first round games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which will take the second place.
The first place winner will avoid meeting with the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug does not cause any side effects, but it can also cause serious side effects.
This team also included Bam.
She grew up in Blubel, took the field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already involved in the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a team for the youngest players in history.
She did not attend the 2008 Olympics because she did not qualify for the final.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The next year, Craig Parham was appointed as the team's coach, and everything changed for the better.
Bam called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
We did not do as much work in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
In the game Thursday, Bama revealed the result, scored a goal in the first half with a rear shooting from a close distance.
India started the game without winning in their account, but their team was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0-1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly scored.
She entered the ball into the opponent's area on the left side of the field, then managed to get to the middle of the field and fire the ball into the opponent's goal, leading the American 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Brig's dry game, with one goal in each of the first three games.
She's stuck.
Same with Bam.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but how well, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is "Foody Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver pâté (Fuagra) and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding in the dessert.
Jane Ziegelman says: "This is a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were going very hard."
Her husband, Andriu Kou, adds: "This is also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
A couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Kou’s last book, Vegetable Stew, describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane’s book, The 97 Aprons, describes life through a food rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, "The Rich Meal," to be published Tuesday by publishing house Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they had a meal together with reporter Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple dining restaurant located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered a salad of turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered a fake hare, the couple admitted that his choice was very relevant to the conversation about food from the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the fake hare was very popular.
There was a peanut hare, a liver hare, and a bean hare.
They were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you want for lunch.
Mr. Kou shouted.
"It probably seemed like the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled a buffet, especially in rural areas.
The women prepared meals for their husbands-workers, and at breakfast, lunch and dinner they were served freshly prepared puff pastry.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. The "Foody Meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main focus of the American people's daily life," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on this subject.
The new budget diets became equally important: unknown foods such as the fake hare and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Ms. Ziegelmane, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste, new, unprecedented formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Ms. Ziegelmane found a recipe for onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the dining table."
Mrs. Ziegelmane emphasizes: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are not compatible.
Many home cooking recipes adapted to the difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the national eating habits that were unprecedented before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economicians" and take on challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a tasty meal.
"Foody Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens is particularly interesting, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and meals in Iowa, he actually ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in the almost gold-plated living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was totally detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended that he set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who did not know how to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most unsightly dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst cooked dishes".
As soon as the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary habits of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Ms. Ziegelmane.
The couple tells that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said: "She actually pranked people."
Once upon a time there was an incident with wind cakes.
After we had eaten in Eisenberg’s dining room, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert out of their bag: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's plum whipped cream," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at that time it was a common habit to give modest dishes a chic name.
It does not contain whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently soaked spoons in the brown mass that was on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economist", he told his wife: "It would be a pinch of ground hazelnut."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for hepatitis C patent
A district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of lawyers’ fees paid in a case for breaking a patent for hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was acquitted of a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine for breaching two Merck patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a US federal judge found infringements of Merk’s activities, such as lying after taking the oath and other unethical acts.
At a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bet Labson Freeman said Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal costs it incurs to defend itself in the case.
Merck is trying to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of the Gilead drug.
U.S.-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The US-backed forces have taken control of the city of Manbij in the northern part of the country, along the Turkish border, and the last soldiers of the Islamic State have left the city, a group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently purging the city from the last opposing fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilian hostages that were captured by militants, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters from the SDS's allied Manbija Military Council.
"The city is now under our full control and we are conducting a search for fighters," he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clintons revenue reached <0x24>10.75 million and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband earned <0x24>10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, the Clintons have donated <0x24>1 million, mostly to their Clinton charity. Former president Bill Clinton earned about <0x24>5.3 million by acting as a speaker and former secretary of state earned <0x24>3 million in revenue from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug does not cause any side effects, but it is important to take into account the fact that the drug does not cause any side effects.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind various excuses and reservations so as not to keep his promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite the State Revenue Service audit as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
“Your move,” Ian Sam, Clinton’s campaign partner, tweeted about the Democrat candidate’s tax information.
Trump's special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mit Romney and other Republicans, say his refusal raises questions about his real estate, donations and other business obligations, including his relationship with Russia.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of a child who has been born in the United States for a long time.
She returned to this issue again during an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
In the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no taxes for two years, according to Politico, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a key issue in these presidential elections.
In support of billionaire Varen Buffett's proposal, Clinton promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than <0x24>1 million a year must pay at least 30% tax.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton’s speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also being audited by the Revenue Service and that Trump was afraid of voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton Campaign has publicised tax information until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chapakwa, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and an overall tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons have received <0x24>109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for disabling Israeli long-distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of the Jewish-French film set off a storm on social media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli long-range code. The staff of the hotel justify this by the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentary "Shoah" about the Holocaust, did not hide his dissatisfaction with Berlin's "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli long-distance code on the hotel’s list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was swept away and destroyed?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "has shocked him".
The hotel administrator explained that “this is a conscious decision of the hotel management.”
The reason for the removal of the code further angered the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted a hotel employee as saying.
In the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as a “great shame”.
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this happened in Germany is even more humiliating in this hotel chain.
Explanations are not required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also gained a fairly wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply been enjoyed by Arab customers.
Another post said "be ashamed" of the hotel, which is located on Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug in the treatment of the disease is not always possible, but it is important to note that the drug is not used in the treatment of the disease.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Kempinski's spokesman is quoted by the Suddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
And then again, the code was added to the list.
The police are using rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students rallied against the government's education system reforms.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The problems began when the ombudsmen tried to drive out students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration in order to show their opposition to the reforms of the education system.
Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmina's proposal is to close nearly 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
The protest came just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to express their support for the suspended president Dilma Roussef, whose impeachment was voted by the Senate.
Scott Kelm Skinner finishes first in bringing a gold medal to Britain in cycling
Kelm Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Cycling Course last night. The British team secured their championship title at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the proud legendary Scottish Sir Chris Hoy a winner for the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated this at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
The problem was between Beijing and London Olympics, because it was necessary to replace the experienced starter specialist Jamie Stauff.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When Hoy left, his place was filled by Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
The British coaches put their hopes on Skinner, seeing the potential in him, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who four years ago competed with Hoy and Skinner, who set the record for the Olympic qualification, but the race was better for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindes were in tight circles, Kenny took the lead, and Skinner guarded that leadership.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes drove with a larger gear to allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to drive faster.
He watched the race as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow said, "It was an inexpressible honor."
I am doing everything I can to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and defeated the World Champions.
It was simply unbelievable.
There's no better win.
After winning with Kenya and Hoy at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes admitted that they had deliberately fallen on the track after a failed start.
It’s not the only way to get rid of it.
This time there were no incidents.
Hinde said: "British flags on the stands reminded me of London."
In the last 3 months we have become a team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal in the race for the country that won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the team's progress over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the Kenyan result, he could indeed repeat Hoy's success in winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenny, this would mean six gold medals and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a British holy date, as on that day Steve Raew, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were also born).
On this date, Hoy was also born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed knight."
It was the only medal fight that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clansey, Steve Burke and Owen Doouls showed the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometre race.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigin will definitely be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the commissariat when the judges called him to measure his height.
Laura Trot, Joanna Rovsel Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngau set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which will take place in the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the future of digital Single Market.
But when the first cycling race begins, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland smelter is becoming uncertain due to the termination of an ambitious contract.
The future of the aluminum smelter and its hundreds of employees in Portland, Victoria has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
The announcement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital to the company's continued operation.
The 20-year grants will end in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the melter consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the Angleseas power plant shutdown.
The Alcoa Portland Smelter is loss-making and may be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation on the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The factory energy supplier AGL, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts as well.
Most of the power plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, in addition to the company’s shares are owned by China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL hopes for the continued operation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further supply of energy to the smelter," said its spokesman.
AGL said the agreements are so-called “risk-restricting agreements” that are expected to come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts in fiscal year 2017 as well," said the company's representative.
Starting from the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market prospects for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already estimated a loss of <0x24>187 million in its forecasts, predicting that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the operation of the smelter or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company says that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not explain why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
Steven Mickelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year.
If these two plants were to leave the energy market, energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160,000 people are rejected, and the situation could deteriorate as budgets shrink.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal evictions - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that the situation will become worse as funding decreases.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the latest report from the National Association of Legal Centers says that legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people in need.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not lifted, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Center is constantly getting underfunded, which means thousands of people in need are being denied help."
People who are trying to put an end to violent relationships, people who are deeply indebted, families who are going through divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to stop the cuts immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also focus on the needs of local communities and their customers, and the Palazchuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign sued for gun pulled out of staff
New York: Donald Trump's campaigners have been sued for failing to act after being informed that their North Carolina operations chief turned a gun against an employee when they drove in the same car in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed at Charlotte Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordi said he had been waiting for months for the case to be examined internally, but he realized that it wouldn’t happen.
Head Earl Phillip "draw the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that when he complained to the local and regional campaign management, he found out that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
“Weapons don’t have to shoot to inflict damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican Party presidential candidate triggered a scandal, telling people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges won the election.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and he had never incited violence.

Is it possible to get rid of this disease?
I couldn't get in touch with Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
He also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".

A new tradition - a parish and sports festival in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
This is the first time people have gathered in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems for a parish and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that the Lake Festival would no longer exist.
A new page has now been redirected.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in traditional ways and was not taken too seriously, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a sleeping target, the boot was flying, with the left hand of a person thrown, "balls" were not at all in any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, agile and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered on the open-air stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could smash into inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face gritter.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was a parade of motorcycles and tractors.
If you’re not sure what to do, you’re probably not sure what to do with it, but you’re not sure what to do with it, or if you’re not sure what to do with it.
The festival continued with the greetings of the youngest residents of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
It’s really good that the parish has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
In addition, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have launched a public consultation on the future of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in order to assess the impact of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on the financial stability of the euro area.
And it's no problem that someone slipped on the wet stage.
Of course, local people and visitors were delighted by the famous actor duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jar<0xC4><0x81>ns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Nabi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and Skaidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Krani<0xC5><0x86>a, as well as the attractive wives of B<0xC4><0x93>rzciems from the fishermen's farm Dieni<0xC5><0x86>as.
The ball was played by the band Bru<0xC4><0xA3>is.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but throughout the country.
This makes Heathrow, in my opinion, very attractive, as was the case in London in 2012, where we invested a tremendous amount of work to ensure that all regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and East End won tremendously from the Olympics.
And we'll do it again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, this time there will be people who will believe that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics on time and that it would be a global failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and in the case of Heathrow they would be wrong.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the benefit of society as a whole, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, with a timeline and budget ranging from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years, to Terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensively used runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be funded by private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the case with the expansion of Heathrow.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of the Board of Heathrow and a former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on a highway trying to commit suicide.
The victim lay down on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when she crossed several cars on a highway early Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vo.
A report from the cantonal police said the woman, desperate to commit suicide, was lying on a road in the dark where she was hit by several cars.
In a clear attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss, drove several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug in the treatment of the disease does not cause any side effects, but it is important to note that the drug is not prescribed for the treatment of the disease.
The case is also the subject of a criminal investigation, which is a logical step, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: "The prosecutor will find out."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had walked out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing when she drove a man in August 2014 who was sleeping on the A1 road near Paijern in the middle of the night.
It was found out in court that the 22-year-old victim had drunk and later found himself asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman, who was on the way to the accident site, drove in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was a "completely unpredictable and extraordinary event".
Anyone who has information about the Thursday accident near Morges is welcome to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a movie like this.
In the petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), it is indicated that the public wants a transparent and professional process for appointing officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and has now been signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating Inga Kolegova, the candidate for the position of the SRS Director General, is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best traditions of the functionalists of the Soviet Union.
It discredits the public administration and once again disappoints the public in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates should be evaluated," says the petition's text.
Its author J<0xC4><0x81>nis B. pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria for choosing Kolegov for the position.
It is also unclear what the candidates intend to do at the SRS.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, recruited personnel selection specialists and appropriate remuneration is offered.
In addition, the European Commission has adopted a proposal for a Regulation on the establishment of a European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and a European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).
It’s also a good time to start a new business.
In addition, the European Commission and the Member States should be able to take the necessary measures in order to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market and to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market.
In order to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, Member States should be able to provide for the application of the provisions of this Directive in the field of health and safety at work.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
In addition, it is important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
In the first set, we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we stayed for 16 points," Sm<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> remembered the course of the game.
I don’t even know how we left the rest of the set without points.
You can't play like that.
After that, in the second set everything was fine and in the end of the set it was possible to break the game, in addition, it should have been a good basis for the third set.
We started in a similar way, but after we exchanged sides, the result grew only for one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so the small points were important.
“We should have played more like that, rather than giving 3-4 points in a row several times,” said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be reserved.
“In the first set we dealt with it, in the second we put 1-2 points, and in the third at +4 he already left the game,” remembered Sm<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it came, sometimes it didn’t.
I didn’t see the overall score before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
“If we lost, then I played badly,” said Samoylov.
We were expecting a good service from Evandra, and we managed it quite well in the first sets, but in the third one the service opened for him and it was difficult to make an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes in the reception right at Pedra Serve, but it had to be dealt with.

We had a chance to fight for the first place, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
"All of us were expecting a medal, and we were expecting a medal from ourselves, but after that there is no difference anymore - 25th place or the fourth place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov had his third Olympic career in Rio de Janeiro, as he competed with M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Plavi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> in Beijing in 2008 and played with Ruslan Sorokin in London four years ago.

"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The State energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of both a consumer and a potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the company's press secretary.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by the gas market model and legal framework."
"Therefore, we are actively involved in the development and commenting on regulatory enactments, as well as submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The Agency has already written to BNS that the Ministry of Economics in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company "Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze" has developed the Cabinet of Ministers draft regulations "Regulations on the sale and use of natural gas" which will change the existing principles of operation of the natural gas market, ensuring the right of natural gas users to freely choose a natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
While working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "centric model of the trader" has been chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one point of provision of information and customer service, leaving technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
We would like to remind you that a gradual opening of the market is planned for household customers – even after April 3, 2017, those household customers who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related customers.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected customers at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, the merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader, with whom they must conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of a natural gas trade contract for a specified period of time, merchants shall ensure the trade of natural gas by the previous natural gas trader at the price specified therein.
The draft Cabinet Regulations detail the rights and duties of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
This Regulation prescribes the procedures by which customers shall be supplied with natural gas and the supply thereof shall be interrupted, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and duties of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures by which payments for the received services shall be made, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for changing traders and supply of customers in case of natural gas supply disruption; the public trader.

In the case of the current head of the State Revenue Service Dacis Gre<0xC4><0xBC>ko, who expressed her readiness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated the opinion that the new Director-General of the State Revenue Service should be "from the outside" and that it should not come from the structure of the State Revenue Service.
She also emphasized that she is waiting for the Saeima to return from the holiday in order to push the amendments to the laws that are necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS as soon as possible.

Oil prices continue to rise; stock indices in the US and Europe and the value of the US dollar are rising.
World oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors feeling positively influenced by statements by the Saudi oil minister, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing countries will act to stabilise the global oil market at the OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock indices hit record highs on Thursday, unseen since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in the European stock indexes.
The US dollar appreciated against the euro on Thursday, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
The price of WTI crude oil for deliveries in September rose by <0x24>1.78 to <0x24>43.49 per barrel on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The price of Brent crude oil for deliveries on the London stock exchange in October rose by <0x24>1.99 to <0x24>46.04 per barrel.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
The company’s turnover last year was 4.202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company’s losses decreased 5.7 times – to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial statement published in the Lursoft database.
The company’s management report says that in 2015 the company was loss-making due to a number of reasons, including a persistent lack of working capital caused by the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating the previously existing credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility of fulfilling them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large volumes and receive a volume discount.
The exit of the respective bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural fund support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial indicators in the lead year were negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the products produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged the price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - the highest - prices," the company's management said.
Also in 2015 "Blue Lagoon" started negotiations with potential investors, including valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have become acquainted and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased, which ensures a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production facility to fulfill orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since letters of intent on the sale of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold according to the letters of intent.
The new product will increase the turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management says.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, Blue Lagoon sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and in September this year will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Blue Lagoon" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and losses of 5.113 million euros.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and its share capital is 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igors <0xC5><0xA0>ir<0xC5><0xA1>ons (10.89%).
Welcome to the cinema diva Zara Leander and take part in the press conference at 15 a.m. at the museum.
Riga can be seen as the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the adored cinematic diva Sarah Leander.
The visit of Sarah Lender to her mother-in-law Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned fateful in Riga in 1924, because it was she who discovered the unusual low contralt of Sarah Lendere, which she tried debuting on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Perhaps it was the accidental sensuality in Riga that became the fateful turn in Sara’s creative journey towards world fame.
Riga was associated with warm memories for Sarah Leander, and she hoped to come to Riga in guest performances, but unfortunately, these hopes were not destined to come true because World War II began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the role of the outstanding Sarah Leander will be played by the great Ieva Ker<0xC4><0x93>vica.
There are extensive traffic restrictions in Aglona area.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Heaven, from 12 August from 17:00 to 15 August from 18:00, the transit traffic of lorries on several state roads in the area of Aglona will be closed, the State Roads of Latvia informed SJSC.
This is the first time I’ve seen it in my life.
It should be noted that on the section of the motorway P62 Kr<0xC4><0x81>slava-Prei<0xC4><0xBC>i-Madona from Kr<0xC4><0x81>slava to Kr<0xC4><0x81>slava station (0.80-4.00 km) construction works are underway and only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the construction site during Aglona Festival.
For other traffic participants, traffic will be provided on the bypass road - the scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants, including pilgrims, come to this celebration.
Therefore, motorists should be especially careful, because on various road routes in the direction of Aglona there will be an intensive pedestrian movement.
Drivers are encouraged to be aware of the traffic restrictions introduced, to follow the traffic organisation, as well as to take into account the possible longer travel time.
The water temperature in all water bodies has dropped below +20 degrees.
In addition to the cold weather, the water temperature continues to decrease, and currently it is below +20 degrees in all rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea, according to the data of the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
In the sea the water has cooled to +16..+18 degrees, on the western coast of the Gulf of Riga under the influence of wind the water temperature has dropped to +13 degrees, in Roja at times to +9 degrees.

Kurdish activists occupy the building of the German public broadcaster.
A group of 30 Kurds occupied the building of the public broadcaster WDR in Düsseldorf on Thursday night, holding a nearly two-hour protest, German police said.
Demonstrators who came with posters were chanting slogans, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
The officials said the demonstration was generally peaceful and the protesters eventually voluntarily left the building at the request of the workers.
The insurer pays compensation to passengers of the flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid a travel insurance indemnity to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, due to which they had to refuse to attend the planned music festival.
On August 11, in If Insurance, a claim for compensation was received from a client.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to flights cancelled at the airport on Wednesday, the client was charged a fee for the accommodation reservation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchase of festival tickets in the amount of 204 euros.
In turn, the airline has promised to compensate customers for the money spent on airline tickets.
If Insurance has paid compensation for interruption or cancellation of the trip in an average of 15% of all travel insurance claims.
"In such cases, the expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation are reimbursed", says Dagnija Rutka, Head of Insurance Risk Insurance for Persons.
As is known, on the evening of 10 August a private aircraft stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical problems, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
As a result of the neighbor’s repair, the man is forced to leave his home.

The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and the ceiling in my apartment is damaged.
I then informed the Riga Construction Authority, the house manager and other organizations.
It’s also a good idea to start a new business.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be some expert from there," Dmitrijs says.
The invited expert has arrived, recorded what happened and acknowledged that the covering is in an unsatisfactory condition.
But a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application to the building authority, and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether staying in the apartment is life-threatening.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who isn’t interested in you.
“Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they forwarded the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then there is a dead end,” says Dmitry.
After examining the entire pile of papers, it is clear that construction works have been suspended, even though one can hear from time to time that someone is working there.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
The independent expert has developed his own opinion, but the construction authority considers it to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this load-bearing structure has been affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"Therefore, we have requested further clarification from this expert," says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in this particular case the penalty can be much more severe.
While awaiting the expert opinion, the building board has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both the apartment in which the construction works are taking place and Dmitry's apartment.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the construction authority, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have posed a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the construction authority.
Now Dmitry remains to look for another place to live - at relatives, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry may try to recover the damage from his neighbor in a civil procedure, which can take a lot of time.
Because of arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the civil engineer gives his conclusion, and this may have to wait up to three weeks.
The loss will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment, because he has not taken into account the words of the Construction Board, is also threatened with imprisonment for a period of up to six months.
Guess it now!

The conversion of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will cost 22 million euros, says Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve, the representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri".
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former sanatorium in Kemeri.
The second stage will be wellness or wellness clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is planned for May 2018.
Is there anything you can do to protect yourself?
In addition, it will be located in the building of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri resort polyclinic, which covers an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
"Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and the owner of the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe is owned by several investors who invest money in the fund, according to <0xC5><0xBD>elve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million in the development of the former resort polyclinic, with a total investment of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
It has already been announced that in the renovation of the cultural and historical park in an area of more than 42 hectares, in the restoration of access roads and street sections, in the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, in the improvement of the territory and in the construction of a parking lot on Em<0xC4><0xAB>la D<0xC4><0x81>rzi<0xC5><0x86>a Street, which will promote the socio-economic development of Jurmala city and increase the number of tourists, the Jurmala municipality plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the European Union funds.
Design works are planned until mid-2017, but construction and arrangement works will begin in autumn of next year.
It is reported that a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and a wellness clinic are planned to be built in the historic sanatorium complex "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri".
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
The 2010 report also stated that Ominasis regularly communicates with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control at the sanatorium <0xC4><0xB6>emeri, and that the reconstruction of the future hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri will be completed already in 2011 and the preparatory work for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" confirmed its willingness to purchase a set of the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia"-owned <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium property at an auction, but a month later the auction was declared not to take place because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was determined according to the starting price of the last unsuccessful auction - EUR 2.86 million.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, lay down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation, including on the basis of the information provided by the Member States in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2).
The President will present the Order of the Three Stars to the opera singer Antonenko.
If you’re not sure what to do, then you’re not sure what to do.
The awarding ceremony of the Order of the Three Stars will take place at the House of Blackheads at 13:00.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from J<0xC4><0x81>zeps Medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> College of Music in 1998, where he studied wind instruments and learned singing at Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the J<0xC4><0x81>zeps V<0xC4><0xAB>tols Latvian Academy of Music in the vocal department of Arv<0xC4><0xAB>ds Luste class.
In 1997, he started singing at the Latvian National Opera Choir, but in 1998, he made his debut with Oberto’s role in G.F. Handel’s opera Al<0xC4><0xAB>na.
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" for vocal performance in operas and Verdi Requiem.
It is noted that in 2004/2005 season has become the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, who is engaged by the largest opera theatres in the world.
Since autumn 2004, he has been singing at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, Berlin and Graz, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden in London, the Monte Carlo opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Opera and the Salzburg Festival.

A year later, Antonenko performed with great success the role of Othello in the London Covent Garden Opera.
The e-mail of former NATO commander Bridlow was hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the National Committee of Democrats (DNC) may have carried out several other cyberattacks, including an email from former NATO European Commander Philip Bridlow and the Open Society Institute of George Soros, Bloomberg news agency said on Thursday.
The hackers have published the information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, Bridlow’s correspondence and information about the Soros Institute’s work are included there.
For hackers, the institute's computers have been available for a year.
In addition, it is important to note that it is not necessary to take the drug for a long time.
The Wall Street Journal reports that President Barack Obama’s administration is currently considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the DNC’s computer hacking.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will officially have to prosecute the servers of the Democratic Party against Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities in a cyberattack.
WikiLeaks reportedly released about 20,000 e-mails in July from the DNC's computer system, suggesting that Democratic Party leaders were trying to undermine the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's former rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders' campaign for a Democratic nomination to the presidential election.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the hacking of Democrats’ servers, as well as other US special services, said Russia’s involvement in the cyberattack was almost indisputable.
McCartney: The presence of Yoko Ono threatened the Beatles.
Paul McCartney admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of threat to the legendary Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently has a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but while she was going to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was scared because Ono was the only woman among the band's members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine: "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the boosters.
Most of the groups could not tolerate it.
We were able to do it, but not very successful, because we were very tense.
We weren’t sexists, but the girls usually didn’t come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John started meeting Yoko, she was not in the control room, but in the middle of us four.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former bandmate Ringo, and from time to time approves the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" are "out of business".
Asked if he still meets the other single living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often no."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don’t go to meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at that table."
It was too painful as if we were seeing our pet dying.
The company is now working in such a way that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously guessed that Venus’s slow rotational velocity is due to its dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations suggest that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and rotated slowly.
The model also looks at the previous topography of Venus.
There were more dry areas on the planet than there were on Earth, but there was enough water and geographic diversity on it to form life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a simulation of the GISS model, the rotation model of Venus reveals that the daylight on it lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a temperate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model represents the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once inhabitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the vapors were burned out by ultraviolet rays.
As the water evaporated completely, only a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus as we know it today - remained.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Avalanche Coach
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which will take place in Brussels on 15 and 16 November.
In addition, it is important to note that it is not necessary to use the drug for a long time.
“For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful in my role as head coach and vice president of ice hockey operations at Colorado Club,” said Roy, 50, in a statement.
During this summer, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team’s performance in order to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve a higher level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of ice hockey operations must fully coincide with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions related to team performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the League's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, the Colorado team was defeated by the Minnesota ice hockey team. Since then, the club has not entered the playoffs for two years.
The Avalanche ended the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without receiving a second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
In his career, Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil platform resume talks and postpone strike
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the case of a child who has not been vaccinated.
There are periodic strikes against the oil processing company “Wood Group” on the North Sea oil rigs, where the company “Royal Dutch Shell” operates.
In a joint statement, the Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
In the coming weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to start early next week with the aim of re-examining the issues at stake.
Trade unions said their recent events, organised after more than 25 years, were against the planned 30 percent cut in wages.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced wages of onshore workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, in turn, has already cut wages for several thousand people and announced plans to shut down oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is compounded by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish Parliamentary Deputy Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, nearly <0x24>1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to <0x24>7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleiades constellation.
Kepler's latest telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the speed of stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotational speed of stars can be attributed to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech's Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Luisa Rebula.
The constellation of the Pleiade is located 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to rise, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at maximum speed.
When rotating at maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As stars age, their rotational speed decreases.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by measuring the time between the appearance of recognizable areas of stars, such as sunspots.
The newest catalog of the speed of rotation of stars shows that larger stars spin slower than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars to dancers, and larger dancers perform more slowly than small dancers.
Rebul tells that in the Ballet of Pleiades, slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to its proximity to the constellation of Pleiade, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where the characteristics of the stars can be compared with the rotational speeds.
Rebul says that the Pleiades constellation helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of rotation of stars slows down and about the complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades stars in three new publications that will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
