When an English-speaking person notices that the foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand something from what he says, he repeats exactly the same, but louder as if this person were deaf. At no time does he come to the mind that his choice of words might be complicated, or that his expression might be easy for the foreigner to understand, and that he could say it simply with other words. As a result, a person not only still does not understand what he says, but also becomes irritated by the fact that he is considered deaf.
